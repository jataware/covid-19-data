SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDER: HERE’S WHAT IT MEANS

The order was unanimously adopted around 5:20 p.m. the urging of Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin. Besides the purposes outlined in the ordinance, Birmingham residents are to remain in their homes. The penalty for violating the ordinance is up to 30 days in jail.

The “shelter-in-place” ordinance goes into effect immediately and stands until April 3 at 12 a.m. According to the city municipal code, a violation of a city ordinance is punishable by up to 180 days in jail and/or up to a $500 fine.

“We have to do everything we can to prevent community spread. The ultimate goal is to save lives,"" the mayor told the council. “What we’re doing, it goes against human nature because we are by definition social creatures. But I am convinced ... if we make the tough hard decisions now and hunker down then the faster we can get back to our normal way of life.”

Councilor Hunter Williams said the order is “in the best interests of the city of Birmingham.”

“It’s a tough decision knowing this will curb the economic landscape within the city of Birmingham, but I think in the long run ... we will have an opportunity to flatten that curve.”

Councilor John Hilliard said the order is necessary and that he would lose sleep at night if the city stood idly by while the virus spreads. He said Birmingham’s economic health is dependent on its residents’ physical health.

“I love this city and I want it to thrive, but we need people to thrive with it,"" Hilliard said.

Said Councilor Chrystal Smitherman, “I would rather do the most I can to protect the public and have y’all be mad at us than you getting mad later for us not doing enough.”

A shelter-in-place order would quicken the time for Birmingham to return to normalcy, said Councilor Clinton Woods.

“The quicker we get through this crisis, the faster we get back to business,” he said. ""We wait another week and [a shelter-in-place order] could be late.”

Woodfin said the rapid rise in cases, and hospitalizations at UAB, requires more stringent rules. The order will not prevent people from leaving their homes. The shelter in place asks residents to only leave their homes for essential purposes like going to the grocery store, doctor or work, Woodfin said.

“We urgently need the public’s cooperation today. If you haven’t started social distancing, please do so now,” said Sarah Nafziger co-chair, UAB’s Emergency Management Committee.

Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin says 45 people with COVID-19 are being treated at UAB. He says 18 of those patients are on a ventilator. — Anna Beahm (@_AnnaBeahm) March 24, 2020

Officials with the Jefferson County Health Department were at the press conference and expressed support for the new rules.

“I recognize how big the sacrifice is, but this is our moment. It’s our moment to beat the virus. In order to be able to come out on the other side we have to do this. We will overcome,” said Dr. Wes Willeford with the JCDH.

Woodfin noted that the ordinance is not in conflict with county restrictions on the closures of non-essential businesses and the city is not adding to that list of businesses. Industries that are not on the non-essential list can still open for business, including manufacturing, logistics, supply chain, distribution, construction and law firms.

The order also allows for solitary exercise activities.

“You want to run, you want to hike, you want to bike, we encourage you to do that,"" Woodfin said.

City officials say the goal of the shelter in place ordinance is not to spur large-scale arrests.

“The intent is not to arrest anyone or put anyone in jail, but there must be a balance to make sure people comply with the law and the health department,” said city spokesman Rick Journey. Journey said Birmingham’s ordinance is not out of line with what other cities have done.

Other cities have enacted “shelter in place” orders. In Birmingham, the city has been under restrictions set by the county health officer and clarified on Sunday night. Fines under state law for violating public health orders can be $500 daily.

Under this proposal, the penalties available under the municipal code would apply, including a fine up to $500 and/or up to 180 days in the city jail. (Code 1-1-6 here)

The mayor told the council, which reconvenes at 4 p.m. to consider the measure, the city needs greater authority to disperse crowds and keep people off the streets.

The City of Jemison has taken steps to protect employees and the public in light of confirmed coronavirus (COVID-19) cases.

During a scheduled meeting on March 16, Mayor Eddie Reed read a statement outlining some of the measures the city has taken and other plans were presented by Deputy Chief Marc McMinn and City Clerk Vicki Potts.

“I don’t think any of us understand the full impact of this thing (coronavirus),” Reed said. “No one does. We are wrestling with this, but we’ve got to come together (on a plan of action).”

He said the city is not waiting to react to the crisis but is being proactive in planning.

The Jemison library, auditorium and city park are closed to the public at this time.

“The Jemison City Hall will have restricted access to citizens, requiring citizens to handle business through the drive through window, including water bills,” according to a press release.

Potts said water bills can also be paid online or through the drop box.

Plans for keeping multiple workers from getting sick in the same department had already been put in place prior to the meeting. Water maintenance department supervisor Steve Langston had approached the mayor with concerns about multiple employees being exposed to the virus if one employee in the department got it. Langston developed a plan where employees are limiting close contact in groups by not eating together and working in separate small groups.

“We are being proactive,” Reed said.

Additional measures taken by city hall staff include using gloves, hand sanitizer and disinfectant spray. Items used by multiple people are being sprayed with disinfectant after each person uses them, and employees are refraining from using anyone else’s desk and office supplies.

The police department is also regularly using gloves and hand sanitizer as phase one of a response plan. Additional measures would be taken if the plan reaches phase two or three. If an officer is required to be quarantined, the Jemison Police Department and the Thorsby Police Department would work together to respond to calls as needed. McMinn said this would not change the court jurisdiction in which a case was tried.

“We are going to assist them,” McMinn said. “They are going to assist us if it comes to that point.”

City hall staff are also considering work-from-home options.

Residents needing assistance are encouraged to call City Hall at 205-688-4491 with questions, rather than stopping by.

Flights, which were suspended at Egyptian airports on March 19 until the end of the month, will remain grounded for an additional two weeks until April 15.

A closure of schools and universities will also be extended to mid-April, while cafes, sports clubs and gyms will be shut for the next two weeks and restaurants will be restricted to deliveries.

Shops other than food stores and pharmacies will be required to close from 5 p.m., two hours earlier than previously, as well as at weekends.

Those who do not respect the new rules face fines of up to 4,000 Egyptian pounds ($255) or prison, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly told a televised press briefing.

“I call on all Egyptians to fully comply with these measures,” President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Twitter. “And I affirm that all elements of the Egyptian state will confront any attempts to breach them with the utmost firmness and resolution.”

The number of coronavirus cases confirmed by the health ministry rose by 36 on Tuesday to 402. There was one new death, bringing the total to 20.

Senior officials have sought to reassure the public that they are able to contain coronavirus and that information on cases is being released quickly and transparently.

“Compared to surrounding countries, we are still at the stage of being able to contain the spread of the epidemic,” Madbouly said.

Ahead of the briefing, state TV aired a video that highlighted strict measures taken in China to combat coronavirus, with a caption “Egypt can defeat coronavirus like China.”

Later the presidency released pictures of Sisi inspecting trucks adapted by the army to carry large disinfectant sprayers and hoses.

Authorities face a challenge tackling the virus in a country of 100 million where many live in fertile areas around the Nile and public health services can be severely stretched.

In some densely populated residential districts in Cairo, daily street life has appeared largely unaffected until now, though with lighter traffic.

On social media, many criticised the government for not halting services in mosques and churches before Saturday, when that decision was announced.

Listing the latest measures, Madbouly said almost all government offices would now close their doors to the public. He urged citizens to limit movement between towns and cities, and said a measure to restrict the number of government employees going to work would be prolonged until mid-April.

Separately, the government said it was allocating one billion Egyptian pounds ($63.69 million) to the health ministry to help it provide supplies.

Like other countries, Egypt has taken steps to curtail the impact of coronavirus on the economy, including a surprise 3% interest rate cut and an injection of 20 billion Egyptian pounds to support the stock market.

A letter sent to the state’s congressional delegation on March 20 outlines the need for emergency aid to students and institutions, technology funding, supplemental research funding and access to low-cost capital amid a worsening economic and public health crisis caused by the novel coronavirus.

The letter is signed by 20 state leaders of public and private higher education, including University of Colorado system President Mark Kennedy and Naropa University President Charles Lief.

The Colorado letter is similar to a memo written by 11 national higher education groups, which together represent nearly every college and university in the United States.

That memo requested more than $50 billion in aid for colleges and universities. The stimulus package approved by Congress on Wednesday allocated approximately $14 billion for higher education.

Universities and colleges in Colorado will likely lose $100 million in revenue to refunds and credits for room and board this year, according to state higher education leaders.

Many institutions, including the University of Colorado Boulder, asked students to leave campus to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The Colorado letter requests direct emergency aid for students and institutions based on enrollment and the number of low-income students, with up to $1,500 going to individual students. It also requests that $7.8 billion be spent nationally to help institutions move all students to online-only education.

The letter also requests Congress provide additional funding for research, including COVID-19-related research, and access to zero-interest refinancing and loans.

“As our congressional delegation, we ask you to continue to work with our institutions as Congress identifies ways to address both the immediate burdens, and the long-term impacts to our students, institutions and communities,” the letter states.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, D-Boulder, said he supports protections for students and staff impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.

“As a member of House Leadership, I continue to advocate for policies that would provide student loan debt relief, stabilization funds for states, local governments and higher education institutions, and other measures to safeguard our students and colleges and universities throughout the state,” Neguse said.

A spokeswoman for Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said he also received a copy of the letter from state higher education leaders.

“These are trying times for both students and institutions, and (Bennet) understands the unique challenges both face as campuses close and transition to remote learning,” spokeswoman Courtney Gidner wrote in an email.

“He is committed to working with the delegation to ensure Colorado’s colleges and universities are able to provide for their students (including vulnerable students who need emergency aid for food, shelter, et al.) and continue to provide research, and community- and education-focused services moving forward.”",None,428.0,33.5809,-87.9862

Questions or concerns can be directed to the County of Sonoma Public Health Division, Disease Control Unit at (707) 565-4567 .

• Washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds • Avoid touching your eyes and face • Cough or sneeze into your sleeved elbow • Stay home when ill • Get a flu shot, and it’s not too late this season

Local health officials urge practicing good hygiene to reduce the risk of becoming infected with a respiratory virus, such as the flu or coronavirus. This includes:

Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital issued quarantine orders this week to at least 30 of its hospital workers who had contact with a patient with the coronavirus, the largest isolation order publicly reported so far at a single health care facility treating patients with the infectious disease in California, the union representing most front-line hospital staff said Thursday.

The union revealed the quarantine the same day Sonoma County public health officials announced a second confirmed case of COVID-19 from a local resident seeking care at an undisclosed Santa Rosa hospital. Both people traveled on a February round-trip cruise on the Grand Princess ship from San Francisco to Mexico and returned home on a shuttle from the port to Sonoma County, public health officials said.

Sutter officials would not say if the patient who exposed the hospital workers to the coronavirus was either of two cruise ship passengers who are local residents being treated in isolation at a Santa Rosa hospital, or a third passenger from another ship, the Diamond Princess, transferred in February to a local hospital from Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.

The union issued a statement urging hospitals to protect their workers.

“The workers aren’t being tested before being sent home,” said Sean Wherley, spokesman with SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. “They’re sent home but they are potentially exposing their families. It’s not clear how this is limiting the spread.”

Sutter executives would not confirm Thursday that employees had been sent home and declined to answer a reporter’s questions, instead issuing a prepared statement through a spokeswoman.

“The safety of our patients and employees” is top priority, the spokeswoman said. The hospital continues to update our protocols regarding the coronavirus “in accordance with best practices established by federal, state and local authorities.”

The employees under isolation in the state come from a wide range of positions within the hospitals, “anyone from the housekeeper coming into the room without being advised, the phlebotomist drawing the blood, the admitting clerk who was a first point of contact,” Wherley said.

The union pressed hospitals to develop better communication lines between executives and staff, establish early assessment protocols and ensure facilities have sufficient protective equipment and enough staff on duty.

Statewide, the union estimated at least 50 caregivers had been sent home from jobs at hospitals after they treated or came into contact with patients infected with COVID-19. At least 10 health care workers were taken off the job Feb. 27 at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View and Los Gatos.

Another 10 workers were isolated Wednesday from Kaiser Permanente in Roseville, where a man who died from the disease had been under care for six days.

Two workers from Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles were quarantined Tuesday.

Wherley, whose union represents 365 workers at Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital, said he had no details about the circumstances of the quarantine in Santa Rosa.

“Hospital executives need to collaborate with employees to understand the circumstances: are there supplies in place? What’s the protocol?” Wherley said. “Workers need to be trained before a patient comes in.”

AIDEA’s leaders called the meeting to approve a series of economic-aid measures intended to address the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Board member Al Fogle said the funding for the Ambler Road project was put on the emergency agenda in an attempt to start work this summer.

“We’re going to create 100-200 jobs immediately that otherwise would have gone to waste and been postponed to 2021,” he said.

Any work is contingent upon financial support from one or more of the mines that would use the road.

“We can do this. We can deploy the money. We can get people out working,” said Mark Davis, AIDEA’s chief infrastructure investment officer.

The proposed 200-mile industrial road would access a large, undeveloped copper-zinc mineral belt in Northwest Alaska. Conservation groups and some who live in the region have criticized the project as costly and a potential threat to subsistence resources and the region’s rivers.

Dozens of Alaskans called into the meeting to protest the road funding’s inclusion on the agenda. They accused the board of taking advantage of an emergency to bypass the normal public process.

“It is unacceptable that AIDEA used a global pandemic to funnel money” to the road, said Loren Karro of Palmer.

“Support things that would sustain the residents of Alaska, not Outside mining interests,” said Zoe Fuller, also of Palmer.

The Ambler Road issue overshadowed the board’s other work, which included a measure that waives its normal loan-granting procedures and another that immediately provides $50 million to underwrite small loans issued to Alaska businesses by Alaska banks.

Those loans will be available to businesses that already have loans from Alaska banks. Under the AIDEA plan, businesses can ask for additional cash from their bank to cover immediate expenses. In return, AIDEA will shoulder the risk.

“We’re not going to lend irresponsibly to them,” said Butch Olmstead of FirstBank and the Alaska Bankers Association.

Board members voted to ask the Alaska Legislature for permission to expand the plan to as much as $1 billion. Several legislators said that permission was unlikely because they are planning to leave Juneau within days.

In related business, the board approved loan relief for BlueCrest Energy, an oil company, and the Blood Bank of Alaska. The blood bank will not have to make payments on an existing loan for six months. The blood bank had requested a nine-month hold and an additional $2.5 million that was not granted. BlueCrest’s request was granted in full: It will have to make only interest payments for a year.

Tom Boutin, AIDEA’s executive director, said Alaskans “should conclude that this board treats every dollar as very, very precious.”

Board member Bernie Karl owns Chena Hot Springs Resort and said he has already been forced to lay off his staff.

“When the public tells us how devastating things are, I had to live that,” he said.

He said Alaskans should expect economic trouble for long after the public health crisis.

“This recovery is not going to be six months. It’s not going to be a year. It’s going to be several years for this recovery,” he said.",None,263.0,67.0897,-157.8725

One of the infected, a patient at the Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage, who was being seen for an unrelated issue, tested positive for COVID-19 and died four days later.

That death marked the first COVID-19 related death in Alaska. Another Alaskan, from Petersburg died of COVID-19 a few days ago in Washington state.

As of Friday, March 27, which was also the 56th anniversary of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake, the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services confirmed that there were 85 people in the state who had tested positive for the virus, most of them self-quarantined outside of hospitals. The list included Anchorage and Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson 39, Fairbanks 13 Ketchikan 12, North Pole 6, Juneau 4 Eagle River/Chugiak 3, Palmer 3, Sterling 2, and 1 each in Homer, Seward and Soldotna. Girdwood was the only area not previously reporting infections.

State and local government officials have already admonished all Alaskans to do their part by washing hands frequently, keeping hands off of the face, keeping a minimal six feet of space between themselves and others who are not immediate family and swiping down all frequently touched surfaces.

Also, in effect were statewide mandates for everyone entering Alaska, including residents coming home, to quarantine themselves for 14 days at home. Those battling respiratory infections, even with mild symptoms, are asked to isolate themselves from others and to call ahead if they need medical attention.

A growing number of rural communities were also imposing their own requirement for everyone entering their community to self-isolate for 14 days.

RavnAir confirmed that the carrier denied seats on a RavnAir flight headed for Bethel to two infants with suspected respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, a common respiratory infection among infants and toddlers in that region of Alaska.

A spokesperson for RavnAir said so far, their screening efforts have been successful “as we have prevented nearly 40 passengers who were either at risk or showing signs of illness from flying on our planes and putting others in harm’s way.”

Under their screening plan any passenger presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19 who does not have a doctor’s note is not allowed to fly on their planes.

RavnAir said that the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp. was notified that if they were willing to conduct an assessment via telemedicine and provide possible RSV patients or their parents/guardians with a doctor’s note explaining that the physician believed the passenger had RSV and not COVID-19 then the patient would be allowed to fly on RavnAir, as long as the patient had a mask on and did not fly on a normally scheduled flight with other passengers.

One of the new mandates announced on March 27 dictated that only those engaged in essential health care services, public government services and essential business activities are exempt from remaining at their place of residence and practicing social distancing. Everyone is urged to work from home as much as possible and cease participation in public or private gatherings that include non-household members. This includes, but is not limited to weddings, faith gatherings, graduations and funerals.

The second mandate dictates that all instate travel between communities, whether resident, worker or visitor, is prohibited unless travel is to support critical infrastructure or for critical personal needs. Some small communities may also implement further travel restrictions, the mandate noted.

Alaska legislators and federal officials were also working to provide financial aid to a multitude of people who found themselves suddenly out of work.

The pandemic’s impact on the economy and life overall in Alaska has been dramatic, the saving grace being that Alaska has huge areas where people can recreate while maintaining a great deal of distance between themselves and others while walking, hiking, ice skating, skiing and engaging in other outdoor activities. All that space is helping those with children home while all schools are closed to get outdoor exercise in a safe manner.

A number of businesses and other entities, from nonprofit entities to religious congregations, were restricting entry to or have closed their facilities, leaving them facing their regular rent space and utility bills with little or no income.

Gyms are closed. Many restaurants, coffee shops and other retail establishments are offering take-out or curb service only. Many companies that were counting on another lucrative summer tourism season are now telling workers hired for the season to stay home. Other businesses, including hair salons, where there is close interaction with customers, have been ordered closed. Many people employed in service industry jobs are now without jobs at least on a temporary basis.

Alaska Airlines announced plans to reduce its flight schedule for April and May by 70 percent following historic and unprecedented falloff in demand because of the pandemic.

Airline officials said flight schedules for June and beyond will be based on demand, but they expect reductions will be substantial for at least the next several months.",social_distance,2187.0,60.5348,-145.6092

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

TOP OF THE HOUR:

Senate unanimously passes $2 trillion economic stimulus package

Alaska Airlines to reduce flights by 70%, cut pay to its CEO and president to zero

South Korea has 104 new coronavirus cases, 5 more deaths

Trinidad & Tobago reports first death from virus

Spain extends its state of emergency by 2 weeks until April 11

China reports 67 new cases, all in recent arrivals from abroad

WASHINGTON —In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Senate on Wednesday passed a $2 trillion economic stimulus package —the largest ever —designed to pump money directly into Americans’ pockets while also shoring up hospitals, businesses and state and local governments struggling against the coronavirus pandemic.

The $2 trillion price tag is equal to more than half of the $3.5 trillion the federal government expects to collect in taxes this year, and is 9% of the nation’s gross domestic product.

“It’s going to take care of people,” President Donald Trump said of the legislation during a news conference, vowing to sign the bill immediately when it reaches his desk.

A vote was initially delayed in part by concerns from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a handful of Republican senators that laid-off low-wage earners in some states might be able to temporarily collect more from the expanded unemployment insurance in the bill than from their original salaries, creating a disincentive to work.

But Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin earlier Wednesday said most Americans would opt to keep their jobs, adding that the provision was needed to streamline the process of getting aid to workers nationwide.

“Our expectation is this bill passes tonight,” said Mnuchin, who took part in five days of tense, marathon negotiations between congressional Democrats and Senate Republicans.

The sweeping package will impact a broad swath of American society, with some elements potentially lasting longer than the health crisis.

Along with providing a one-time direct payout of up to $1,200 for most American adults, the bill includes $500 billion in loans to struggling businesses, $377 billion in loans and grants for small businesses, $150 billion for local, state and tribal governments struggling with a drop in revenue and $130 billion for hospitals.

The package also blocks foreclosures and evictions during the crisis on properties where the federal government backs the mortgage; pauses federal student loan payments for six months and waives the interest; gives states millions of dollars to begin offering mail or early voting; and provides more than $25 billion in new money for food assistance programs such as SNAP.

The real test will be whether the House accepts the bill as it is, and can pass it with “unanimous consent,” a procedure usually reserved for small, noncontroversial bills. If a single member comes to the House floor and objects, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may have to recall House members to Washington for a vote that would draw out the process.

Democratic and Republican House leaders are hoping to avoid that, but it remains to be seen whether they can. A House vote is scheduled to occur Friday.

Alaska airlines chops flights; CEO and president to receive no pay

SEATTLE — Alaska Airlines will reduce flights by 70% in April and May and cut pay to its CEO and president to zero through September to conserve cash amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The Seattle-based airline said Wednesday that like other airlines they are seeing demand for flights drop by more than 80% and flight schedules for June and beyond will be based on demand.

“These actions are unprecedented, but these are truly unprecedented times,” Alaska CEO Brad Tilden said in a news release.

Additionally, Alaska plans to slash pay by 50% to the president of Horizon Air, and cut it by 20 to 30% for other executives. The company board also will not take their pay. The company has worked with the White House, The Treasury Department, and Congress on a $50 billion aid package for passenger airlines, Tilden said.

“As we more fully understand the impact of these provisions, we will add to our plans to manage through this change,” he said.

South Korea: 9,241 infections, 131 deaths

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 104 new cases of the coronavirus and five more deaths, bringing its totals to 9,241 infections and 131 deaths.

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention said Thursday that 30 of the new cases were linked to recent arrivals.

Health authorities have been scrambling to prevent the virus from re-entering as an increasing number of South Koreans return from Europe and the United States amid broadening outbreaks and suspended school years.

From Friday, the country will enforce 14-day quarantines on South Korean nationals and foreigners with long-term stay visas arriving from the United States. Similar measures have already been applied to passengers arriving from Europe.

South Korean Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun on Thursday ordered officials to employ a “no-tolerance” policy on those who disobey quarantines, saying that South Korean nationals would be sued and foreigners would be expelled.

First death in Trinidad

PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad — Trinidad & Tobago is reporting its first death from the coronavirus.

Health Minister Terrence Deyalsingh said late Wednesday that the patient was an elderly man with a pre-existing medical condition.

The twin-island nation of 1.4 million people has more than 50 confirmed cases. The oil- and gas-rich nation shuttered its borders earlier this week and has refused entry to everyone, including Trinidadians now stuck abroad.

Spain: State of emergency extended by two weeks

MADRID — Spain’s Parliament has voted in favour of the government’s request to extend the state of emergency by two weeks that has allowed it to apply a national lockdown in hopes of stemming its coronavirus outbreak.

The parliamentary endorsement will allow the government to extend the strict stay-at-home rules and business closings for a full month. The government declared a state of emergency on March 14. It will now last until April 11.

Spain’s government solicited the two-week extension after deaths and infections from the COVID-19 virus have skyrocketed in recent days. Spain 47,600 total cases. Its 3,434 deaths only trail Italy’s death toll as the hardest-hit countries in the world.

The parliament met with fewer than 50 of its 350 members in the chamber, with the rest voting from home to reduce the risk of contagion.

China says 67 new coronavirus infections, all from recent arrivals

BEIJING — China’s National Health Commission on Thursday reported 67 new COVID-19 cases, all of which it says were imported infections in recent arrivals from abroad.

Once again, there were no new cases reported in Wuhan, the central Chinese provincial capital where the coronavirus emerged in December.

After a months-long lockdown, Wuhan residents are allowed out of the city but cannot leave Hubei province until April 8. China has started lifting the last of the controls that confined tens of millions of people to their homes.

As outbreaks escalate in the United States and Europe, China’s ruling Communist Party has declared victory over the epidemic and is relaxing restrictions to revive the economy.

Two-month-old infant infected in DC

WASHINGTON — District of Columbia health officials announced 48 new positive infections from the coronavirus, including a 2-month-old boy, bringing the total up to 231.

Officials also announced Washington’s third death from the virus, a 75-year-old woman.

Officials in Washington have long predicted that infection numbers would spike as testing became more available. Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a state of emergency, shuttered all schools and ordered all non-essential businesses to close.

White House and Capitol tours have been cancelled and the National Zoo, Smithsonian museum network and Kennedy Center have closed. Police have blocked off dozens of streets, bridges and traffic circles to prevent crowds coming to see Washington’s signature blooming cherry blossom trees.

Pentagon soldier tests positive

WASHINGTON — A U.S. Marine has become the first person stationed at the Pentagon to test positive for coronavirus.

The Marine has been in isolation at home since March 13, when a member of his immediate family began to show symptoms. The Pentagon said his workspace has been cleaned and a contact investigation is underway.

Two other defence workers who had visited the Pentagon have tested positive, but they were not assigned to the building.

Colorado: Stay-at-home order issued

DENVER — Colorado Gov. Jared Polis is issuing a statewide stay-at-home order in an attempt to stem the rapid spread of the coronavirus.

Polis said he is taking this “extreme measure,” effective Thursday until April 11 because restrictions taken to date haven’t done enough to reduce the spread of the virus. People should only leave home when they absolutely must, he said, for grocery shopping, to seek medical care or to care for dependents. Polis’ order comes after six Colorado counties issued stay-at-home orders affecting nearly 3 million people.

More than 1,086 people in Colorado have tested positive for the virus and at least 20 people have died.

Pentagon restricts troop movement

WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has halted for 60 days the movement of US troops and Defence Department civilians overseas as a further measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The stoppage is expected to affect about 90,000 troops scheduled to deploy abroad or to return from abroad over the next two months. Some exceptions are allowed, and the order by Defence Secretary Mark Esper will not stop the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as called for in last month’s deal with the Taliban.

Clarification on NYC self-isolation order

WASHINGTON — The White House says New York residents who have left the metro area in recent days should self-isolate for 14 days, clarifying guidance announced Tuesday which had applied to anyone who had visited New York recently.

Dr. Deborah Birx issued the new guidance Wednesday from the White House press briefing room, saying it applied to “residents of the metro area that may have gone to second homes or other places to reside.”

She says: “We’ve asked all of them to carefully monitor their temperatures and self-isolate from the communities where they went just to ensure their own health and the health of their communities.”

The New York metro area is now the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., accounting for more than 50% of all new infections reported in recent days.

Virus prompts truces in Libya, Philippines, other international hot spots

UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is welcoming calls by some groups for an immediate ceasefire to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, and says he sees “a clear conscience emerging” that it’s time to concentrate on the war against COVID-19.

He pointed to communist guerrillas in the Philippines announcing a ceasefire from Thursday to April 15 in response to his appeal, and said he was encouraged to see a truce in Libya between the warring parties “holding with difficulties.”

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric also noted the humanitarian truce called for by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country’s northeast to deal with the virus. The group was allied with the United States in the fight against Islamic State extremists.

Guterres said at a humanitarian briefing Wednesday that the Palestinian Authority and Israel have also been able to work together on COVID-19, “even if we know the extreme division that exists politically between the two.”

He said U.N. envoys around the world are talking to warring parties about ceasefires and he expressed hope that “it will be possible in Yemen and Syria to make serious progress” to end fighting and tackle the coronavirus.

Apache Junction is restricting in-person visits at City Hall and encouraging residents to take advantage of the city's online services to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.

Starting Wednesday, the city is closing its ""public counters"" where residents can pay bills and submit building plans. The counters will be open for appointments only and for brief drop-off or pick-up business as needed. Residents can conduct business with the city online or by phone, the city said.

Residents who need to speak with someone at offices located inside City Hall, such as the city manager's office, finance, the clerk's office, development services or human resources, are asked to call ahead before visiting City Hall.

The police department and municipal court lobbies remain open. The Apache Junction Paws and Claws Care Center also remains open.

The city last Friday declared a state of emergency after announcing temporary closures of its library and other city facilities earlier in the week.

“We don’t want anyone to be alarmed,” Mayor Jeff Serdy said in a written release about the emergency declaration. “This just allows the city to access funds if there are federal funds that are allocated.”

Apache Junction is a community of more than 40,000 residents that crosses over from Maricopa County into Pinal County.

In addition to city closures, the Apache Junction Chamber of Commerce and Visitor Center is closed to the public and the Superstition Mountain Community Facilities District, which provides sewer service to the area, closed its administrative office on Tuesday.

What's closed and open in Apache Junction

The library is closed, but residents can continue to use online services.

The Apache Junction Multi-Generational Center closed indefinitely, and all city classes and fitness programs have been suspended through the end of the month.

The city has temporarily suspended senior programs, including in-person dining, at the multi-generational center. Meals will be supplied to seniors on a drive-thru basis and by delivery.

City-run special events are suspended through the end of March.

Refunds of registration fees or facility reservations and membership suspensions will be offered as requested.

The Apache Junction Water District issued a temporary moratorium on water service disconnections during the pandemic. It encourages residents who can make a payment to do so online, by mail or at one of the city's dropbox locations.

City crews will increase their cleaning schedule for public buildings and sanitize high-touch areas.

Buckeye is joining other metro Phoenix cities in declaring a state of emergency due to the spread of novel coronavirus.

Mayor Jackie Meck in a video statement on Wednesday said city officials are ""working around the clock to keep you safe in what is an extremely fluid situation.""

The rapidly growing city of some 80,000 people is southwest of Phoenix.

It's not yet clear if Meck will use his expanded power to close bars and restrict restaurants as Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego did Tuesday. Essential city services, such as public safety services and water, sewer and trash, will not be disrupted, Meck said.

Buckeye joins several other Valley cities in declaring emergencies. Flagstaff was the first Arizona city to do so on Monday.

The emergency proclamation ""allows the Mayor to direct the City Manager to take quick action in coordinating emergency operations to manage the spread of COVID-19 and have access to funding without convening a formal Council meeting,"" according to the city. ""It also lays the groundwork for Buckeye to be eligible for federal funding reimbursement in the future.""

Buckeye city closures

Buckeye on Thursday announced it will restrict public access to city buildings starting at 6 p.m.

Services for engineering, planning and zoning and building permits will still be available Monday through Thursday by making an appointment over the phone at 623-349-6200. Project meetings will be changed to conference calls.

Buckeye canceled its Tuesday City Council meeting. The council was expected to vote on an updated water resources master plan, which was aimed at giving city leaders potential solutions to its small water supply that has come under scrutiny.

The city's libraries are closed indefinitely, the city announced Monday. Book drops also are closed. Late fees will be waived and books will automatically be renewed.

City parks are still open but bathrooms are closed and water fountains are turned off.

Household hazardous waste drop-off is postponed until further notice. Residents can request a landfill certificate by emailing trashadmin@buckeyeaz.gov.

Buckeye’s emergency management staff is coordinating with county and state public health officials to ensure residents and city staff are protected and that there is minimal disruption to city operations.

The city has closed its recreation center and suspended all parks and recreation events until further notice.

Programs and events at the Buckeye Senior Center are canceled until further notice. Members can pick up their meals at the center or have it delivered to their homes. Medical transportation will continue as scheduled.

City officials postponed several events in late March and early April, including Ultra Man, Verrado’s Founders Day and Mayor Jackie Meck’s State of the City address.

Youth sports leagues are postponed until further notice.

City officials are evaluating other events and programs as it works to reduce exposures to large groups and between employees.

The customer service counters are open, but residents are encouraged to use the city’s online services to cut down on visits to City Hall.

Buckeye is creating a staffing contingency plan to ensure the city can operate with minimum staffing if employees become sick. They're also disinfecting common areas every few hours.

More information can be found on the city’s website.

Congress,AZ,03-25-2020 00:00,https://chamberbusinessnews.com/2020/03/25/congress-declares-world-war-iii-on-coronavirus/,Congress declares World War III on coronavirus,"The entire Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry team is working from home as we do our part to promote social distancing and flatten the curve. There’s been no downtime, however. My days are filled with back-to-back conference calls with elected officials, association colleagues, and business leaders, all of whom are doing their best to think creatively and nimbly about how best to prevent a total economic catastrophe during this global pandemic. Here’s a quick update:

Pass this bill. Now.

The United States Senate, after some unfortunate delays, has reached a deal on a $2 trillion relief package to spare the U.S. economy from even greater damage. I thank Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Sen. Martha McSally for their diligence to get a deal done and for their regular and consistent accessibility to Arizona’s job creators.

I know the dollar amount of the bill is stunning. But the response has to be proportionate to the size of the crisis.

Make no mistake: This bill is not a nice-to-have; it’s a must-have, especially if we’re going to prevent a total economic catastrophe.

For businesses with up to 500 employees, the bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) includes about $350 billion in loans that could become forgivable grants to support employer payrolls, mortgages, rents, utilities, paid sick or medical leave, insurance premiums, and other costs to keep a business running.

For mid- and large-sized companies tattooed by this downturn, like airlines, the bill includes direct economic relief totaling $500 billion through loans and loan guarantees.

The bill also includes $150 billion for the health care sector; $150 billion for state, local, and tribal governments; expanded unemployment benefits for displaced workers; direct cash support to Americans (up to $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 per couple, and $500 per child); $30 billion in emergency education funding; and other essential elements.

This bill is the legislative equivalent of declaring World War III on coronavirus.

Once the bill clears the Senate, we need the U.S. House to act fast. Thankfully, based on the regular conference calls the Chamber membership has been having with Arizona’s House members, our delegation is ready to move quickly and ensure that any final legislation is focused squarely on addressing the crisis at hand, and not using the bill to advance some other unrelated policy goals.

This bill will be one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the nation’s history. Now is not the time to dawdle.

Legislature comes together

No one could have guessed back in January that the second session of the 54th Legislature would come to such an abrupt halt. But in the face of a public health emergency, legislative leaders in both parties did the right thing in passing a conservative budget for fiscal year 2021 and closing, at least temporarily, the session.

Legislators have plenty of bills that were sidelined by the quick wrap-up, as well as items that they would have liked to have been included in a budget. The Chamber, along with advocates on behalf of a host of other interests, is in the same boat. There’s always next year, though. Now’s the time to batten down the hatches.

The Chamber thanks each legislator for reaching a budget agreement, for passing a $55 million COVID-19 relief package, for passing with bipartisan support a bill to ensure Arizona leverages federal health care dollars (the bill, H.B. 2668, was signed by Gov. Ducey on Wednesday) and for ensuring the Legislature has the ability to reconvene the session to adjust to new revenue data or to adopt new public-health-related policies, and even to do so remotely if necessary.

Greater certainty now to avoid confusion later

Gov. Doug Ducey deserves credit for issuing an Executive Order that proactively establishes a clear, statewide policy on “essential” services and operations. With this policy in place, businesses and workers alike can proceed with assurance that they won’t have to navigate a patchwork of policies across the state if efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 have to escalate. The Executive Order takes responsible steps to safeguard the public’s health while doing all we can to ensure the Arizona economy continues to function. It’s a model approach that ensures there is no interruption to essential operations, including to manufacturing and supply chains that are critically important to ensuring store shelves stay stocked and critical parts and supplies get to where they need to go.

Regulatory relief when it’s needed most

It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the Ducey administration has been nimble in ensuring that efforts to protect the public’s health and the economy don’t get tied up in red tape. Regulatory rollbacks have been a theme throughout his entire tenure.

New rules, for example, allowing alcohol to be ordered with food delivery purchases might seem like a small thing, but for the thousands of restaurant and bar employees across the state who’ve been sidelined by this virus, it could be the difference between survival and collapse.

The governor also deserves credit for quickly securing approval from the federal government to expand access to medical care for the state’s AHCCCS population, and for moving to exempt certified registered nurse anesthetists from certain regulations.

The federal government has extended some smart regulatory relief, as well. Credit to the Department of Transportation for waiving the hours of service rules on commercial truck drivers aiding relief efforts, and for extending commercial driver’s licenses that are up for renewal during this crisis. If the trucks aren’t rolling, then the nation will suffer even more.

As someone who just extracted two kids from an unplanned extended spring break in Los Angeles, I can tell you the freeways there were eerily light on traffic, but the truckers were—and are—still on the job.

The Guadalupe Town Council on Thursday unanimously approved a state of emergency.

The declaration, which went into effect immediately, allows Mayor Valeria Molina to take emergency action if conditions due to COVID-19 worsen.

Actions include imposing a curfew or ordering businesses to close. The mayor has not yet exercised her expanded powers.

Cities across metro Phoenix, from Buckeye to Gilbert, have enacted similar emergency declarations in response to rising concerns about the coronavirus.

Guadalupe closed its senior center until the end of the month and made operational changes to mitigate the spread of the virus. To-go lunches will be provided to seniors through March 27.

As of March 20, the outbreak had infected more than 265,000 people and killed more than 11,000 people globally, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University.

The number of presumptive positive and confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Arizona hit 47 on Thursday.

Guadalupe events canceled through May

Town officials have canceled or postponed events with 50 or more people for the next eight weeks.

No party permits will be issued until May 8 and the city is working to reschedule or issue refunds for existing events at the city-owned Mercado de Guadalupe.

Town officials are reviewing events related to “cuaresma” or Lent, a sacred holiday observed by residents in the town that ends April 9.

Guadalupe Library, which is operated by Maricopa County Library District, is closed through March 30.

Guadalupe Town Hall will remain open to the public and other services will continue but the town is taking precautions to reduce the spread of new coronavirus.

Town Council meetings will continue but public attendance will be limited, said Town Manager Jeff Kulaga.

Ten people total, including council and staff, will be allowed in the council chambers. Three council members will participate in Thursday’s meeting by phone.

The town will provide overflow space in the lobby for those who want to attend in person.

Independent Newsmedia/Arianna Grainey This is not a time for panic or fear. On the contrary, this is a time for preparation and precaution, and that is exactly what we are doing.” Jerry Bien-Willner, Paradise Valley Mayor

Editor's Note: This story has been updated to include more information from a press release about closures and restrictions within the town as well as closure of the post office.

Paradise Valley Mayor Jerry Bien-Willner has issued a proclamation of emergency to go along with the Town Council’s authorization of the creation of a public meeting plan for remote participation as part of the town’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Town Council gathered in a special meeting March 17 to unanimously approve efforts to provide means and methods to ensure remote participation in town meetings from body members and the public.

Furthermore, the town is taking several actions to curtail in-person services to better align with state, federal and local recommendations regarding COVID-19, according to a press release distributed after the meeting.

One of such is the closing of the post office at Town Hall per a March 18 decision from Town Manager Jill Keimach. Mailboxes are still available for residents to drop off mail with postage but full service won't be available and residents should go to the Hopi Substation at 8790 E. Via de Ventura in Scottsdale.

Mr. Bien-Willner said these efforts are aimed at keeping the public involved in town matters while allowing them to undertake safe practices regarding the spread of COVID-19.

He also said his declaration of emergency is not based on any information he has heard contrary to what federal and state officials are saying publicly, but rather the need to prepare.

“This is not a time for panic or fear,” he said during the meeting. “On the contrary, this is a time for preparation and precaution, and that is exactly what we are doing.”

With the town in a state of emergency, Mr. Bien-Willner said it would be in better position to receive emergency funds and assistance from federal, state and county sources. He learned this after a conversation with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s office, he said.

Secondly, the mayor said this declaration also allows him the ability to work in consultation with Ms. Keimach to establish the changing guidelines from federal health officials without having to go through meetings and procedures, which could slow response and “jeopardize health and safety.”

“I’m not a public health expert,” Mr. Bien-Willner said. “We [the town] don’t have a large public health team but we are very blessed that the state does and certainly the federal government’s Centers for Disease Control. All the best minds in the country are focused on this situation, in fact around the world, and we have a direct pipeline into those folks.

“We’re going to be following that advice so this gives us implementation authority to do the things that need to be done. We don’t expect any measures currently that are beyond the scope of what is being discussed publicly.”

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, which led Gov. Doug Ducey to declare a state of emergency in Arizona on the same day. Since that time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encouraged a nationwide halt of gatherings.

With these parameters in place, the town decided to follow suit, which led to a call of plans to conduct all town meetings electronically. The town will continue to post agendas online along with instructions on how to participate.

“I know we are all interested in leading by example and the best example we can set is to practice social distancing,” Mr. Bien-Willner said. “We would have done this already but we also have to follow the law and keep order. That’s another example that we set, that we don’t panic and we don’t become afraid. We go through our business and this is an order of business that we get this resolution in place.""

Town Attorney Andrew Miller said Ms. Keimach would take the lead on establishing the public meetings plan along with input from himself and Town Clerk Duncan Miller.

Andrew Miller said he believes the three of them can get the plan together quickly and publicize it to the public through the website and PV Alert.

Other actions the town is taking include closing Town Hall and the Public Works Building to the public but still have staff available as they work remotely.

The town says the police department will be fully operational but foot traffic in the department's building will be limited to the lobby. Furthermore, the town says via a release police will exercise COVID-19 best practices when responding to emergency calls.

The Municipal Court will remain open but will have limited in-person appearances. There will be 30- or 45-day continuances as well as telephonic appearance options for all court matters. The community room and police auditorium will also be closed until further notice.

The town will continue to follow the CDC and state on further developments and restrictions regarding COVID-19. Ms. Keimach will also work to make remote working provisions for town staff who don’t need to work in-person, allowing for limited public emergency health leave when the town deems it necessary.

“We are just hoping the public gets used to this very quickly and that through a lot of education, we’ll be adjusted to that quickly,” Andrew Miller said.

While not much discussion happened at the special meeting, Vice Mayor Julie Pace voiced her support for the measures and expressed confidence in Mr. Bien-Willner.

“It allows us to conduct the business of the town,” she said. “It allows you [Mr. Bien-Willner] to be the lead to make sure as things evolve, the mayor can jump in and make good decisions for all of us and work with the other mayors and individuals in the state as this is a serious issue that will hopefully pass soon.”",state_of_emergency,14293.0,33.5434,-111.9595

A total of 773 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Arizona on Saturday, March 28, according to the morning report from the Arizona Department of Health Services.That's a jump of 108 from yesterday's 665.There are now 120 confirmed cases in Pima County.The virus has killed 15 people in Arizona, including at four in Pima County—a woman in her 50s, a man in his 70s, a woman in her 80s and a man in his 80s. All had underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk.In Maricopa County, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has risen to 454 cases.Many Tucson businesses will be closing today after Mayor Regina Romero last night issued an order to shutter all non-essential businesses that are not protected from mandatory closure by Gov. Doug Ducey, who has said that Arizona needs to has consistent rules statewide. Romero’s order is effective through Friday, April 17.“After consulting with my colleagues on the City Council, the City Manager, City Attorney, medical professionals, small businesses, and other stakeholders, I have determined that these actions are necessary to protect public health,” Romero said. “Although these are painful decisions, we have a moral obligation to do what is in the best interest of our residents and protect public health.”Romero said she wished she could do more, but Ducey’s order—which allows grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants (via takeout and delivery), barber shops, beauty parlors, parks, golf courses and other “essential” businesses to remain open—limited how many businesses she could order closed. She asked Tucsonans to stay home and avoid necessary trips and urged Ducey to issue a statewide “stay-at-home” order. “In the absence of clear statewide direction, we are taking swift action at the local level to protect the health and well-being of Tucsonans,” Romero said. “We cannot afford to wait any longer; COVID-19 is not waiting and neither can we. If Gov. Ducey is unwilling to take decisive action at the state level, then he needs to untie the hands of local jurisdictions and allow us to make decisions that are best for our individual communities. This is particularly critical with respect to the operations of ‘personal hygiene’ and other services that conflict with CDC social distancing guidelines and could jeopardize public health.”Health and government officials have urged the public to avoid unnecessary trips and gatherings of more than 10 people. They warn that the extremely contagious virus is rapidly spreading in the community. Symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear, so people can pass COVID-19 without realizing they have been infected with it. Some people remain entirely asymptotic but are carriers.In Oro Valley, Mayor Joe Winfield extended closures of bars, gyms, theaters and other places where people gather through the end of the declared statewide emergency. As in other communities, restaurants remain open for take-out and delivery.In addition to extending that mandate, Winfield’s latest amendment also closed playgrounds, basketball courts, fenced dog parks and other amenities in the town and strongly urged personal hygiene businesses to close. He also suspended regulation on temporary signs to aid businesses that remain open.“The Town Council understands that this unprecedented situation is significantly impacting many of our local businesses,” said Winfield in a statement. “Suspending enforcement of the temporary sign code in our commercial corridors is one meaningful way we can try to help businesses that have modified operations to let our residents know they are open for business. I hope the community will continue to patronize these places, as appropriate, during this emergency.”The Pima County Board of Supervisors on Thursday voted 3-2 to extend its own emergency through Friday, April 10. Democratic Supervisors Richard Elías, Sharon Bronson and Ramón Valadez voted in favor, while Republican Supervisors Ally Miller and Steve Christy voted against the measure.On Friday, March 20, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman also announced a two-week extension on public school closures, to last until April 10.In the face of the spreading virus, Ducey has also halted to evictions for 120 days; ordered bars, gyms and theaters to be closed in any county with confirmed COVID-19 cases; halted all elective surgery to keep hospital beds available for COVID-19 patients; loosened regulations to make telemedicine more available and increase eligibility for AHCCCS, the state's Medicaid program; and activated the National Guard to assist in grocery stores as Arizonans clear the shelves.Arizona's schools remain closed at least through April 10. Schools are transitioning to online learning and districts across the region are delivering lunch and breakfast meals to kids via school buses or setting up central locations.Courts have rescheduled most hearings to avoid spreading the virus.COVID-19 symptoms typically occur two to 14 days after exposure, and include headache, fever, cough, and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. However, some cases of the virus are entirely asymptomatic. Practices to avoid infection include social distancing (of at least six feet), washing your hands, avoiding unnecessary trips and not touching your face. COVID-19 can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on stainless steel and plastic surfaces up to three days.If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, speak with a healthcare provider for medical advice. According to the CDC, people who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to recover at home. Stay at home and avoid public transportation, but stay in touch with your doctor. If you do leave your home, wear a facemask and clean your hands often. If you develop more severe symptoms (persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, bluish lips) get medical attention immediately. Your local health authorities will give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.",shelter_in_place,2513.0,32.8886,-109.8437

SHONTO, Ariz.

The Shonto Preparatory School tenants and staff were ordered to shelter in place today after a tenant tested positive for COVID-19.

SPS administration on Saturday afternoon informed staff and tenants in a memo that a tenant who resides on the SPS campus had tested positive for the novel coronavirus at Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation.

“Therefore, we will issue a shelter in place for all tenants who reside on the SPS compound beginning immediately,” said Ronald Thompson, superintendent for SPS.

Thompson wrote in the memo, that has not gone public, that an incident command and authorities have been notified.

“Staff, students, family takes refuge at home and begins isolating themselves from the public,” Thompson wrote in the memo regarding the rule to curb the COVID-19 outbreak. “Do not travel. Stay at home.

“Sanitize areas at home, sanitize hands with (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) requirements,” he said. “All persons must remain in safe areas at home and keep isolated/distance away from the public until (an) incident commander (or) emergency responder gives an all clear/safe notification.”

Thompson added that the SPS administration will begin sanitizing and disinfecting all areas of the school.

Calls to Thompson went unanswered. A request for comment to the SPS Governing Board also went unanswered.

Surprise Mayor Skip Hall declared a local emergency on Thursday morning, which will allow the city to act quickly to control the spread of the new coronavirus.

“My top concern is protecting the health and safety of our employees, residents, and visitors,” Hall said in a written statement. “This proclamation is an important step that gives our City Manager the authority to respond quickly during this rapidly changing time.”

The declaration urges businesses to practice social distancing and places of worship to limit gatherings on their campuses.

Surprise is the latest in a long list of Arizona cities, from Buckeye to Gilbert, to declare an emergency.

Surprise has also shut down city programs and banned the public from attending City Council meetings in person.

On March 24, the city also shut down park amenities such as playgrounds.

City may take other measures

Surprise Mayor Skip Hall on Tuesday afternoon said city officials are considering what other measures they should take to protect the public in the city of some 135,000 residents northwest of Phoenix.

Hall said some are saying that declaring an emergency will make it easier for cities to recover money spent on fighting the outbreak, but he hasn’t been able to confirm that yet.

The local emergency gives the city manager the authority to take actions such as closing public buildings, limiting operating hours at city public buildings and places and canceling city events, programs and classes.

It also authorizes the city manager to seek financial and other forms of aid from federal, state and county authorities.

Tempe City Council declared a citywide emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19 during a special council meeting on Wednesday, March 18.

The Tempe City Charter allows this action, but the city has never used it in response to a public health emergency. Now that the ordinance is approved, Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell may ""enact necessary emergency response measures via proclamation during the duration of an emergency.""

“The Council moved forward on the emergency declaration in the event that further action is needed,” Mitchell said. “Any action taken would be done after thoughtful deliberation and would be in line with the recommendations of state and federal agencies for the safety of the residents of Tempe and the public at large. Stemming the spread of COVID-19 or coronavirus is our highest priority.”

In response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the emergency declarations of the state and federal governments, the Tempe City Council declared an extraordinary local emergency citywide. #tempeaz #ourtempe #stopthespread #coronavirushttps://t.co/8xsaGx71h4 pic.twitter.com/KFjbL6Ae3x — City of Tempe, AZ (@Tempegov) March 18, 2020

Mitchell has yet to enact a proclamation, but he could use one to close down bars, restaurants and more during the emergency. While a few Tempe bars have closed since health officials released new recommendations for coronavirus, some remain open.

Mitchell issued a statement Wednesday clarifying that he has ""not ordered the closure of bars or the transition of restaurants to drive-through or curbside pickup.""

However, he said that dining in ""any establishments"" is discouraged at this time, and also urged residents to ""stay home as much as possible and try to physically distance yourself from others if you do have to go out.""

Mitchell could also impose curfews or request aid from law enforcement agencies.

The decision comes one day after Mayor Kate Gallego of Phoenix declared a state of emergency in the city earlier this week, ordering the closure of bars and the conversion of restaurants to offer takeout, delivery and drive-thru options only.

Gilbert, Mesa and Buckeye have also declared states of emergency throughout the week.

The public was not allowed in-person access to this morning's meeting, but the meeting was streamed live on the internet and Tempe Channel 11. Members of the public were able to submit questions before and during the meeting via email.

The council originally intended to decide on this action during a special council meeting slated for March 19, but they chose to hold a separate meeting a day earlier. The previously scheduled special council meeting will still be held tomorrow to address different agenda items.

A Tolleson city employee tested positive for COVID-19, the city announced on Twitter.

The employee does not live in Tolleson and has not been at any city facilities for the last 28 days, according to the tweet. The city was notified on Thursday that the employee tested positive.

There's no reason to believe the employee spread or contracted the virus at a city facility, the tweet says, but staff are disinfecting and sanitizing work areas.

Gov. Doug Ducey on Thursday ordered restaurants to only offer takeout and delivery options and ordered bars, theaters and gyms to close in each county with confirmed cases.

Ducey authorized restaurants to deliver alcoholic drinks with food deliveries, halted all elective surgeries and allowed manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers to buy back unopened products from restaurants, bars and clubs. He also called on the National Guard to help grocery stores and food banks restock.

Even ahead of Ducey's action, Tolleson leaders had joined a growing list of metro Phoenix cities declaring emergencies and shuttered those businesses to curb the spread of novel coronavirus.

""The health and welfare of our community are of the utmost concern,"" said Anna Tovar, mayor of the city of just more than 7,000 residents west of Phoenix.

The city's emergency proclamation also closes:

All city parks.

Concert and entertainment venues.

Recreation centers and athletic fields.

The City Senior Center and library.

Grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants that only serve to-go orders, pharmacies, food banks, cafeterias inside hospitals or places of worship are all exempt from the emergency closures.

Tusayan,AZ,03-19-2020 00:00,https://www.williamsnews.com/news/2020/mar/19/tusayan-approves-25000-aid-residents-affected-econ/,"Tusayan approves $25,000 to aid residents affected by economic shortages amid COVID-19 shutdowns","TUSAYAN, Ariz. – The Tusayan Town Council held a special meeting March 18 to address immediate threats to Tusayan town residents and non-salaried employees extending to the Valle area who might be affected by closures and restrictions related to COVID-19 precautions.

Currently, there have been no documented cases of the infection in the community, however strident measures have been taken by businesses citywide to prevent possible transmission, as park visitors continue to arrive.

As of March 16, businesses throughout Tusayan began to restrict or remove access to heavily-trafficked places such as restaurant dining rooms, buffets and other vulnerable areas, which in turn caused many non-salaried employees to be without available work options indefinitely, and essentially suffering immediate loss of income. As resources and access are becoming more limited, residents are now faced with the dilemma of how to provide for themselves as well as their families. Even during normal circumstances, it is not always easy for residents of Tusayan to obtain needed items, as many do not own vehicles and shuttle services are limited to specified days and times.

Additionally, persons and families in need of extra assistance are usually able to receive supplemental food supplies every third Wednesday of the month through the Tusayan Food Bank. However, the Food Bank has faced extreme shortages since the restrictions have been in place, and are currently unable to obtain supplies, especially personal hygiene items, quickly enough to keep up with the recent increase in demand.

To combat these issues, Tusayan Council passed a motion to authorize Town Manager Cynthia Seelhammer to spend a maximum of $25,000 in collaboration with non-profits, charities and other public agencies to ensure the well-being of residents during this unprecedented economic situation.

This would include expenditures on food and hygiene items, transportation assistance, which may include gas vouchers for workers that own vehicles, and delivery services to persons in need due to the suspension of shuttle services into the park.

Testing options limited

There is also the matter of limited access to COVID-19 testing options for residents.

Currently, North Country Healthcare has two locations in Flagstaff offering limited testing, as federal restrictions are still in place regarding who is considered eligible to receive tests.

The Grand Canyon Clinic is a branch of the North Country Healthcare system, however the clinic has yet to receive any test kits. This point was considered by councilmembers to be of extreme concern as cases of infection continue to increase statewide, with one presumed case in Coconino County thus far.

In response, the council passed a motion to direct town staff to take necessary action to designate the Town Hall as a Point of Dispensing (POD) for the County Health Department once testing options become available. It was determined that it would be essential for testing to be provided in town as soon as possible, as so many residents face transportation issues.

Currently, individuals interested in testing are being advised to call testing centers beforehand in order to ensure eligibility, and are encouraged to not seek out rides from others to avoid potential exposure. There are currently no private/in-house testing options for residents, and the use of ambulances for transport to testing centers is strongly discouraged, due to cost and availability issues.

The town council is currently drafting a pre-emptive Declaration of Emergency to address the financial impact of the COVID-19 related precautions, in order to allow access to the town’s $9 million in savings, should such a measure be deemed necessary. As current state-imposed limits are not enough to provide assistance to the community at this level of need, accessing these funds would allow the town to ensure residents’ utilities, wellness and food needs will continue to be met as the situation continues to impact the community indefinitely.

Yuma County issues declaration of emergency on COVID-19.

Yuma County has officially issued a declaration of emergency over COVID-19. Yuma County Supervisor Board Chairman Tony Reyes says board members approved the declaration this morning. Reyes says the Board’s decision was made as a proactive reaction to a serious public health threat.

""We’re trying to get ahead of this to be able to assure the public that the county and the department, the health department of the county, and every employee of the county is ready to take care of our residents, of our public,"" Reyes said Friday. ""And we want to make sure, if need be, and actions need to be taken that are drastic, we’ll be able to do that.""

Diana Gomez, director of the Yuma County Public Health Services District, assured the public that even though an emergency declaration has been made, there is no reason for anyone to panic.

""As of this moment, and it’s a rapidly evolving situation, there is no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Yuma County,"" Gomez said. ""When we become aware of a confirmed case we will notify the public.""

Gomez added that at this time there are also no “presumed cases” of COVID-19. She said a presumed case is when someone is believed to be showing symptoms of the virus, but test results have not yet confirmed it.

Gomez says that as testing becomes readily available, more cases will be discovered. She says that does not mean there is more disease in the county, but rather that more people infected are being discovered.

Officials reiterated that the best thing people can do to protect themselves is to wash their hands often and stay away from situations where they can be exposed.

They are begging for support as they shift into this new phase.

Those that did it right away say, it isn't as easy as you might think.

""It's a complete pivot of your business model-to-go boxes and ramekins and these things,"" said Kevin Hamilton, owner of Canyon Club Brewery in Moraga. ""For awhile, we only had one phone line so people couldn't get through. The staff's job is suddenly completely different. The first couple days were nightmares. We got better everyday. A week in, we are good,"" he said.

Tosca in San Francisco, Vanessa's in Walnut Creek and Social Bird in Lafayette, among others, are just starting to offer this service. Hamilton encourages people to support them and worries about restaurants that aren't shifting to the new model.

""A lot places said 'We can't' and just stopped. We're not really making any money on it truthfully. I can pay eight people a night. I can give money to our vendors because they are really feeling this times 200,"" he said.

Hamilton and others who are trying this new model say they need your support more than ever right now. As you head into the weekend, they are asking that you consider your favorite local spot.

""Support your local person. Buy a gift card. Buy a t-shirt, a hat, to-go food. It helps,"" he said.

Hamilton was on his way Friday to pick up aluminum cans from another brewery that is close to closing its doors, realizing it isn't going to make it through this shut down.

""Be kind, be patient. Sometimes it might take a couple of phone calls to get through and your order may be wrong. Stick with us, we will all get through it,"" he said, laughing.

In a sign of optimism, Canyon Club is using this time to build a new outdoor bar. Management is expecting, and hoping for, a surge of people when they are finally allowed to leave their homes.

Between the hours of 9:00 pm and 5:00 am, all non-essential travel will be prohibited.

There will also be a curfew for youth under the age of eighteen from 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. for which the same exemptions as above will apply. “The school children should stay inside unless accompanied by an adult. We want parents to make sure they are using this time constructively,” Pine Bluff Mayor Shirley Washington said.

Based on projections from public health officials and the Governor, the COVID-19 pandemic may worsen in the next few weeks if social distancing guidelines are not followed. Public gatherings of 10 people or more have been prohibited by the Governor until further notice. The Pine Bluff Police Department will strictly enforce this order throughout the community. This order remains in effect even outside of local curfew hours. Non-essential businesses, restaurants, organizations, and faith organizations are encouraged to follow this directive.

Mayor Washington stated, “A lot of COVID-19 tests are being administered, and most of our tests are coming back negative. However, numbers can change drastically overnight. Therefore, we want to be as aggressively proactive as we can.”

On March 27, 2020, a federal judge ordered that he and another immigrant be released from the Adelanto Detention Facility over COVID-19 concerns. (Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)

A federal judge Friday ordered the release of two immigrants from a detention center in San Bernardino County where he said conditions have put them at risk of contracting coronavirus.

In an emergency temporary restraining order, Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. wrote that Pedro Bravo Castillo and Luis Vasquez Rueda should be freed “forthwith and without delay.”

“This is an unprecedented time in our nation’s history, filled with uncertainty, fear, and anxiety,” Hatter wrote. “But in the time of a crisis, our response to those at particularly high risk must be with compassion and not apathy.”

“The Government cannot act with a callous disregard for the safety of our fellow human beings,” he wrote.

Both residents of Los Angeles County, Castillo and Rueda were detained by Immigration Customs and Enforcement on March 16 and 17, respectively, according to court filings. At the time, widespread restrictions over COVID-19 were already in place across California, from shuttered businesses to the closures of schools serving millions.

On Wednesday, the men filed a complaint alleging the federal government violated their rights to due process by subjecting them to risks of contracting coronavirus, which has infected more than 100,000 nationwide.

ICE did not immediately respond to calls and an emailed request for comment.

“The public has a critical interest in preventing the further spread of the coronavirus,” Hatter wrote, indicating an outbreak at the Adelanto facility would “endanger all of us.”

Amid the ongoing pandemic, dozens of advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have called for the release of migrants at detention facilities and inmates in crowded jails. In Los Angeles County, the sheriff has said at least 1,700 inmates have been released over virus concerns.

The complaint filed in federal court indicates 58-year-old Castillo has had kidney stones, a hernia and other chronic health issues, and it describes ICE officers holding him “in several enclosed spaces — a car, a van, small rooms.”

Rueda, 23, entered the U.S. illegally when he was 5 years old and attended college as a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, according to court filings.

“During his arrest and transport, officers touched him and breathed on him without using masks and confined him in a crowded van with seven other arrestees for an hour and a half,” the complaint states.

At the Adelanto facility, Rueda was was placed in a dormitory already under quarantine, court filings state. When he was arrested, he had a work injury that “left him with bruises and bleeding in his eye, which may require surgery,” according to the complaint.

But he has been unable to get medical care at the detention center, which a federal watchdog report once blasted for poor living conditions such as inadequate medical care, nooses found in cells and detainees placed in “handcuffs and shackles” when they shouldn’t be.

Castillo, 58, and Rueda, 23, both have past DUI convictions for which they have served brief jail sentences.

Hatter rejected the federal government’s argument that they be kept in custody since no there are no confirmed cases at the Adelanto facility, noting the virus’ highly contagious nature and the possibility of asymptomatic carriers.

“They are not kept at least 6 feet apart from others at all times,” the judge wrote. “They have been put into a situation where they are forced to touch surfaces touched by other detainees, such as with common sinks, toilets and showers.”

Social visits have been discontinued due to risks of spreading COVID-19. A staff member at the facility said visiting hours are currently open only to attorneys.

While Castillo was detained, he expressed concerns about getting infected, according to a statement from the law firm that represented him and Rueda.

“I am afraid for my health. I worry that if we were to get sick in here, they still would not let us out and we would have to stay in here alone and sick,” Castillo said, according to the firm’s statement.",None,34066.0,34.5815,-117.4397

(VVNG.com) — The Adelanto City Council held an emergency meeting Thursday night to declare that a “local emergency exists,” and to confirm the limitation of public events.

Although no confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported in San Bernardino County, the council said they were taking proactive measures in response to the potential threat of COVID-19.

During the emergency meeting Thursday night, it was announced that the Adelanto Stadium, the community center, and the senior center will be closed until further notice to discourage public gatherings.

The day prior, on Wednesday March 11, the Council voted and approved that Mayor Pro Tem Gerardo Hernandez and City Manager Jessie Flores receive a budget of $1500 for an emergency trip to Sacramento to seek funding for the coronavirus.

“I’ll take that coronavirus risk and fly out to Sacramento as early as tonight, first thing Monday morning, whatever it takes to go out there and advocate on behalf of the City to secure some of these resources on a state level, and if I have to go to Washington D.C. to do the same, I will do that,” Flores stated during the Wednesday night meeting.

When asked how the funding would be spent, if approved, Flores said it would be used for a combination of medical care, and economic development opportunities.

As an example used, he said 3M, a company who makes face masks and hand sanitizer, was looking for cities where they can bring warehouses and provide supplies to the City.

Council member Joy Jeanette said “We may need truck loads of water coming into our city, toilet paper and baby supplies, and all this stuff, we need to be ready.”

Mayor Reyes told VVNG the council members were planning to leave on Monday but wasn’t so sure after receiving word that the Capital may be closing down. At this time it’s unknown when they will be leaving to Sacramento to “Lobby for Funds”.

Public health officials on Sunday announced five new cases of coronavirus in Northern California, including three new cases in Santa Clara County, and two health workers who were likely infected while exposed to a patient in Solano County.

The two Bay Area health care workers are ""presumptive positive"" with COVID-19 coronavirus, the Alameda County Health Department reported on Sunday. A presumptive positive case is a person who tested positive by a public health laboratory and is pending confirmatory testing at the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention.

Both patients are NorthBay VacaValley Hospital health care workers and are currently in isolation at home; one is a Solano County resident, the other is an Alameda County resident, according to health officials. Both also had exposure to the community-acquired case currently hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The woman in the initial case is slowly recovering, health officials said, and her family members had negative test results for COVID-19 so far and remain in quarantine.

“In her stay there of several days, there were many health care workers who came into contact with her,"" said Solano County Health Officer Dr. Bela Matyas. ""We were aware of that once we learned about her situation, North Bay hospital and public health officials very aggressively identified everyone who could have possibly had contact with her and then quarantined them.""

Maytas added the ""good news is that the ill health care workers, none of them are ill enough to require hospitalization.""

Public health and hospital staff said they quickly identified all health care workers in contact with the person during his or her hospitalization. All of those health care workers remain in isolation or in quarantine and will not return to patient care until they are cleared, the health department said.

The announcement also brought Santa Clara County’s total to seven cases of the new virus, known officially as novel coronavirus or COVID-19, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department said Sunday evening.

The fifth case involves an adult woman with chronic health conditions who was hospitalized. The sixth and seventh cases involve a husband and wife who recently traveled to Egypt. The husband has chronic health conditions, and the couple is currently hospitalized, according to the department.

“We understand that the evolving news about COVID-19 is concerning, and we are taking the situation very seriously. This news is not unexpected in the Bay Area, and we are ready for cases here. This is not the time to panic; now is the time for all of us to work together."" — Dr. Erica Pan, Health Officer, Alameda County Public Health Department.

A full contact investigation is underway for the two new health care worker cases, and individuals potentially exposed are in the process of being identified and evaluated.

Teams of epidemiologists from the CDC and California Department of Public Health are helping the health departments in tracing those who may be at risk for exposure because of the new cases.

Alameda County and Solano County Public Health Departments are monitoring these new cases’ conditions as well as their contacts for symptoms.

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have experienced mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Similar to the flu, it appears to cause less severe illness in younger people; those with more severe impacts tend to be older, medically fragile individuals with underlying medical conditions.

Health care organizations, government entities, schools and employers should plan now for how best to decrease the spread of illness and lower the impact of COVID-19.",state_of_emergency,79177.0,37.767,-122.2673

Alhambra’s City Council, meeting in special session, passed a resolution declaring a state of emergency in response to the COVID-19.

The Monday afternoon meeting came just hours after the L.A. County Department of Public Health provided a list of cases of the COVID-19 virus in communities with populations of over 25,000 in the County. Two of the newly announced cases are in the city of Alhambra. No further information on the cases was provided by the LACDPH.

Alhambra’s resolution was passed on a 4-0 vote and is effective immediately.

Mayor Ross J. Maza and Vice Mayor David Mejia attended the hurriedly called meeting in the Alhambra City Hall Conference Room with Councilmembers Adele Andrade-Stadler and Jeff Maloney joining by speaker phone. Councilmember Katherine Lee was unable to participate.

City officials in attendance included City Manager Jessica Binnquist, City Attorney Joseph Montes, Police Chief Timothy Vu, Fire Chief Thomas Phelps and City Clerk Lauren Myles.

The goal of the proclamation is to allow the city to strengthen efforts to seek assistance from state and federal partners in Alhambra’s efforts to deal with the coronavirus threat and new restrictions in response to that threat.

On Monday, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors and the Department of Public Health issued an order closing bars, nightclubs, gym, fitness centers, movie theaters, among other establishments, and prohibiting restaurant dining. This order would apply to businesses in Alhambra.

Along with passing the resolution, Alhambra announced that City Hall will remain open but officials encouraged residents to conduct necessary business online or by telephone at 626-570-5007. Public Safety operations will also remain open and available at 626-570-5151.

City parks and open areas will continue to remain open but pools and gymnasiums are closed. Park restrooms will be serviced and sanitized more frequently.

The customer service center for utility payments will remain open. Water and trash service operations will continue but customers are again urged to use online payment systems when possible. There will be no water shut-offs for 60 days.

Farmers Markets in Alhambra will remain open. Hand washing stations will be installed and vendors will be spaced farther apart to give shoppers room for social distancing. The decision to keep the markets open was made, officials said, to keep the food supply open at a time when standard markets are facing long lines and shortages.

The city also announced a number of closures or cancellations:

— All non-essential meetings and City events, and non-City meetings and events in City facilities are cancelled until further notice.

— The regular City Council meeting on March 23, 2020 has been cancelled. The next council meeting is scheduled for April 13. All other board and commission meetings are cancelled until further notice.

— Alhambra Civic Center Library is closed until further notice. Patrons may contact the library by phone for assistance with e-resource materials and can access digital resources through its website.

— The Joslyn Senior Center will close until further notice. Arrangements are currently being developed to provide nutritional support for those who participate in such programs at the center.

— Senior Ride Programs will continue as normal to provide for essential trips including grocery shopping and medical appointments.

—Recreation and community services will be curtailed. Facility reservations, adult and youth programs and classes are cancelled immediately until further notice.

On Friday, Alhambra Unified School District officials announced that schools would be dismissed for a two week period that started on Monday. That would be followed by a week of spring break. During the spring break week, district officials would re-assess the closure and determine whether to extend it or modify the order. The original plan for teachers and administrators to work from various campuses was modified Monday and they will now work from home.

The district was trying to maintain its noontime food service on a grab and go basis. Here is the schedule for lunch service.

The L.A. County Office of Education announced over the weekend that all school districts in the county will be closed for various lengths of time. For more information see their list of districts here.

In Monterey Park, City Hall was closed to the public beginning Monday. Regular hours of operation will continue and phone and email communications with city staffers and departments would remain available during that time. Normal online services would also continue to operate.

In addition all regular public meetings in Monterey Park, including city council meetings, are cancelled. Residents are urged to monitor the city’s website for updates on special meetings that may be called.

The city’s Bruggemeyer Library was ordered closed effective last Saturday and the facility reservation program, activity programs and classes are cancelled until further notice. More information may be obtained by calling 626-307-1388.

Special Events in Monterey Park including the weekly Farmer’s Market on Thursdays at George Elder Park, East Day Festival, Eco-Summit and Bike Rides at Barnes Park on April 25, the Cherry Blossom Festival at Barnes Park on April 25-26 are also cancelled.

Census 101 Informational Session, at Bruggemeyer Library on Saturday, March 21 is also cancelled.

Officials in San Gabriel were still working on their response to the coronavirus on Monday after already cancelling all major city events for the foreseeable future. The City also decided to cancel events where large groups of senior citizens or other at risk populations would likely be gathering.

At the Mission Playhouse, performances of Newsies by Temple City Performing Arts were cancelled last weekend and Silent Sundays at the Mission Playhouse schedule for March 22 has been postponed until further notice.

Senior lunch programs are being altered to give participants frozen meals that they can take home to prepare. This would replace the congregate meal system previously in place.

In an email to Alhambra Source, Jonathan Fu, the city’s public information officer, said that essential city public safety services would remain in effect but that non-essential services may be modified in the next few days. More information on the changes would be conveyed in the next few days, Fu’s e-mail stated, and he urged interested parties to check the city’s web site for updates.

We need your support to continue our important work. Please join your neighbors and become a subscribing member today

With the number coronavirus cases in the county steadily climbing, the city of Palo Alto on Thursday declared a state of emergency, joining a growing number of jurisdictions preparing for the impacts of the spreading pandemic.

The proclamation of the emergency by City Manager Ed Shikada comes days after the city canceled more than 30 events, including town halls and civic ceremonies, to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The city has already canceled most of its public meetings and planned ceremonies, consistent with Santa Clara County's recommendations to encourage ""social distancing.""

Shikada also introduced numerous measures on Thursday aimed to limit face-to-face customer service interaction between the public and staff, including encouraging residents to call, email or make appointments with staff (the full list of changes is available here).

Shikada emphasized in a statement that the city ""will continue to provide essential services and community support through thoughtful planning for several impact scenarios during this time of heightened public health risk.""

""This is a fast-changing situation, and service changes may continue to evolve,"" Shikada said in the announcement. ""We have already taken several steps to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, including limited public gatherings according to the public health department's guidance. ...""

The Thursday declaration, as well as the new measures, intend to provide Palo Alto with ""flexibility in how we can respond to this changing crisis,"" Mayor Adrian Fine announced Thursday. The emergency declaration, he said, will help Emergency Services personnel ""secure vital supplies, funding and assistance."" Emergency declarations allow local jurisdictions to activate their emergency plans and become eligible for reimbursements from federal and state governments.

Palo Alto is one of many jurisdictions declaring a state of emergency, which comes the same day that Mountain View made a similar move and a day after the city of Santa Clara made its declaration. San Francisco and Santa Clara County previously declared a state of emergency in their respective jurisdictions.

More than 20 states, including New York, California and Washington, had also announced a state of emergency to combat coronavirus.

Shikada also announced on Thursday a series of service changes, most of which will take effect on March 16. Rinconada Pool was closed as of Thursday, the temporary Junior Museum and Zoo was set to close on March 13, and all Children's Theatre performances were postponed until June. Local libraries are disabling some computers to ensure ""social distancing"" between users and Development Center will only be accessible by appointment.

The City has discontinued police public tours and police and fire ride-a-longs and sit-a-longs. Patrol operations are also being modified for non-emergency police calls for service that can be completed via phone or video. Officers plan to limit face-to-face public contact and ensure social distancing of six feet when possible.

Other services that are typically provided over the counter, including revenue collections, and Residential Parking Permit programs, will now be offered by appointment, as well as by phone, email and online. And residents looking to attend Monday's meeting of the City Council are encouraged to instead submit their comments via email (those should be sent to city.council@cityofpaloalto.org) and to watch the live broadcast of the meetings rather than appearing in-person.

Residents who still want to attend are asked to sit at least six feet away from other people, to avoid shaking hands and to wait until the podium is clear to speak.

Angels Camp, CA – Plans to formally declare a local emergency is at the top of the agenda for City of Angels council members.

The proclamation, which will be made due to the COVID-19 outbreak at the council’s next regular meeting on Tuesday, is not surprising since Calaveras County declared a local health emergency this past week one day after a briefing of the county supervisors by Public Health Officer Dr. Dean Kelaita, due to two confirmed Coronavirus cases in Copperopolis, as reported here. Such declarations provide a nexus for tapping funding to deal with impending local COVID-19 impacts.

Finance Officer Melissa Raggio, recently hired for the post, is slated to present the city’s midyear financial reports for the current fiscal year. City Administrator Melissa Eads will lead a presentation of accomplishments for the previous fiscal year augmented by department heads.

In other business, the council will preside over the swearing-in of new Police Officer Joseph Linayao and an interview of Planning Commissioner candidate Kristopher Kierkfor an appointment to a term ending June 30, 2021.

Tuesday’s meeting at Angels Firehouse (1404 Vallecito Road) begins with public comments at 5 p.m. followed by a closed session over real estate and labor negotiations and employee performance evaluations before reopening to the public at 6 p.m.",state_of_emergency,3723.0,38.0706,-120.5501

Proclamation No. 2020-01 allows the Town to enact its authority, under state law, to mobilize local resources, coordinate combined interagency support, accelerate procurement of vital supplies, use mutual aid, and seek future reimbursement by state and federal governments in order to respond to COVID-19.

Town Manager Doug Robertson, acting in his capacity as the Director of Emergency Services and in accordance with the Town’s Emergency Operations Plan, signed the declaration today.

“Due to the growing spread of the pneumonia-like coronavirus, and its threat to the community’s safety and public health, it is incumbent upon the Town to access all available resources to respond to this crisis,” said Robertson. “We are already seeing locally owned and managed restaurants and businesses close their doors due to quarantining measures. The economic consequences of the pandemic are already impacting Apple Valley families, entrepreneurs and workers.”

In addition, the declaration orders Town departments track costs associated with staffing, supplies, and equipment related to this emergency and to submit such information to the Town’s Finance Department on a regular basis during the course of the emergency.

The Town Council is expected to ratify the proclamation at its March 24 regular meeting.

In accordance with Governor Newsom’s Thursday evening order for all Californians to stay home, the Town strongly advocates for residents to social distance to help protect the health and safety of our Apple Valley friends and neighbors. Flattening the curve and heightened hygiene remain the only known medicine to slow the rapid spread of the coronavirus and avoid the overburdening of hospitals and health care professionals.

“The sooner and better we social distance and stay home, the healthier we will be as a community to fight this pandemic,” Robertson added.

The City Council will ratify the declaration within seven days.

“We have no diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in Benicia. Issuing a proclamation of local emergency follows actions already taken by the County of Solano and the State of California and positions the City of Benicia for possible reimbursement from the State and Federal agencies for costs incurred during this public health emergency,” said Tinfow. “Doing so also allows for greater management flexibility in issues associated with City employees as disaster service workers.”

“I know I speak for the entire City Council when I express our concern for the safety and well-being of our community members during this uncertain time, especially those most vulnerable among us,” said Mayor Elizabeth Patterson. “Our excellent City staff are taking necessary actions to protect the community. Council will ratify the declaration and do what we can to assist City staff in protecting everyone.”

BUSD extends school closure to April 10

From Superintendent Dr. Charles Young:

Dear Benicia parents and guardians,

In light of recent guidance from the State and Federal Government regarding Covid-19, the Benicia Unified School District is extending its school closure through April 10, which includes spring break. We are monitoring all of this daily and will continue to provide updates.

We deeply appreciate everyone’s patience and partnership during this critical time in world history.

I came across the following from one of my favorite authors Brene Brown:

“Fear and anxiety can drive us to become very self-focused. This global pandemic is a real case of ‘getting sick together’ or ‘staying well together.’ Our choices affect everyone around us. There is no such thing as ‘individual risk’ or ‘individual wellness.’

State ramps up response

Just this week, Gov. Gavin Newsom also issued a new executive order further enhancing California’s ability to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Governor’s order:

– Waives the one-week waiting period for people who are unemployed and/or disabled as a result of COVID-19;

– Delays the deadline for state tax filing by 60 days for individuals and businesses unable to file on time based on compliance with public health requirements related to COVID-19 filings;

– Directs residents to follow public health directives and guidance, including canceling large non-essential gatherings that do not meet state criteria;

– Readies the state to commandeer property for temporary residences and medical facilities for quarantining, isolating or treating individuals;

– Allows local or state legislative bodies to hold meetings via teleconference and to make meetings accessible electronically; and

– Allows local and state emergency administrators to act quickly to protect public health. State

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC's recommendations for using a facemask. CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

The Carson City Board of Supervisors declared a State of Emergency Thursday in order to deal with the coronavirus.

“There will probably come a time when we need to act quickly and it’s important for disaster relief and getting relief from the feds,” said Mayor Bob Crowell.

The declaration gives the city manager working in concert with the sheriff the authority to do a number of things, including impose a curfew or temporarily change codes and ordinances, said District Attorney Jason Woodbury.

“All powers are discretionary and do not have to be exercised,” said Woodbury.

The declaration is for two weeks and automatically renews each week for another week until the board or the governor ends it.

Supervisor Stacey Giomi, a former Carson City fire chief, said a state of emergency had been declared during the Waterfall Fire and several other times for flooding and snowstorms during his tenure.

“It says we need more resources to deal with this emergency,” said Giomi. “It’s not draconian.”

Fire Chief Sean Slamon said the city’s emergency operations center (EOC) has transitioned to a joint operation that includes personnel from Carson City and Douglas, Lyon and Storey counties.

He said 911 dispatchers are now asking questions pertaining to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, if the call warrants it and then sending responders out equipped with personal protective equipment — gowns, masks, and eye protection known as PPEs — to respond to those calls.

Jeanne Freeman with the EOC said a shipment of PPEs requested had arrived from the strategic national stockpile, but the State of Nevada had not received its entire request.

Freeman also said as more test kits for the virus become available, some medical groups will participate in testing while others said they do not want to take part due to a lack of PPEs.

Jim Freed, from Carson Tahoe Health, said the hospital is taking steps to conserve PPEs including limiting visits to intensive care unit patients as they await more supplies.

“The good news is most of the tests (for coronavirus) are coming back negative, we have not seen a huge influx, but that could change,” said Freed.

The board also voted to make some changes to city operations and to direct staff to investigate other ideas.

• There is now a hiring freeze for city personnel unless waived by the city manager to fill certain critical positions.

• Late fees and interest for non payment of water, sewer or stormwater bills are now suspended temporarily.

• Staff will look into new budget projections for revenue and return at the second meeting in April with possible scenarios. The current projection for the next fiscal year’s budget calls for 2.5 percent increase in revenues and staff will look at scenarios for a drop in revenue as much as 7.5 percent.

• City staff who can work at home are now working at home and non-essential hourly workers have been suspended, but some may be reassigned to essential positions, said Nancy Paulson, city manager.

• Staff is also going to look into conducting board meetings via teleconference or phone. A public room for the public to comment would still be set up as it is required by Nevada law.

• Staff is also looking at ways to provide information for the public, both online at the city’s web site and social media sites as well as possibly on message boards in public locations such as the library or outside City Hall.

The mayor thanked everyone for all the work they have put in and asked the community to stay in touch with neighbors and family.

“I think our community is well positioned,” said Crowell. “But these are not easy times and it’s not going to get any easier.”",state_of_emergency,92735.0,33.8374,-118.2559

Updated at 8:45 p.m. ET

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 11 people, after officials reported fatalities in California and Washington state on Wednesday. The most recent death is connected to a cruise ship that traveled from the U.S. to Mexico.

Officials in Placer County, Calif., announced that an elderly resident has become the first person to die from the illness in California. The patient, who was not identified, had underlying health conditions, according to the county.

The patient tested positive for the coronavirus illness on Tuesday and ""was likely exposed during international travel from Feb. 11-21 on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico,"" according to a statement published on Placer County's website.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Roughly a week passed from the end of the cruise to when the patient was hospitalized, officials say. An ambulance took the patient to a hospital on Feb. 27; in the interval, the person had ""minimal community exposure,"" the county says. The patient had been in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville.

Gov. Gavin Newsom extended his condolences to the patient's loved ones and said the state is working with federal agencies to trace people who might have had contact with the patient. Later Wednesday, Newsom declared a state of emergency over coronavirus in California, which has more than 50 confirmed cases, according to health officials.

Placer County spans a wide area, from the outskirts of Sacramento to Lake Tahoe.

Among California's cases are 24 people who arrived in the U.S. on repatriation flights from outbreak locations in Asia.

The other cases include seven people who were infected via person-to-person exposure and 12 travel-related cases.

""Approximately 515 persons have been tested to date,"" the California Department of Public Health says.

To prevent the virus from spreading, health experts recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer. Face masks should be worn only by people who are either sick or are caring for someone who is, according to the World Health Organization.

Washington state

Washington state raised its own death toll from COVID-19 to 10 people earlier Wednesday. The state now has 39 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease, with 31 of them in Seattle and King County. The other eight cases are in neighboring Snohomish County.

Many of the cases are linked to Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., the long-term care facility northeast of Seattle that is at the center of the outbreak in King County.

On Wednesday afternoon, officials in Seattle and King County issued recommendations for vulnerable residents to try to contain the spread of coronavirus in the area.

""People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others,"" they said in a statement.

That group includes people 60 and older; people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; those with weakened immune systems; and people who are pregnant.

In addition, officials said companies should take steps to allow employees to work from home, if possible, and recommended that people avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities and nursing homes.

More than 230 people in Washington state are under supervision out of concern that they may have been exposed to the pathogen, the Washington Department of Health says.

Los Angeles declares emergency

Hours before Gov. Newsom declared an emergency for the entire state, the city of Los Angeles declared a health emergency over the coronavirus, citing the need to address the possibility of community transmission of the disease that has caused more than 3,200 deaths globally.

The move comes after Los Angeles County confirmed six new cases of the coronavirus and seven overall, according to Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.

""I have signed a declaration of local emergency for the City of Los Angeles,"" Mayor Eric Garcetti announced via Facebook. ""While there are only a few known active COVID-19 cases in the region, the declaration helps us access state and federal funding to strengthen and support our efforts to prepare our region and keep our communities safe.""

Los Angeles County mirrored the city's move, in a step that the chair of the county's board of supervisors, Kathryn Barger, said was a planned reaction to the virus.

""This is not a response rooted in panic,"" Barger said, adding that the emergency declaration would help agencies coordinate their response and contain the virus in a county where more than 10 million people live.

One person has been hospitalized while five others are being monitored at home, Ferrer said. The county's first patient, a Chinese national who was diagnosed in January, has recovered from the virus, she said.

""Three of the new cases were travelers who were traveling together in northern Italy,"" Ferrer said at a news conference. Two others are relatives of a person who was infected with the coronavirus outside of the county, she said. The sixth case is a person who works in a field that exposes them to international travelers, Ferrer added.

Later Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that a worker at the city's international airport who screened incoming flights from China and nearby countries had tested positive for the virus.

Cases rise in U.S.

There are at least 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19 that originated in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier Wednesday. That number doesn't include the 49 Americans diagnosed with COVID-19 who have been repatriated from outbreaks in Wuhan, China, and aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

At least 13 states have reported coronavirus cases since late January.

While international travel has been linked to 24 of the U.S. cases, the cause of transmission is still under investigation in 40 cases. Person-to-person spread in the U.S. has caused infection in 16 cases, according to the CDC .

The CDC data reflects numbers that were reported by 4 p.m. ET the previous day — meaning the actual number of cases in the U.S. might be higher than the most recent posting by the agency.

""States are now testing and publicly reporting their cases,"" the CDC says. ""In the event of a discrepancy, state case counts are the most up to date.""

In addition to California and Washington, other states reporting coronavirus cases include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin.

Although Texas previously had cases from people returning from China or who had been aboard the Diamond Princess, officials on Wednesday reported a newly detected infection in a person who had recently traveled aboard.

""Having a COVID-19 case in Texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn't change the fact that the immediate risk to most Texans is low,"" said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. ""This travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting limit the spread of COVID-19 and all respiratory illnesses.""",state_of_emergency,167836.0,33.862,-117.5641
Corona,CA,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51740706,Coronavirus: California declares emergency after death,"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Pence outlines new measures to combat coronavirus

California has declared a state of emergency after announcing its first coronavirus death, bringing the US death toll from the disease to 11.

The 71-year-old man had underlying health conditions and had been on a cruise ship, said officials.

Eleven passengers and 10 crew members are potentially infected on board the Grand Princess now being held off the coast of California.

There are now at least 150 reported US patients with Covid-19 in 16 states.

Worldwide, authorities have confirmed more than 92,000 cases of the virus, of which more than 80,000 are in China.

More than 3,000 people have died globally, the vast majority in China where the virus originated.

Ten of the 11 US deaths were in Washington state.

Meanwhile Washington and Florida both declared states of emergency over the weekend to help prevent the coronavirus.

Such a declaration gives cities and counties the ability to ask the state or other municipalities for aid if and when their own resources are depleted. Officials have said that a state of emergency is meant to expedite the distribution of resources and should not be cause for panic.

What do I need to know about the coronavirus?

What do we know about the cruise ship?

It is believed that the deceased California man became infected aboard the Grand Princess, a cruise ship which made a round trip from San Francisco to Mexico last month.

After the ship docked in San Francisco on 21 February, thousands more passengers boarded and thousands disembarked. The vessel then began a round-trip to Hawaii.

Some 62 passengers were on both the Mexico and the Hawaii trips. They have been restricted to their rooms for testing.

The Coast Guard will deliver sampling kits to the ship by helicopter on Thursday and a medical team on board will administer the tests. Fewer than 100 passengers and crew have been identified for testing, Princess Cruises said in a statement.

Mark Pace and his wife Beth are on the ship and told CNN they are among passengers allowed to roam around. They said they had noticed some changes on board. In order to get a plate for the buffet, they have to wash their hands and use hand gel. They are also not allowed to serve themselves.

""We are a little nervous about it. We knew it was a possibility. We came prepared with two weeks of extra medication and my laptop so that I could work if we were confined,"" Mr Pace said.

The ship is operated by Carnival, whose Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined last month after dozens of passengers tested positive for Covid-19 as it docked in Japan.

What other action is the US taking?

The US government currently prohibits entry to foreign nationals who have visited China - the epicentre of the outbreak - during the past 14 days.

US Vice-President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that any American can be tested for the coronavirus if ordered by a doctor.

Mr Pence, who is leading the US outbreak response, also said that the White House will begin on-camera briefings on the virus.

In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will lift existing restrictions on tests and provide new guidelines for speeding up exams for those who fear they are infected.

But some question how this promise will be kept, as public health laboratories insist their capacity for processing the tests is restricted.

There is also a question of cost, amid reports of uninsured Americans paying upwards of $1,000 (£780) for a test. The US House of Representatives approved $8.3bn in emergency aid on Wednesday to combat the coronavirus.

Some health officials have accused the Trump administration of a slow-footed response to the outbreak, and concerns have been raised about a nationwide shortage of test kits.

In response, President Trump blamed the shortage on regulations adopted by his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama. The administration claims it has lifted these regulations by allowing local labs to create their own tests.

Outside of government, United Airlines and Delta have announced cuts to their US flight schedules due to a drop in demand caused by worries over the virus.

What are the latest developments elsewhere?

The worst-hit country outside China is South Korea, which on Wednesday reported 516 new confirmed infections, bringing the total to 5,766. The country's death toll stands at 35.

In an effort to curb the outbreak, South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun has announced a ban on face mask exports.

Australia has meanwhile banned entry for all foreign nationals from South Korea. Two people have died from coronavirus in Australia, and another 53 cases have been reported.

Meanwhile, China has reported 139 new cases and 31 deaths, all in Hubei province.

Schools have been closed for at least 10 days in Italy, which is grappling with the worst outbreak outside Asia.

On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund announced $50bn (£39bn) of support for countries hit by the coronavirus. The organisation also warned that global economic growth was now expected to be below the 2.9% rate for 2019.

— As the coronavirus pandemic continues to grow with new cases reported every day, Costa Mesa City Manager Lori Ann Farrell Harrison Thursday declared a local emergency.

“Based on guidance from Governor Gavin Newsom and the California Department of Public Health, the City has issued an order for the cancellation of all non-essential meetings and functions and all large gatherings of 250 people or more,” the city said in a statement. “This includes postponing or cancelling smaller gatherings that do not allow social distancing of six feet per person or involve any individuals at high risk of infection, including individuals over 60 year of age or with underlying conditions.”

The city has also asked that residents who have recently traveled internationally, have had direct contact with someone who has traveled or were experiencing flu-like symptoms or fall into a high-risk category to stay away from public meetings or events.

As of Thursday, the Orange County Health Department has reported six cases — two of which were pending confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In an effort to reduce potential exposure, the Orange County Fire Authority announced that all of its fire stations and headquarters would be closed to the public for the next seven days — starting Thursday at 5 p.m.

“It is imperative to keep our first responders and professional staff healthy, in order to provide exceptional emergency services and meet the needs of the community we serve,” OCFA said in a statement.

The council will meet as scheduled Tuesday — perhaps virtually, for some members — to formally adopt an ordinance related to emergency preparedness, organization and coordination.

The council conducted an emergency meeting Friday evening to unanimously approve an urgency version of the ordinance and formally ratify City Manager Lori Ann Farrell Harrison’s proclamation Thursday of a local emergency.

As of Friday, there were no known cases in Costa Mesa of the coronavirus that causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, the city said.

“We need to assure the city employees, members of the public, business owners, visitors, local stakeholders and partners that their city leaders and public safety officials are prepared and are securing the full suite of resources to help mitigate and reduce the community’s risk,” Farrell Harrison said in a statement.

The ordinance on the table Tuesday would set up a Disaster Council consisting of the city manager, emergency services manager, department heads and leaders of local organizations. The council would become the go-to resource for emergency management in the city — making rules and regulations guiding protection of life and property, acquiring supplies and equipment and developing the city’s emergency plan.

Costa Mesa has adhered to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recommendation Wednesday to cancel gatherings of 250 people or more. It also has canceled all nonessential functions and special events through April, including youth sports, adult recreation classes and some commission and committee meetings, and halted nonessential access to the senior center. Meals and social services are still available at the senior center on a limited basis, according to the city manager.

“These are extraordinary times, which call for extraordinary measures, and we will continue to refine plans as we move forward,” Farrell Harrison said in a letter to the public.

The city’s actions come two weeks after it won its battle against state and federal agencies to keep coronavirus patients from Travis Air Force Base in Northern California from being quarantined at the Fairview Developmental Center on Harbor Boulevard.

City leaders have been meeting about COVID-19 for the past month, the city manager said.

Tuesday’s council meeting begins at 6 p.m. at City Hall, 77 Fair Drive. People who are sick, have recently traveled internationally or been in contact with anyone who has are asked to stay home. The meeting will be accessible online at youtube.com/costamesatv or on Spectrum TV Channel 3 and AT&T U-Verse Channel 99.

Chief public health officer says about seven percent of COVID-19 cases require hospitalization

Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam says the latest data shows about seven per cent of COVID-19 cases in the country have required hospitalization.

About three per cent of cases have required critical care, and about one per cent have been fatal.

She notes that about 30 per cent of people hospitalized are aged 40 and under.

Tam says health officials will keep a close eye on trends of the severity of the disease for signs that more vulnerable people are being affected or that the health system is being overwhelmed.

Ontario may limit gatherings to no more than five people

Premier Doug Ford says he is looking to limit gatherings to no more than five people.

The province is currently limiting gatherings to 50 people and he says a decision could be coming later today.

He says exceptions can be made in special circumstances like in funeral homes, where they could have small groups of people come into the event at a time.

Quebec cases approach 2,500; four more deaths

Quebec is reporting 2,498 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the province and four more deaths, bringing the provincial tally to 22.

Deputy Premier Genevieve Guilbault is also announcing police checkpoints as of this afternoon in eight regions outside of major Quebec cities where the population is deemed more at risk.

Guilbault says only essential travel will be allowed in those regions and says Quebec provincial police have also set up checkpoints near the Canada-U.S. border to intercept snowbirds coming back to Quebec to ensure they understand there’s a 14-day quarantine.

Guilbault says out of 164 people hospitalized, 57 people are in intensive care.

Ontario: Steep fines, possibly jail time for price gouging

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says corporations involved in price gouging amid the COVID-19 crisis will face steep fines and possible jail time.

Ford says company directors found to be involved with price gouging could face fines up to $500,000 and a year in jail.

He says corporations could face a fine of up to $10 million.

Ford is urging the public to contact the provincial government if they see corporations unreasonably raising prices.

144 more cases in Ontario

Ontario has announced 151 new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 1,144.

The Ministry of Health says the number of deaths from the virus remains at 18, and eight cases have been resolved.

The ministry says more than 8,000 investigations into the virus are still pending.

Trump floats 2-week quarantine of NYC, Gov. Cuomo calls it ‘federal declaration of war’

WASHINGTON —President Donald Trump said Saturday that he may order an “enforceable quarantine” for New York City and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut —prompting surprise and shock from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

“This would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I’d rather not do it, but we may need it,” Trump said.

Cuomo likened such a quarantine to a “federal declaration of war” on the city and state. “It would be chaos and mayhem. … I don’t think it is plausible. I don’t think it is legal,” he said hours later on CNN.

Such an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. In China, a two-month lockdown in Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, began easing only on Saturday.

New York has roughly half of the nation’s confirmed cases.

“We’re looking at it and will be making a decision. A lot of the states that are infected — they’ve asked me if I’d look at it so we’re going to look at it,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a short flight to Norfolk, Va., for a visit to a Navy hospital ship headed to New York. “It would be for a short time.”

Cuomo’s immediate reaction: No thanks.

“I don’t like the sound of it,” he told reporters in Albany. “I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don’t know what you would be accomplishing.

France orders a billion protective masks

PARIS — France has ordered more than one billion protective masks, mainly from China, to try to make up for a shortage that is being felt in nations fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced.

But French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, noting tensions in world markets, suggested at a news conference that traffickers and black marketeers are now in the mask business, given the competition in procuring the vital necessity for health workers.

Veran said that an “air bridge” to China was being put in place, but “I will have the certitude (the masks arrived) … only the minute the planes are on the tarmac.” He said one major difficulty is that countries already hit by the virus remain vigilant that should the epidemic return they are equipped.

As of Saturday, France had 37,575 confirmed cases and 2,314 deaths — with 319 new deaths in the last 24 hours, health authorities said.

The prime minister warned the French that “the fight has just begun.”

Infant dies of COVID-19

CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death.

Officials didn’t release other information about the infant, who was from Cook County, which includes Chicago, including whether the child had other health issues.

The risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.

Children have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized.

Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill.

Italy: COVID-19 crisis an “appointment with history”

ROME — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is hoping the European Union will put together a cohesive response to the plight of countries like his, whose economy has been crippled by the coronavirus outbreak.

Conte vowed to fight “to my very last drop of sweat” to prompt a “strong and cohesive European response.” Conte echoed an appeal the same evening by Spain, which is also reeling under a devastating COVID-19 outbreak.

Conte called the crisis “an appointment with history. Europe must say if it’s ready for this appointment” to effectively deal with social and economic shock wreaked by the pandemic.

Germany and the Netherlands are leading other EU nations in resisting calls for an issuance of joint European debt, colloquially dubbed “coronabonds.” Italian Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri expressed dismay that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in an interview described the bond idea as a “only a slogan.”

Crisis may delay Polish elections

WARSAW, Poland — Poland President Andrzej Duda says the May 10 date for the presidential election may not be realistic if the coronavirus spread continues and Poland remains under the current strict isolation regime for the citizens.

Duda’s words were the first sign from the ruling team that the elections may not be held as planned.

Earlier Saturday, the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party had the parliament approve changes to the electoral law to allow sick, quarantined and elderly people to vote remotely, in a clear preparation for May election.

Florida governor supports NYC quarantine

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump, tells reporters he had spoken with the president about the possibility of a coronavirus quarantine for the New York City area.

DeSantis says Florida will soon set up a checkpoint along Interstate 95 to screen travellers from that area, similar to one already in place along Interstate 10 to screen people from Louisiana. Many airports in Florida also are screening travellers from certain areas, requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days.

“I think whatever works is what we need to do,” DeSantis said. “We’re either fighting the virus or we’re not. The more people are being shuttled around the country, I just think it makes it more difficult. I think it would make it a lot easier if we didn’t have folks coming in from hot zones.”

Some South Carolina cities defy governor’s opposition to stay-at-home orders

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Leaders of several South Carolina cities say they are defying Gov. Henry McMaster’s opposition to stay-at-home orders and Attorney General Alan Wilson’s opinion that only McMaster can issue such measures.

In Folly Beach, where town officials had removed their checkpoint and had allowed vacation rentals to resume, the city council unanimously voted to re-establish the checkpoint and ban any new short-term rentals beginning Sunday.

Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin says on Twitter that his city’s stay-at-home order would take effect at 12:01 a.m. Sunday as scheduled. He says Wilson’s Friday opinion is “incorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis.”

Italy frees up $400 million euros for food coupons and food aid

ROME — Three weeks into national containment measures that have shut down most shops and non-essential industry, many Italians are hurting for food money during the lockdown amid the country’s devastating COVID-19 outbreak.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte told the nation he has signed a decree freeing up 400 million euros ($440 million) for food coupons and packages of food aid. Volunteers from Italy’s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.

Conte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: “People are suffering psychologically, they’re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.”

Conte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.

Germany: 12 die in nursing home

BERLIN — Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.

Authorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn’t shown symptoms of COVID-19.

Local officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.

Another nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.

Germany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.

First coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.

One person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.

There are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.

The Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.

Spain: Future of the EU is at stake

MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc’s southern flank.

“It’s Europe’s time to act. Europe is at risk,” Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.

Sanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.

He calls for a “new Marshall Plan” to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.

Italy and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.

Spain: Commuting ban starts Monday

MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.

Sanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home “as if it were a weekend” to “intensify” efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Spain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.

Spain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.

New Orleans one of U.S.’s COVID-19 hot spots

NEW ORLEANS — New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.

The donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.

“Like many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,” New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.

New Orleans is one of the nation’s hot spots for coronavirus.

Italy’s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day

ROME — Italy’s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.

Civil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a one-day high in the country which has the world’s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus.

The day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day’s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of COVID-19 and days ago surpassed the total of China, where the outbreak began in early 2020.

The current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.

U.N. donates protective masks to NYC

UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the donation of 250,000 protective face masks, which had just been located in United Nations storage facilities, to the United States for use in hard-hit New York City.

The U.N. chief says: “These masks, in surplus to United Nations requirements, will be given to the medical professionals in New York City who have been working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives.”

Guterres says the United Nations and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office to ensure swift delivery of the masks to medical facilities around the city.

“On behalf of the U.N. community and the diplomatic corps, we sincerely hope this modest donation makes a difference,” Guterres said.

Illnesses in Detroit, a national hot spot for COVID-19, predicted to worsen next week

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to help the state address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The declaration announced by the White House on Saturday follows a back-and-forth between Trump and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has criticized the Trump administration for its slow response to the pandemic, saying “we cannot weather this alone.”

The U.S. surgeon general said Friday that Detroit, a national “hot spot” for cases of the new coronavirus, will worsen next week. More than 3,600 people in Michigan were confirmed to have COVID-19 Friday. At least 92 have died, most from the three counties in the Detroit area, according to state officials.

So far, there has not been a confirmed coronavirus case in San Bernardino County. However, council members said they have decided to limit exposure by closing all community and neighborhood centers through March 27. That includes the Mary Vagle Nature Center, the Fontana Community Senior Center and the Fontana Park Aquatics Complex.

All recreational programs, activities, classes and sports field rentals have been canceled. Fontana City Hall, the community services department’s administration office and all public safety functions will continue normal operation. This declaration comes a day after President Trump declared a national emergency and makes the city eligible for state and federal funding if needed, a statement from the city said.

The purpose of the emergency is “not to alarm people, but to establish processes and procedures that will limit exposure and remind everyone that together, we can overcome this,” Mayor Acquanetta Warren said in a released statement Saturday.

“This crisis is real, but it doesn’t define us,” she said. “We’ll be fine, but we need your help.”

San Bernardino’s city manager declared a similar emergency, but that city’s council members have yet to approve it.

On Friday, the Fontana Unified School District announced that schools will be closed at least for the next two weeks. San Bernardino County has declared a public health emergency and numerous cities have taken steps to ward off the spread of the coronavirus, including canceling large community gatherings and enacting social distancing measures.

Fontana officials said senior transportation services will continue to operate, but will be limited to 10 passengers per vehicle. The city will implement a meals program for home-bound seniors already registered in its program. More details will become available next week, officials said.

Fresno,CA,,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/coronavirus/article241580081.html,Fresno County CA issues orders to businesses to slow coronavirus,"With community spread of the coronavirus now present in Fresno County, the county’s Department of Public Health issued a pair of new orders Friday for businesses and medical providers.

Effective immediately, businesses must screen all employees for febrile respiratory illness on a daily basis.

Febrile respiratory illness is defined as “a new worsening episode of either cough or shortness of breath, presenting with fever (100.4 degrees) or chills in the previous 24 hours.”

“Community spread ... that’s obviously the most dire case of an epidemic because it’s the hardest to contain,” said Dr. Rais Vohra, Fresno County interim health officer. Vohra defined community spread as a COVID-19 category when a person tests positive without having traveled or having no contact with someone who’s tested positive, so it isn’t exactly clear how the person contracted the virus.

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

“But (community spread),” Vohra added, “it’s also the one where the general public has the most impact that they can make. And that’s really just to protect yourself.”

Businesses are required to exclude any employees who report symptoms of febrile respiratory illness from work for seven days from the day that they are identified as having symptoms.

And businesses must direct employees who’ve been excluded from work to isolate at home and to notify all close contacts to quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last known contact with the patient.

“We know that this virus is contagious and it really benefits from crowds and crowded places and from people being close to one another,” Vohra said. “So anything we can do to help spread ourselves out and to help minimize any inessential and unnecessary social interactions will actually minimize the chance that this virus spreads to our population.”

In addition, health care providers will report on a daily basis to the public health branch of the Health and Human services agency all patients seen in their practice with a febrile respiratory illness.

Health care providers also will require patient information to include demographic information, including age, as well as residential address and clinical status, indicate whether rapid point of care testing was performed and their results, and indicate if COVID-19 testing was done.

And patients, if no exclusionary diagnosis is found, will be directed to quarantine for seven days after onset of symptoms or three days after cessation of fever without the use of fever-reducing medication. They also must notify all close contacts to quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last known contact with the patent.

“I’d like to reiterate that same message that I’ve shared before,” Vohra said. “Because I really feel like it’s our best shot and perhaps our only shot in beating this epidemic without having a lot of lives lost. And that is the message of social distancing.”",None,698021.0,36.7831,-119.7941

Fresno Mayor Lee Brand declared a state of emergency on Monday in response to the coronavirus and announced a number of measures the city is taking to serve residents during the pandemic.

The Fresno City Council voted unanimously to approve the mayor’s declaration during a special meeting on Monday. The council also OK’d a price-gouging ordinance.

Both Brand and Council President Miguel Arias sent messages of unity between city leaders and the community.

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

“More than anything else, I ask the people of Fresno to remain calm during these highly unusual, confusing and stressful times,” he said. “We are all in this together.”

Arias asked residents to look out for one another, especially the elderly and other vulnerable people. He asked younger residents to stay home to protect those populations : “Stay home, save lives.”

The city ordered the Fresno Convention Center, including the Selland Arena and Saroyan Theater, closed and will prohibit public gatherings of 50 people or more. Bars are ordered closed, and restaurants are requested to cut their capacity, per the governor’s recommendation. The city will not issue any new event permits, Arias said.

Water, garbage service will continue

Brand announced a moratorium on shutting off water and stopping garbage services for those with overdue payments. Brand said the city’s water supply has not been compromised and is safe, or safer, to drink than bottled water.

Businesses license tax payment deadlines are postponed until May 1.

Brand alluded to an eviction moratorium potentially coming from the governor or state Legislature and said Fresno will follow those guidelines. But as of his announcement, no state-level decision was announced.

“The important thing for the people of Fresno to know is that no one is going to be forced from their home during this crisis,” Brand said.

Fresno police will assist Fresno schools in managing traffic during meal pickups. Police Chief Andy Hall also said some detectives may be reassigned to patrol.

Meals from the Fresno-Madera Area Agency on Aging will be delivered to homes. City leaders hope to announce soon measures so people 65 and older and other vulnerable populations can safely access grocery stores.

The city is working to provide extra sanitation measures for the homeless and is considering options recommended by the governor. Sanitation and cleaning also will be increased on FAX buses and at the Fresno Yosemite International Airport.

Brand said he will lead by example and follow the governor’s guidelines for people age 65 and older. That means he will work from home as much as possible and avoid most public events. City employees 65 and older and those considered vulnerable to COVID-19 were asked Sunday evening to stay home, with pay.

City Hall will remain open to serve customers, but Brand encouraged people to use online services and the FresGo mobile app.

Councilmember calls for stricter prohibition

Councilmember Nelson Esparza said the city’s action on Monday was important but still comes up short. He called on the mayor to prohibit all non-essential gatherings of 10 or more people and to encourage residents to refrain from public life as much as possible.

“The only way that we as a human species can beat this virus right now is by continuing our aggressive path of social distancing,” he said. “We all have concerns about the state of the economy, but we do know that it is going to get worst before it gets better. When the dust settles, we will work aggressively to help our local economy get back on its feet. We as leaders must protect human life from COVID-19 right now at all costs.”

The move comes one day after Fresno County declared a state of emergency. So far, there are two patients countywide who have tested positive for coronavirus.",state_of_emergency,698021.0,36.7831,-119.7941

Fresno County declared a state of emergency Sunday after health officials confirmed a second case of coronavirus and await results from dozens of tests.

“I can unequivocally tell you that COVID-19 is here,” said Dr. Rais Vohra, interim health officer for Fresno County Department of Public Health. “The labs will be starting to come back, and we are going to see more and more positive test results in our county. These numbers are going to go up, possibly dramatically.”

The second person to test positive with coronavirus was a middle-aged man who traveled outside the country. He’s recovering in isolation at home, Vohra said. Health officials are investigating the case trace the patient’s contacts and contain any fallout, Vohra said. The patient was tested several days ago, and the county received the positive test results Saturday morning.

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

Vohra also provided an update on the county’s first coronavirus patient: that person is recovering and none of their family members show signs of symptoms. While Vohra couldn’t confirm the patient tested negatively, he could confirm the patient hasn’t tested positive again.

Fewer than 60 Fresno County residents have submitted swabs for testing, and 50-75 people are being monitored after they returned from travel. While Fresno County doesn’t have a lab that can test the swabs, the county has multiple labs available to send samples to, said David Pomaville, director of Fresno County Public Health Department.

One person with coronavirus on average could infect two or three others.

Declaring a state of emergency will give the county flexibility in managing its approximately 7,000 employees, many of whom have families affected by the school closures, Pomaville said. Later on, the declaration could also help the county apply for any funding relief. So far, costs incurred because of the coronavirus pandemic mostly amount to overtime pay, Pomaville said.

Vohra spent the weekend helping test people for COVID-19 out of an emergency clinic that was set up outside a medical facility. Test results for those patients will return in several cases.

‘Social distancing’

While the risk of contracting the virus remains low for many Fresno County residents, health officials recommended people prepare for “social distancing.” That means avoiding social gatherings of 250 people or more for people with low risk. More vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or those with compromised immune systems, it’s best to avoid gatherings bigger than 10 people.

It’s important to face the pandemic, and the public health department is ready to deal with and manage it, Vohra said.

“I’m confident we will rise to this occasion,” he said.

While Mayor Lee Brand attended the news conference where county officials gave updates, he did not make any announcements for the city of Fresno. Those will come Monday, he said.

Health officials also addressed the public anxiety and stress about the epidemic.

Dawan Utech, director of Fresno County Behavioral Health, said it’s important to establish trusted resources, such as information from the county’s health departments. It’s important for everyone to do their part to prevent the spread by practicing social distancing, she said.

“We know that keeping your mental health well is important in countering physical health issues, too,” she said.",state_of_emergency,698021.0,36.7831,-119.7941

The proclamation will come before the Gilroy City Council for ratification at its meeting on Monday, March 16.

The emergency proclamation coincides with the recent orders from the Santa Clara County Public Health Department prohibiting gatherings of more than 100 people and the County Superintendent’s closing schools for the next three weeks.

“Despite having no confirmed cases in the City of Gilroy, medical experts report that slowing the spread of COVID-19 by social distancing will help prevent our healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed,” Forbis said in a statement released Friday afternoon. “If the number of cases can be stretched out over time, not exceeding our healthcare systems capacity, then people will get the care they need. All members of our community play a vital role in slowing the spread through intentional social distancing measures such as limiting gatherings and we encourage all members of the community to follow the guidelines provided by the Santa Clara County Public Health Department.”

Effective immediately through April 5, 2020:

The March 16 City Council Meeting will be held in Council Chambers and live-streamed through the City website. Residents are encouraged to view remotely and will be able to provide public comments through WebEx.

Except for City Council meetings, all board and commission meetings are canceled.

All recreation programs including adaptive, adult, preschool, sports, and youth programs have been canceled. Contact the Recreation Department for more information at 408-846-0460.

All senior programs are canceled. Box lunches and the Second Harvest Food Bank Brown Bag will continue to be provided.

All special event permits are canceled.

All reservations for City facilities and public parks will be canceled with automatic refunds.

“The health and safety of our community is our top priority,” said Mayor Roland Velasco in a statement. “While our community centers and recreation programs are valued by residents, we know that social distancing works and that these closures will help slow the spread of coronavirus in the community. In addition, we encourage those who are sick or who are at higher risk for serious illness to stay at home. This proclamation provides us the flexibility to position resources and best address this public health crisis.”

The city now has 29 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, up from 12 reported at the end of last week, and recently saw its first death as a result of the outbreak, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health.

On Tuesday, City Council members voted unanimously to extend the period set to expire March 31, amid a meeting where scores of tenants voiced concerns about whether emergency eviction protections would cover them for the next month.

A halt on evictions for those affected by the virus will remain in place, along with all of the city’s emergency orders. That includes the closure of nonessential retail businesses, public facilities and hiking trails, a blanket ban on residential rent increases, the suspension of some street-sweeping restrictions and free rides on the local bus line.

Gatherings of more than 10 people in close quarters are also prohibited.

Glendale’s emergency period now extends beyond Los Angeles County’s, which is set to expire April 19.

Aligning the end date with the end of the month was done to create a more consistent cycle and reduce confusion, according to Mayor Ara Najarian.

The date “could very well be amended again,” Najarian said. “That depends on how the number of cases either grows or becomes controlled.”

Across the county, there have been at least 1,465 cases and 26 deaths tied to the virus.

On March 16, Glendale declared a local state of emergency just hours after a local hospital confirmed the city’s first case of the virus. Since then, the number of confirmed local cases has risen steadily, adding to a rapidly rising county toll.

Since then, the city has followed the state and county’s lead, implementing social-distancing requirements, including a state mandate that requires residents to stay home except for essential needs.

Najarian said he doesn’t think all local residents are taking the increasingly stringent restrictions seriously enough, adding that he thinks the next seven days will be critical in terms of whether the area can contain the virus or see a large spike.

“It’s not like the German bombing of London, where everyone congregates together. It’s a different attack that we’re under,” he said. “Each and every one of us could be a carrier, and many people just don’t get it.”

The city is currently weighing whether to further restrict access to parks, he added.

Effective Tuesday evening, following a unanimous vote by City Council members, landlords of residential properties are prohibited from implementing rent increases through at least April 30.

Rent hikes that went into effect before the moratorium was adopted will still be valid, as per a recommendation by City Atty. Mike Garcia.

Increases noticed by landlords prior to the order, but that have not gone into effect, are prohibited from going forward, according to city spokeswoman Eliza Papazian.

Last week, the city halted evictions of residential and commercial tenants who can show they are unable to pay rent because of economic hardship related to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 during the emergency period. Tenants will still have to pay any rent they missed but will have a six-month period to do so.

Los Angeles went further, temporarily stopping all no-fault evictions for residential and commercial tenants. This past Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom halted evictions of renters affected by the virus statewide.

Glendale’s emergency period was previously extended until March 31. That date was extended to the end of April on Tuesday during a council meeting, which was held as a teleconference.

“People are very scared, [council members] are at least aware of that. That’s a good first step,” said Karen Kwak, a renter and member of the Glendale Tenants Union.

“It’s still not going to be enough, and I hope that they consider further action,” Kwak said.

Kwak surmised that thousands of local residents might not be able to pay rent come April 1 or the following month, depending on how the crisis develops and individual circumstances.

There is understanding from the California Apartment Assn., a large trade group representing the rental housing industry, that there is a need for protections applied specifically to those who suffered economic setbacks related to the virus, according to Fred Sutton, who handles the group’s public affairs for L.A. County.

“We’re all impacted in some way by the virus, but we’re not all impacted financially the same way,” Sutton said.

He said the group supported renters providing proof of economic hardship, something the city requires for tenants to receive the emergency eviction protection. The rent increase moratorium applies to all residential units in the city, according to Papazian.

Council members adopted the moratorium after a stream of residents called in asking city officials to consider rent forgiveness, or what many called a rent freeze, while residents grapple with new unemployment or increased medical bills in the wake of the pandemic.

Some called for a freeze of mortgages and utility bills as well.

Glendale has 29 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to county health officials. The virus has claimed one local resident’s life. Countless others are dealing with jobs lost due to nonessential business closures mandated by the city and county last week.

Haley Hopkins, a 23-year-old Glendale resident, told the council that she lost her job as a self-described blue-collar worker in the arts industry as a result of the pandemic.

According to Hopkins, the renter protections offered by the city are not sufficient to meet the crisis at hand, echoing several others who called into the virtual meeting to advocate for rent forgiveness.

“I’m truly wondering how any one of you think I’m supposed to pay my rent without being able to earn an income,” Hopkins said during the public comment portion of the meeting.

She surmised that many residents will have trouble paying back missed rent and that landlords might be able to find loopholes in the rules.

Kwak is continuing to work from home as a freelance editor and proofreader but said she lost a part-time contract job with a law firm that was essential for making ends meet.

While she has savings to last through April, she worries about what will happen in May if she can’t find a way to supplement her income.

Exempting struggling residents from rent is not as simple as declaring it so, according to several Glendale officials.

Implementing a rent freeze could violate state law and the Constitution, issues that would need to be addressed before a proposal could be considered, according to Garcia.

It might take federal action — such as a one-year mortgage forgiveness or stimulus funding — to make such a measure feasible, Mayor Ara Najarian said during the meeting.

On Wednesday, Newsom announced that several major banks and institutions had agreed to a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments.

Families should not lose their homes because of COVID-19. Very pleased that Wells Fargo, Citi, JPMorgan, and US Bank have agreed to a 90 day grace period for mortgage payments for those impacted by #COVID19.



A big sigh of relief for millions of CA families. — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) March 25, 2020

Councilwoman Paula Devine said she was worried about the domino effect that rent forgiveness could have, pointing out that landlords might consequently be unable to pay their mortgages, which could then have a negative impact on lenders.

“We need to be fair to both the renters and the landlords,” Devine said.

Sutton called the proposal “reckless and naive,” adding that workers connected to the property business — like management companies, plumbers and gardeners — would suffer serious losses as well.

Glendale Tenants Union members are aware that there’s no simple solution to the problem but that tenants are feeling desperate, Kwak said.

She’s heard “buzz” about attempting a rent strike, something the tenant’s union hasn’t advocated.

“This is the mood of a lot of tenants across the city,” Kwak said.

County’s ‘Safer at Home’ order, requiring the closure of more businesses","For at least the next month, Glendale residents have been ordered to stay at home and leave only for essential needs, following a statewide directive given by Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Glendale will also follow L.A. County’s “Safer at Home” order, announced by officials, including Supervisor Kathryn Barger, at a press conference earlier on Thursday evening. It mandates the closure of indoor malls, shopping centers, playgrounds and all nonessential retail businesses and prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people within enclosed spaces.

Grocery stores, restaurants offering takeout, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, laundromats, social-service providers and media outlets will continue operating.

Residents are permitted to leave their homes to buy groceries, care for relatives and for medical needs.

“Changing our routines is difficult, but it will protect our most vulnerable populations while also ensuring the health and safety of our city,” Glendale Mayor Ara Najarian said in a statement. “It is our responsibility to take care of our children, parents, grandparents and our community.”

Shortly after the announcement, Najarian tweeted, “Many activities are permitted, many businesses are still permitted to operate.”

L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti stressed that “this is not a lockdown,” adding that people can walk around their neighborhoods and hike as long as they practice social distancing.

L.A. implemented stricter rules than the county, requiring all nonessential businesses that require in-person attendance to cease operations and banning gatherings outside the home, with exceptions for both.

The rules are not just guidelines. Residents who don’t follow them could potentially face a misdemeanor charge or fines.

The back-to-back orders arrived after the virus that causes COVID-19 claimed its second life in L.A. County, in the Pasadena area. To date, there are four confirmed cases in Glendale and at least 231 across L.A. County. Burbank confirmed its first case on Thursday.

The order went into effect at midnight on Thursday for residents and is currently slated to last until April 19. Businesses have an additional 24 hours to comply.

The City of Goleta took aggressive action tonight to “flatten the curve” and help slow and prevent the spread of COVID-19. At tonight’s City Council meeting, the council ratified the City Manager’s local emergency proclamation. This action will enhance the City’s ability to access federal and state dollars for COVID-19 response.

In his opening remarks, Mayor Pro Tempore Kyle Richards said, “Tonight we are holding this Goleta City Council meeting under extraordinary and unprecedented circumstances. With the coronavirus pandemic spreading quickly throughout the world and our state, we are preparing for a worsening situation here in our community. It is critical that we act now to reduce our social contacts, so that we can slow the spread of the virus through our communities and allow extra time for our hospitals and medical professionals to keep up with the demand.”

In an effort to reduce social contacts and slow the spread of the virus, the City Council passed a resolution ordering restaurants, banquet facilities, bars, night clubs and lounges to temporarily close while still allowing certain take-out orders and meal delivery. All gyms, fitness centers, theatres, bowling alleys and arcades were ordered to temporarily close as well.

The resolution also prohibits access to play structures and exercise equipment in City parks, beaches and open spaces. Signs will be posted to remind users of COVID-19 symptoms and risks and to social distance.

These orders will take effect immediately and will remain in place for sixty days starting on March 17, 2020 unless extended.

The emergency measures are similar to actions taken by cities and counties throughout the State of California and are in line with recent guidance from the California Department of Public Health.

Mayor Paula Perotte said, “These measures are an expression of our highest priority – assuring the safety and well-being of our community. This resolution is consistent with the actions being taken by growing numbers of other cities in addressing the unprecedented challenges posed by this emergency.”

The City Council also approved a temporary moratorium on residential and commercial evictions arising from nonpayment of rent caused by loss of income arising from COVID-19. This moratorium takes effect on March 17, 2020 and will remain in place for 60 days unless extended.

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials say the risk is low for Canadians but warn this could change quickly. They caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. And if you get sick, stay at home.

Until further notice, all non-essential city-owned and city-controlled buildings made available to the public for social purposes will not be available for rent and all non-essential city-sponsored events are canceled or postponed to a future date.

The resolution also suspends discontinuation of water and refuse collection services for residents and businesses for non-payment of bills for city-provided utility services and suspends the imposition of late payment penalties and fees for delinquent city utility bills while the emergency is in place.

One area of the resolution that was altered by council was a section that said inspections associated with issuance of building permits for existing construction would be suspended because they could potentially put employees in enclosed spaces and/or near members of the public in a manner inconsistent with social distancing guidelines.

Members of the council like Sue Sorensen and Art Brieno were not comfortable with this section and wanted to make sure permits and inspections would still be allowed so residents could continue to do what they need to do.

The rest of the council agreed that the section should allow for more discretion on the part of the city manager to work with the public, while keeping employees safe.",state_of_emergency,92066.0,36.3264,-119.6544

Posted March 12, 2020

March 12: City of Healdsburg Declares Local Emergency to Respond to Coronavirus

City of Healdsburg Declares Local Emergency to Respond to Coronavirus

The St. Patrick's Day Parade will be canceled and other City-sponsored public events will be postponed for the next several weeks to help prevent the spread of the disease

Out of an abundance of caution, the City of Healdsburg has declared a Local Emergency to respond to the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). This declaration empowers the City to access state and federal resources, mutual aid, and other tools to help protect the community and City facilities from this virus outbreak, which the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic.

Healdsburg City Manager David Mickaelian signed the declaration of Local Emergency today and the Healdsburg City Council will consider the declaration for ratification at its meeting on 6 p.m., Monday, March 16, at City Hall, 401 Grove Street.

""Declaring a local emergency means that we can more easily access state and federal funding and other resources to help fight this outbreak,"" said Mr. Mickaelian. ""It's a prudent and pro-active action to keep all of our community members healthy.""

Healdsburg's declaration of Local Emergency follows emergency declarations by the County of Sonoma, the cities of Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, and Petaluma. Sonoma County is regularly updating information about the novel coronavirus at www.socoemergency.org.

City-sponsored public events postponed

In addition to declaring a Local Emergency, the City of Healdsburg is postponing City-sponsored public events for the next few weeks.

This decision comes after guidance from Gov. Gavin Newsom to postpone all non-essential gatherings of 250 people or more through the end of March as well as recommendations from the Sonoma County Public Health Officer to cancel or postpone non-essential indoor events of 50 people or more for adults over age 60 and those with chronic medical conditions.

Specifically, the California Department of Public Health finds the following:

Large gatherings that include 250 people or more should be postponed or canceled. This includes concerts, conferences, and professional, college, and school sporting events.

Smaller gatherings held in venues that do not allow social distancing of six feet per person should be postponed or canceled. This includes gatherings in crowded auditoriums, rooms or other venues.

Gatherings of people at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should be limited to no more than 10 people. This includes gatherings at retirement facilities, assisted living facilities, developmental homes, and support groups for people with health conditions.

A ""gathering"" is any event or convening that brings together people in a single room or single space at the same time, such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, cafeteria, or any other indoor or outdoor space.

In Healdsburg, the public events that will not be held include the March 17 St. Patrick's Day Parade and Celtic Concert and the April 18 Senior Center bus trip to see the play, ""Book of Mormon,"" in San Francisco.

The City continues to work with the Sonoma County Department of Emergency Management and Department of Health Services – which is working closely with the California Department of Public Health -- to monitor the coronavirus situation on an ongoing basis and may extend this event restriction as necessary.

""Our number-one goal is to keep the Healdsburg community safe and informed,"" said Healdsburg City Manager David Mickaelian. ""We are collaborating daily with the County's health department to see what actions we and the community need to take going forward.""

Cleaning and disinfecting City facilities

The City is taking extra steps to clean and disinfect City facilities to help guard community members from contracting the virus.

Public bathrooms in City facilities now undergo a deeper cleaning and City staff are disinfecting frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and knobs, table tops and handrails with alcohol-based wipes more often. Hand-sanitizer stations have also been placed at all City facilities and signage in both English and Spanish on good hygiene practice has been posted as well.

Practice good hygiene

The novel coronavirus is impacting all facets of private and public life and it's important that everyone does their part to keep healthy. The City encourages everyone to keep practicing good hygiene – that's the most effective way to stay healthy. Hygiene practices include:

Wash hands thoroughly and frequently.

Avoid touching your face, especially our eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Cough and sneeze into your sleeved elbow.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Stay home if you're ill.

Staff Writer

In a hastily called emergency meeting Monday morning, March 16, via telephone, the Hemet City Council passed a resolution proclaiming the existence of an emergency situation in the city and local emergency due to the worldwide spread of COVID-19.

The emergency resolution states the city council “will utilize, to the extent reasonably feasible and appropriate, the ability to conduct its council meeting via teleconferencing and other electronic means to permit council members and members of the public to adopt social distancing to the greatest extent possible while still proceeding with the efficient handling of the city’s business, in compliance with California Executive Order N-25-20.”

The resolution as written will stand for a 60-day period unless lifted by consequent meetings.

Joining in the teleconferencing meeting that began at 8 a.m. were all five members of the city council, Hemet fire Chief Scott Brown, police Chief Eddie Pust, the city attorney, the city clerk, city manager Christopher Lopez and members of the media, including the Valley News.

Discussed was how future council meetings can be held and still keep within most conditions of the Ralph M. Brown Act and how the city can reach out for financial and the public safety needs of the community in light of the pandemic.

The public will be allowed to tune in to the meetings in progress via the telephone, where they can still comment or through other electronic media.

The resolution reads “the spread and potential further spread of COVID-19 constitutes a situation that severely impairs the public health and safety within the city of Hemet and constitutes conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property within the city of Hemet.”

There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:



Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC's recommendations for using a facemask. CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Highland,CA,03-25-2020 19:55,https://www.redlandsdailyfacts.com/highland-declares-emergency-in-response-to-coronavirus,Highland declares emergency in response to coronavirus,"Highland declared a local emergency in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak the same day health officials announced the first death in San Bernardino County due to COVID-19, which is caused by the virus.

On Tuesday, March 24, the City Council joined a teleconference with City Clerk Betty Hughes, who ran the meeting at the council chambers. No members of the public attended the special meeting, Hughes said.

Adopting the resolution helps the city qualify for state, federal, and other funding opportunities related to the crisis. According to a report to the City Council, the fiscal impact to the city due to the outbreak will be “significant.”

The move also “authorizes the undertaking of extraordinary police powers, provides limited immunity for emergency actions of public employees and governing bodies, and authorizes the issuance of orders and regulations to protect life and property,” according to the report. “The proclamation of local emergency will allow the City Manager to take any actions necessary to address or mitigate impacts COVID-19 have on City operations and services.”

The vote was 4-0 with Councilwoman Anaeli Solano absent.

Other steps taken by the city to slow the spread of the virus include closing City Hall through April 6, though most activities can be done by mail and email, and canceling or postponing the Citrus Harvest Festival originally set for Saturday, March 28.

City leaders met — several feet apart from one another — on Monday evening to unanimously declare a local emergency, approve a three-pronged emergency response plan and officially launch the next phase of that program.

The vote triggered the cancellation of all non-essential recreational services at city libraries and community centers. Library late fees and holds are suspended during the closure.

Huntington Beach already had suspended all library events through April 12.

Essential senior care services, including health checks, transit and meal services, will continue, according to the city’s new response website, HBready.com.

City Manager Oliver Chi added that the city will begin reassigning staff members from departments affected by closures to help serve residents considered more at risk of serious effects from the coronavirus-caused respiratory disease COVID-19 (those in their 60s or older who have preexisting health issues) and create new programs to address the growing problem.

“[Impacts of social distancing are] creating just unprecedented social upheaval right now,” Chi said. “There’s no way to mitigate those impacts, but the silver lining right now is all the different levers that government can try to influence are being pulled to try to mitigate the issues that people are experiencing.”

Following the lead of state and federal officials, Huntington Beach is asking the community to cancel gatherings of 250 or more people, or gatherings of 10 or more people by organizations that serve the higher-risk population.

The City Council’s discussion of specific responses to the coronavirus were punctuated with figures about the virus’s potentially devastating effects.

Fire Chief Scott Haberle said the Orange County healthcare system doesn’t have the capacity to deal with critical-care patients at the potential rate. About 15% of Orange County’s population of about 3 million is 65 or older, according to U.S. Census estimates as of July 1. But the number of staffed hospital and intensive care unit beds in the county amounts to about 5,500, Haberle said.

“The reality is, we can’t build more hospitals overnight,” Haberle said. “We really need to slow the spread of the disease going forward.”

Hotels and other tourist-oriented businesses that pay into the city’s transient occupancy tax are expected to see a sharp decline in revenue due to fewer people traveling — at least a 20% decrease in reservations over the next 3½ months, Chi projected.

Officials estimated a loss of $2.5 million to $3 million in the transient occupancy tax, plus $1 million to $1.5 million in sales taxes, for a total loss of $3.5 million to $4.5 million for the city.

“The local hotel industry in Huntington Beach is really one of the bedrocks of our local economy,” Chi said. “Those ripples go throughout our entire economy.”

The city has been in touch with the Small Business Administration to help local businesses access funding, Chi said.

As part of its response plan, the city also will cancel all work travel, not schedule events with more than 50 people and potentially cancel some commission and community support meetings. City staff also is meeting with community groups, such as the local interfaith council, to coordinate responses for higher-risk populations, Chi said.

“We kind of do what we’re doing here, so it’s not so much worried about us getting the flu or me getting the flu, it’s me transmitting it to somebody else who may not have the wherewithal to combat it,” Councilman Mike Posey said.

Gavin Newsom on Friday announced a temporary statewide ban on evictions of those affected by the virus.

The governor’s executive order will prevent evictions over nonpayment of rent through May. It will cover those who have lost work, become sick or had to take care of ill family members because of the pandemic and the associated closures and restrictions intended to inhibit the spread of the virus.

Law enforcement and the courts will be prohibited from executing evictions while the order is in effect.

Renters will still be required to eventually pay all the rent they owe, and they must notify their landlords in writing within seven days of nonpayment.

Advertisement

The Laguna Beach City Council is scheduled Tuesday to consider authorizing sending a letter to local residential and commercial landlords, asking them to defer rent collection through May and forgo evictions for nonpayments related to the virus.

City staff’s recommendation did not include an eviction moratorium like that approved by Costa Mesa but rather to seek cooperation from landlords.

“This pandemic and the mitigation measures necessary to slow and reduce the spread of COVID-19 have significant financial impacts to residents and businesses in Laguna Beach,” according to a staff report prepared for Tuesday’s meeting. “Many tenants have lost their income as a result of their businesses closing, being laid off or furloughed or complying with [Gov. Gavin Newsom’s] stay-at-home order.”

Advertisement

“It is expected that tenants will experience increasing hardship from being sick with COVID-19 and caring for a household or family member who is sick with COVID-19,” the report said.

The report references closures throughout the city of businesses considered nonessential and restaurants’ shift to relying on delivery and takeout while dine-in services are suspended.

The actions encouraged in the letter would prevent avoidable homelessness and allow for those whose income and ability to work are affected by the virus to remain in their homes while offering greater stability for commercial tenants, city staff said.

Proposed tourism marketing district

Visit Laguna Beach, the city’s tourism arm, is proposing converting the city’s business improvement district into a tourism marketing district.

The business improvement district was adopted in April 2001 with the intent of using additional taxes on businesses to promote offseason cultural events and encourage hotel occupancy.

Converting to a tourism marketing district would allow the district a five-year term instead of being renewed annually. If approved, the term would begin July 1 and end June 30, 2025.

The City Council on Tuesday will receive comments about forming the district but will not take action.

The proposed tourism marketing district would include all lodging businesses within city borders. An annual assessment of 2% of gross short-term room rental revenue would fund sales, marketing and communications and programs by the city Arts Commission, Laguna College of Art + Design, Laguna Playhouse and Laguna Art Museum.

This declaration implements the emergency plan of the municipality and will help protect the health, safety, well-being and property of residents. This declaration of a State of Emergency is effective immediately and will remain in effect until further notice.

The declaration of an emergency under s 4 (1) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act provides the County of Lennox and Addington with all options available to protect the health and safety of individuals and families living in Lennox and Addington.

Working with the four lower-tier municipalities (Addington Highlands, Loyalist Township, Greater Napanee, Stone Mills) and community partners, the County of Lennox and Addington has been pragmatic in managing the COVID-19 situation. The County activated the joint Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) in conjunction with the lower-tier municipalities on Friday, March 13th. This team has met daily to ensure a coordinated approach in dealing with COVID-19.

With evidence of community spread of COVID-19 in the KFL&A region, it has been determined an emergency exists within the County that places residents at risk. “We must act now to address this serious public health threat.” said Dr. Kieran Moore, Medical Officer of Health at KFL&A Public Health. “This situation clearly illustrates the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and emphasizes the importance of practicing physical distancing and self-isolation in order to control the community spread of the virus.”

“During this difficult time, we are asking everyone in the community to take physical distancing seriously, especially around vulnerable populations” stated Warden Isbester. “And please, please stay at home to reduce the likelihood of further transmission.”

Precautions to prevent transmission include self-isolation, maintaining at least 2 metre distance from others, avoiding all unnecessary travel, washing your hands often, and regularly disinfecting high touch zones in shared spaces in your home.

The County has been proactive in its response to COVID-19 and will continue to take action to help contain the spread of this virus. Although municipal offices are closed to the public, essential services will continue to be provided. Warden Isbester added, “By acting decisively as a community, we can ensure the safety and well-being of our residents is maintained.”

City facilities remain open.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Wednesday to provide additional resources, prevent price gouging and help the state better prepare for the virus's spread.

The emergency declaration followed the first known coronavirus-related death in California — an elderly Placer County resident who was exposed to the virus on a Grand Princess cruise Feb. 11-21 from San Francisco to Mexico and back.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that include the common cold as well as much more serious diseases. The strain that emerged in China in late 2019, now called COVID-19, is related to others that have caused serious outbreaks in recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on Jan. 21. The disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.

According to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.

To avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.

London,CA,,https://globalnews.ca/news/6708850/london-state-of-emergency-coronavirus-covid-19/,City of London declares state of emergency over coronavirus pandemic,"The city of London has declared a state of emergency as officials continue to monitor the increasing impact of the novel coronavirus.

Officials say the declaration will provide the city with all available options to protect the health and safety of individuals and families living in London.

“We want to make sure we’re taking all the actions we can to make sure that all the resources are available in terms of how the city responds to the crisis,” Helmer told Global News Radio 980 CFPL, adding the decision came following consultations Friday afternoon at the city’s Emergency Operations Centre in Byron.

According to the city, such a declaration would provide London access to provincial funding should it become available.

The decision was made in conjunction with Mayor Ed Holder, who went into self-isolation this week and will remain there until the end of March.

“This is the right call, at the right time,” said Holder in a statement.

Helmer said they were also making the declaration to reinforce to residents that COVID-19 is a continued threat to the city, and that the situation is urgent.

“We’re really trying to reinforce the message from the [Middlesex-London Health Unit] to take all the steps they’re recommending to slow the spread of the virus,” he said.

“It’s something that is going to require all levels of government to act,” Helmer said. “We’re seeing throughout Ontario, a number of municipalities that have made similar declarations of states of emergency. Even in other municipalities in our region.”

This comes the same day the Middlesex-London Health Unit reported six new cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 11.

The health unit says those who’ve tested positive for the illness are self-isolating and staff will be following up with their close contacts to advise them to self-isolate for the next 14 days.

The declaration today will not impact our current day-to-day police operations since our initial changes were announced on Friday, March 13, 2020. We want to reassure the public that the LPS’s capacity to respond to emergency calls was and is not a factor in this declaration. https://t.co/xgjAEwDHFO — London Police Service ON (@lpsmediaoffice) March 20, 2020

A City of London news release says emergency services, like police, fire and EMS, will continue to operate, and the city will continue with minimal operations and essential services.

Are you a non-essential business defying government orders to close amid the COVID-19 pandemic?

How about a Londoner going to the grocery store despite recently testing positive?

Or maybe a traveller failing to self-quarantine for two weeks after returning from south of the border?

If you’re any or all of these things, the city has a message for you: follow COVID-19-related orders or face the consequences.

To prove they’re not bluffing, the city, in partnership with the London Police Service (LPS) and the Middlesex-London Health Unit (MLHU), says a new tipline has been set up to crack down on those flouting provincial orders and municipal closures.

Londoners can contact the tipline by email or phone to voice concerns about non-essential businesses that are still open, large gatherings of 50 or more people, Londoners not following federal government quarantine orders, and people taking part in activities at closed outdoor structures.

“Everyone has the responsibility to follow all of the orders that have been issued by governments, and to take every precaution possible to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Dave O’Brien, the city’s division manager of corporate security and emergency management, in a statement Friday.

Despite efforts from health and government officials in reinforcing the importance of physical distancing and, if necessary, self-quarantining, O’Brien says they continue to see people not paying attention.

“When we receive a call or email through this new process, we will work with our community partners at LPS and MLHU to enforce the restrictions that have been put in place,” he said.

Londoners can utilize the tipline by emailing COVIDOrderConcerns@london.ca or by dialing 519-661-4660.

The city says the email address will be monitored 24/7, while the phone line will be monitored Monday to Friday from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:



Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC's recommendations for using a facemask. CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

Manila,CA,03-14-2020 09:34,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/philippines-declares-curfew-in-manila-to-fight-coronavirus-1.4853140,Philippines declares curfew in Manila to fight coronavirus,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES -- Philippine officials on Saturday announced a nighttime curfew in the capital and said people in the densely populated region should leave their homes during the daytime only for work or urgent errands under restrictions imposed to fight the coronavirus.

Drastic steps announced by President Rodrigo Duterte this past week sparked widespread confusion and questions, prompting officials on Saturday to detail the measures and issue guidelines for the monthlong restrictions in Manila that will take effect on Sunday.

The measures include suspending domestic travel by land, air and sea to and from the capital region, home to more than 12 million people. Large gatherings like concerts and movies will be prohibited and most government work in executive department offices will be suspended in the metropolis. Suspensions of school classes at all levels were extended by a month.

A copy of the guidelines said the movement of people in the metropolis ""shall be limited to accessing basic necessities and work.""

""If you'll go to work, go. If you need to go out for medical treatment, go. If you'll buy food, go, but other than that, stay home,"" Interior Secretary Eduardo Ano told a news conference. ""We should practice social distancing.""

Philippine health officials reported 34 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 98. Eight of the patients have died.

While the virus can be deadly, particularly for the elderly and those with other health problems, for most people it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Some feel no symptoms at all and the vast majority of people recover.

Ano said the 8 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew, which was not among the restrictions announced by Duterte on Thursday, would apply to nonessential trips and leisure gatherings like parties, family reunions and concerts. Stressing the urgency of the move, he cited the case of Italy, where he said the numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths alarmingly spiked because effective containment steps were not put in place early.

A police general, Guillermo Eleazar, said cities and towns would enforce the curfew once their separate councils have authorized it in the next few days.

Ano warned that infections may exponentially increase to several thousands in five months in the Philippines if effective containment actions are not set in place. He told The Associated Press that it's one of the worst-case scenarios drawn up by the government along with World Health Organization experts.

A Manila official, Jojo Garcia, said shopping malls would also be asked to temporarily close, except for grocery stores and supermarkets. ""In this time, who will go shopping for a new pair of shoes?"" Garcia said.

The temporary restrictions will not amount to a lockdown of the capital because large numbers of workers, emergency personnel like medical staffs and residents on urgent errands could move within the metropolis or enter and leave the area after showing valid IDs, officials said.

Movement of cargo and food shipments will continue unhampered, they said.

Metropolitan Manila police chief Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas has threatened to arrest people who don't comply with the restrictions. Thousands of police will be deployed and checkpoints will be set up in entryways to metropolitan Manila, he said.

But a prominent human rights lawyer, Jose Manuel Diokno, said law enforcers could not arrest anyone for resisting emergency health restrictions.

Under Philippine law, police can arrest people without a warrant only if they have committed or are about to commit a crime, Diokno said.

The 74-year-old Duterte himself was tested for the virus on Thursday after he met Cabinet officials, who said they were exposed to people who tested positive for the coronavirus. Duterte tested negative, according to his spokesman.

Local schools in Merced County began preparations Monday to shut down classes for at least a month amid the growing threat of coronavirus.

Meanwhile, the Merced County Board of Supervisors on Monday formally declared an emergency. As of Monday afternoon, Merced County had no confirmed coronavirus infections. Nearby Stanislaus County, however, has reported three infections.

Merced County Office of Emergency Services and the Department of Public Health first declared a health emergency Friday. The Board of Supervisors held an emergency meeting Monday to officially ratify the plan.

“This declaration wasn’t made lightly,” Supervisor Scott Silveira said about the local public health emergency. “This cuts through the bureaucratic red tape.”

The declaration opens the county to funding, reimbursement and resources, as well as expediting emergency response processes that are typically slowed by local provisions or regulations.

County officials said it is not a matter of if the county gets a confirmed COVID-19 case, but when. They stressed that the situation is evolving rapidly. “These two emergency declarations are preemptive,” Supervisor Lloyd Pareira said. “The emergency hasn’t shown itself in Merced yet.”

County Public Health Director Rebecca Nanyonjo-Kemp said it’s possible someone in Merced County could already have the virus, but without increased laboratory testing capability, the county cannot be sure.

“We have been impacted, as the rest of this state has been, with our laboratory testing capabilities to get a true and accurate portrait of the spread of disease throughout this community,” she said.

Twenty individuals have been tested for coronavirus in Merced County. All came back negative or are still awaiting results. That number does not include commercial labs, which recently gained the ability to test for COVID-19. However, the county would be notified if any tests were positive.

County officials continued to urge people to disseminate accurate information and curb the spread of misinformation, which can cause panic. Official information and resources can be found through the county, the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.

Impact on local schools and parents

On Sunday, Merced County school district superintendents and county education officials held an emergency meeting where they decided to close classes at all 20 local school districts starting Thursday, preschool through 12th grade, with classes expected to resume Monday, April 20.

School officials said they are using Monday through Wednesday to give school districts a chance to plan for drive-thru meal services, which will launch Thursday.

Some parents aren’t waiting until the schools officially close to keep their children at home. For example, unofficial numbers from the Merced Union High School District show that excused absences Monday were up to four and half times higher than normal, according to Sam Yniguez, district spokesperson.

Yniguez said parents who choose to keep their children at home can do so without repercussions. But if it makes more sense for parents to send their child to school before Thursday, that’s OK, too.

“This is one of the reasons why we’re not closing right away,” Yniguez said. “We are giving parents and caregivers time to get their affairs in order before the upcoming school closure which starts Thursday.”

Some parents said the situation is causing added stress.

“It’s definitely a disruption to our schedules, so there is some stress too because we’re not sure how long this will last,” said Dalia Magana, 35, from Merced. The mother of three was picking up her 9-year-old child near Burbank Elementary in Merced on Monday.

Magana said that she relies on child care, but she is able to work from home.

She said local education officials made the right decision in closing the schools.

“It’s safety measures and I think that it’s the right thing to do even though we’ll all have to sacrifice. I think we all have to do our part and be OK with disruptions, be OK with stress because it’s going to keep other people safe.”

David Smythe, a junior at Merced High, also said he understood the need for closures. “But I can see how it’s kind of unfair to seniors, especially this is their last year at this school and it’s kind of being compromised by them closing the school down,” he said.

Nathan Quevedo, spokesperson for Merced County Office of Education, said MCOE received messages from parents about the school closures. Some parents had questions about childcare options and what the closure will mean for parents who work full time.

“We really hope to have more information and more resources available for our communities in the next 24 to 48 hours. I can say that we’re developing a webpage now, mcoe.org/covid19, that will link directly to these resources,” Quevedo said.

Quevedo also said there are plans to have a map on the website with information about school meal preparations, which will most likely be a grab-and-go style, in order to try and limit the social interaction between nutrition services staff and the community.

“We really have to think about there’s still people that will provide vital services in our schools and make sure that they’re safe and that we have the correct protective gear, that we’re not putting them in a dangerous situation, we’re being thoughtful about all of it,” he said.

Quevedo echoed Yniguez sentiments, saying for parents who don’t feel safe sending their children to school, attendance is optional for most districts until Thursday.

“If (children) are exhibiting flu-like symptoms or if they don’t feel good, or if you as a parent just don’t feel safe sending your child to school, we understand,” he said.",state_of_emergency,144117.0,37.3057,-120.4779

A local and public health emergency was declared Friday by the Merced County Office of Emergency Services and Department of Public Health in response to coronavirus concerns, according to a county news release.

Following the county’s declaration, the City of Merced also declared a state of emergency.

“The inevitable spread of this illness to our community makes it imperative that every resource is in place to assure that the most vulnerable individuals are protected to the fullest extent possible,” County Health Officer Dr. Kenneth Bird said in a news release.

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

Vulnerable individuals are defined as those over age 65, those with chronic illnesses and those with an impaired immune systems.

Merced County does not have any confirmed cases as of March 13, although many surrounding counties do.

The county’s emergency declaration came on the heels of President Donald Trump’s own declaration of a national emergency Friday. Enacting the Stafford Act, the proclamation authorizes FEMA to respond to COVID-19 and opens the country up to $50 billion in shared funding for states.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency March 4 as well.

The City of Atwater Monday was the first city in Merced county to proclaim an emergency situation.

The county’s emergency declaration increase access to funding, reimbursement and resources. It also expedites emergency response processes that can be slowed by local provisions or regulations.

“It’s essential to be prepared during a situation like this,” said Merced County Fire Department Division Chief Jeremy Rahn, who also serves as the OES Deputy Director.

“We want the public to be assured that we’re doing everything in our power to minimize impacts to our community. It’s important to be calm, but it’s also important to be ready for any potential future impacts.”

Officials continue to advise the public to avoid large gatherings, frequently wash their hands and stay home when ill.

“Keeping our communities and families safe requires a collective effort, which speaks to the foundation of public health and, moreover, speaks to the efforts the County of Merced requires from all its residents,” said County Public Health Director Rebecca Nanyonjo-Kemp.

Symptoms of COVID-19 include mild to severe respiratory illness, difficulty breathing, fever and cough.

The Board of Supervisors will vote on ratifying the emergency during a special meeting on March 16 at 1:30 p.m.

The emergency declaration will remain in effect until the Board of Supervisors decides it is no longer necessary, according to Merced County Public Information Officer Mike North. The normal time limit on local emergencies mandating supervisors vote to renew it after a set number of days has been waived.

County employee work schedules have not been changed, but the situation continues to be monitored, North said in a message to the Sun-Star. Essential meetings continue to be held, but non-essential meetings and those not conforming to state recommendations are being reevaluated or canceled.

Accurate information and resources can be found through the county, the World Health Organization and the Center for Disease Control.

City of Merced increases precautions

The City of Merced announced Friday that it too is taking extra preventative steps against coronavirus, according to a city news release.

“While we have declared a state of emergency, we want everyone to remain calm,” said Mayor Mike Murphy in the release. “This is a situation that will eventually pass and we will work through it.”

At Monday’s City Council meeting, council is expected to pass a resolution confirming the emergency.

City Spokesperson Mike Conway said Merced is following the county’s lead in waiting to declare a local emergency.

The council’s agenda also notes that a coronavirus update will be provided via a special presentation by Merced Fire Chief Billy Alcorn, who oversees the City’s Emergency Operations Center, and a County Public Health official.

While Merced City Council will continue to meet normally, attendees Monday will be greeted with a video advising them to maintain social distance during the meeting by sitting apart from others.

The Civic Center’s Sam Pipes Room will host a video feed of the council meeting and will be set up with chairs spaced six feet apart.

“We are following the recommendations and best practices that come from the health experts at Merced County, the State of California and the Centers for Disease Control,” said City Manager Steve Carrigan. “We urge everyone to avoid large gatherings of over 250 people and to practice social distancing.”

Council meetings are also streamed live on Facebook Live, Comcast and the city’s website.

The city will provide hand sanitizer outside the council chambers.

Although city employees have not yet been given the okay to work from home on a normal basis, Conway said the city is evaluating the situation daily.

City operations are undergoing a re-examination limit face-to-face interactions, the release says.

“We’re having more meetings by conference calls, we’re seeing if we can respond by text or email rather than meeting with people,” Carrigan said. “We’re trying to avoid non-essential contact.”",state_of_emergency,144117.0,37.3057,-120.4779

Monterey County on Friday declared a local emergency related to the COVID-19 coronavirus — though no cases have been detected in Monterey County.

The move was a precautionary measure taken to activate and coordinate resources, county officials said Friday.

A health event in Gonzales and the Sea Otter Classic at Laguna Seca have also been postponed because of the coronavirus.

""After careful consideration, and although we are not experiencing any active cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community, nor in Monterey County, we have decided to take the precautionary measure of postponing the Community Summit that was scheduled for this Saturday, March 7th at Gonzales High School to a future date,"" the city wrote in a letter.

Coronavirus is highly contagious respiratory virus that has infected more than 100,000 across the globe, including 260 in the United States. California has treated 70 people for the disease, according to the New York Times.

On Friday, Gonzales announced it would be pushing back the summit, which was planned to celebrate the city's selection for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health Prize from among 200 communities that applied.

The prize honored five communities for ""pursuing innovative ideas and bringing partners together to rally around a shared vision of advancing health, opportunity, and equity,"" according to a prior press release from Gonzales.

The event was supposed to run from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Gonzales residents would also receive free T-Mobile hotspots.

They're among the latest events cancelled across the United States because of COVID-19. Austin's SXSW music, film and technology festival was cancelled Friday because of the coronavirus, which is spreading across the world.

In addition, the virus has led to two cruise ships' passengers being quarantined at sea, including the the Grand Princess anchored about 100 miles from Monterey Bay.

The U.S. Coast Guard flew test kits out to the ship Thursday. Of 46 people tested, 21 tested positive, according to USA Today.

Most infected people have mild symptoms, but its fatality rate has bounced between 2% an 3.4%.

That concerns health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because it could easily spread among vulnerable populations.

At least 14 people have died across in the United States and more than 3,200 have died across the world.

Tips to protect yourself and others from coronavirus

This map shows the countries that have reported Coronavirus infections (Photo: PROVIDED/CDC)

The CDC has created a website dedicated to COVID-19.

It says the following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.*

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath

The CDC offers these tips for preventing COVID-19:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Impact: Salinas Chinese restaurant business dips slightly amid coronavirus outbreak

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, according to the CDC. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.

People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately, the CDC advises.

The city of Mountain View proclaimed a state of emergency Thursday afternoon in response to the new coronavirus, clearing the way for swift action against the spread of the virus and easier access to state and federal funds.

The announcement was quickly followed by closures of the Mountain View Senior Center and recreation facilities through April 5.

Mountain View joins numerous cities and counties in California to make the emergency declaration as the proliferation of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has become a global pandemic. There have been 66 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County, according to public health officials.

In the proclamation, City Manager Kimbra McCarthy wrote that the spread of COVID-19 has imposed ""extraordinary"" requirements and expenses on the city, causing it to divert resources away from day-to-day operations. It also means the city may have to pursue ""potential isolation and quarantines of residents, employees, businesses and public safety workers"" affected or exposed to the coronavirus.

The emergency declaration is effective immediately, and will stay active for the next seven days. This gives time for the City Council to ratify the the city manager's proclamation and extend the state of emergency.

Precautionary measures include a blanket cancellation of all city events through the end of the month, including the cancellation and postponement of performances at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts. Hand sanitizer stations have been placed at city facilities throughout Mountain View, and city staff are recommending that all residents frequently wash their hands and commonly used surfaces.

""The city's foremost priority is to maintain the health and safety of the community and our employees,"" Mayor Margaret Abe-Koga said in a statement accompanying the declaration.

On Friday, city officials announced that several sports recreation facilities will be shut down starting this weekend. The Mountain View Sports Pavilion, Whisman Sports Center and the public pools at Eagle Park and Rengstorff Park will be closed from March 14 through April 5.

Winter classes hosted by the city through the recreation department will be canceled from March 14 through the end of the winter session. A pro-rated refund will be given to customers with canceled class dates.

Prior to the state of emergency, numerous city programs and services had already been canceled, scaled back or modified to safeguard against the spread of coronavirus. Library events through March 14 had already been canceled, and the Senior Nutrition Program -- run by the nonprofit Community Services Agency of Mountain View and Los Altos (CSA) out of the city's senior center -- had shifted its popular daily lunch program to take-out meals-only.

As of Friday, city officials say that the senior center will now only be open from 11:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. for the Senior Nutrition Program -- effectively closing it for all other services through April 5. All evening rentals at the senior center from Monday through Thursday will be moved or canceled, while Friday and weekend evening rentals will be honored.

The city has also sought to use video conferencing or outright cancellations of in-person meetings deemed non-essential, and has modified any trainings and gatherings hosted by the city to include ""social distancing"" -- often described as a 6-foot buffer between individuals.

The proclamation shows escalating concerns about coronavirus, starting with the first reported county case on Jan. 31 and the first COVID-19 death in the county on March 9. That same day, county health officials had announced a ban on all mass gatherings of 1,000 people or more in Santa Clara County.

But the trigger for the city's emergency declaration was a pronouncement by the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic -- the first such announcement since the swine flu in 2009.

The city has also announced the following events have been canceled as of Friday morning:

● April 3 Concert on the Plaza

● April 4 Volunteer Fair

● April 17 Concert on the Plaza

● April 18 Deer Hollow Farm Spring Tour

By midday Monday, public health officials around the Bay Area had confirmed at least 258 cases of the virus, including at least four deaths. The Bay Area accounts for more than half of the confirmed cases across the state.

Seven Bay Area jurisdictions instituted a shelter-in-place order effective Tuesday through at least April 7 in an effort to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The order applies to residents in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Marin counties and the city of Berkeley.

In Napa County, a local public health emergency was declared last week by Napa County's health officer. Although there were no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus among Napa County residents as of Monday, leadership of all four cities have all now followed suit.



The risk of COVID-19 infection in Napa County appears to be moderate, according to public health officials.



""Health and safety of our community and employees is of utmost importance to all of us,"" Napa City Manager Steve Potter said. ""The responsibility to keep our community safe is taken very seriously by city staff.""



In an abundance of caution and in light of the state's recent direction — asking bars, brewpubs, nightclubs and wineries to close, as well as asking those over age 65 to self-quarantine — the Napa City Manager's Office is working to develop a path forward to respond to the evolving nature of COVID-19, according to a city news release.

Potter declared a local emergency to help local small businesses access funds available from the Small Business Association and other resources, and to provide greater authority to quickly respond to the changing nature of the situation.

The Napa City Council meeting Tuesday was canceled, but a special meeting was held Monday night for ratification of the city of Napa's emergency proclamation.

Likewise on Monday, St. Helena City Manager Mark Prestwich declared a local emergency while also calling for social distancing measures intended to reduce ""the exponential growth rates of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,"" according to a city news release.

Social distancing is a practice recommended by public health officials to stop or slow down the spread of contagious diseases. It requires the creation of physical space of at least 6 feet among people who may spread certain infectious diseases. Residents are strongly encouraged to practice social distancing in stores, restaurants and public spaces, and to avoid mass gatherings at this time.

St. Helena city residents 65 and older are encouraged to quarantine themselves and shelter at home.

In addition to California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling for the closure of bars, wine bars and brewpubs to help stop the spread of the virus, he also encouraged choosing take-out as a food option and asked restaurants to reduce their occupancy by half to keep people farther away from each other.



""As a city, we are working to balance continuing community services while also following guidance by health professionals to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" St. Helena City Manager Mark Prestwich said. ""Our essential services including police, fire and public works field operations will continue while City Hall and library services transition to this appointment-based approach for safety and social distancing reasons.""

In the city of Calistoga, the March 17 City Council meeting, the March 18 Mayor's Forum, the March 19 Council Goal Setting Workshop, and the March 25 Planning Commission meeting were all canceled.

All Calistoga City buildings are closed to the public with the exception of the police department lobby.



All Calistoga youth, young adult and senior recreation programs are suspended until March 31, including the Calistoga Community Pool and all aquatics programs. As previously reported, all Calistoga schools are closed through April 13. The Calistoga Boys & Girls Club is also closed.

The Calistoga Farmer's Market is closed through March 31.

The grocery store CalMart in Calistoga has instituted a phone-in and order pickup program for seniors and residents with medical conditions who are advised to home-quarantine. Deliveries are also being offered within 1 mile of the store. For information on the preorder program, call 707-942-6271.

In the city of American Canyon, all public meetings, gatherings and recreation programs have been canceled through April 12 — the lone exception being Tuesday's City Council meeting, which residents can watch on the city's YouTube Channel or its Facebook Page.

""Importantly, American Canyon remains open for business, albeit differently than before,"" City Manager Jason Holley said. ""While city facilities such as the treatment plants, Corporation Yard, Aquatic Center and Senior Center are now closed to the public, staff is still working at these locations to deliver services in new and different ways. Please continue to check for updates on our website for the latest information.""

The cities within Napa County are all in close contact with the Napa County Public Health Department, which is in contact with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the new coronavirus. Napa County is updating its coronavirus webpage with pertinent information about the coronavirus crisis.

Oakville Mayor Rob Burton made the announcement on Tuesday, March 24 in response to new statistics showing more than half of COVID-19 cases are now the result of locally spread transmission.

The declaration is intended to show residents just how serious the situation is and support Public Health officials’ efforts to “flatten the curve” and slow the spread of COVID-19.

The declaration states that, “The outbreak of a communicable disease namely COVID-19 coronavirus constitutes a danger of major proportions that could result in serious harm to persons.”

Town staff point out that under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act, the head of council may declare an emergency exists in the municipality and may take such actions and make such orders as he or she considers necessary, and are not contrary to law, to implement the emergency plan of the municipality and to protect property and the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the emergency area.

“Council and I are committed to ensuring we provide every support necessary to our community, our staff, and our regional public health officials during this very challenging time,” said Burton.

“Declaring a state of emergency is meant to emphasize to our community the serious challenge we are facing, and to encourage them to stay home and stay safe. We are continuing to work closely with our regional, provincial and federal partners and are following their lead on the precautions necessary to ensure containment and the safety and support of our residents.”

Over the last two weeks, the town has activated its Emergency Operations Plan, closed municipal parks and facilities, and cancelled programs.

The town’s business continuity plans were also activated in an effort to ensure essential services continue to be delivered.

Palm Desert City Hall and other municipal facilities are closed, effective at noon today, and will remain closed pending a public health risk reevaluation on April 3.

Police and fire protection, as well as other public safety related municipal services including

building inspections and code compliance, will continue without interruption. Responses to

Other Coachella Valley cities with local emergency declarations include Palm Springs, Indio and Cathedral City. Riverside County also has an emergency declaration in place.

""We have been working closely with Riverside County, the agency responsible for providing public health services in Palm Desert, on how to promptly and thoughtfully respond to the pandemic and the many challenges it poses. We will continue to quickly implement all directives from Riverside County Public Health, which has the expertise and authority to order closures that impact private businesses within the county,"" a news announcement from the city read.

The city of Palm Desert is encouraging the public to follow all health recommendations

PALM DESERT (CBSLA) — Palm Desert has become the latest city in the Coachella Valley to declare a local emergency due to the coronavirus outbreak.

On Tuesday, Palm Desert City Manager Lauri Aylaian issued a local emergency, closing city hall and other city buildings until at least April 3.

“Palm Desert cares deeply about the health and well-being of its residents, business community, visitors, and staff,” the city said in a statement. “We have been working closely with Riverside County, the agency responsible for providing public health services in Palm Desert, on how to promptly and thoughtfully respond to the pandemic and the many challenges it poses.”

Officials urged residents to utilize the city website to stay up to date on information related to COVID-19.

In nearby Palm Springs, the city council Tuesday directed City Manager David Ready to order to closure of all nonessential businesses that includes a shelter in place provision for residents.

On Sunday, the cities of Indio and Cathedral City issued emergency orders themselves, which did not mandate any businesses close, but adjusted city operations and postponed city-sponsored events.

A third Riverside County resident died from complications related to COVID-19, county health officials announced Tuesday. All three deaths have occurred in the Coachella Valley, but no other details were provided by the county health officials.

On Monday, Riverside County Public Health Officer Cameron Kaiser revised previous order restricting public gatherings from 250 people or greater to no more than 10.

The new health order restricts mass gatherings of 10 people or more, and orders that gatherings with fewer than 10 people must have enough available room to maintain six feet of space between attendees — known as social distancing.

Healthcare facilities, grocery stores, daycare centers and restaurants serving take-out are exempt from the rule.

“The disease curve must be flattened, and that’s why we’re already intervening as early as possible so that our vulnerable residents are protected,” Kaiser said.

Two new cases of COVID-19 were announced in western Riverside County Tuesday, which brings the county’s total cases to 16. Most of the county’s cases are in the Coachella Valley.

Additionally, Palm Springs City Manager David Ready issued an emergency order Sunday requiring all bars, night clubs and breweries within the city limits to close immediately.

The order comes hours after Gov. Gavin Newsom Sunday ordered that all bars in California close temporarily due to the coronavirus pandemic and directed restaurants to reduce their capacity by roughly half.

""Those restaurants that include a bar area may remain open, but must close the bar area of the restaurant. In addition, social distancing (defined as distancing tables to no less than six feet from each other) must be maintained in any restaurant that remains open,"" the Palm Springs order read.

The order also ""strongly encouraged"" people 65 and older or those vulnerable to COVID-19 to ""practice home isolation and should venture out only as absolutely necessary.""

The order provided police and city employees the power to enforce closures.

Ready issued a local emergency declaration Sunday that cited a need to reduce and the slow the rate of infections and exposure to the city's more then 44,000 residents, workers and visitors with special concern for a population that includes 40 percent aged 60 or older and at least 10 percent with compromised immune systems.

As of Monday morning, March 16, Riverside County has 15 confirmed COVID-19 cases — 13 in Coachella Valley and two cruise ship passengers who have not returned to the region since being diagnosed.

The city of Palm Springs declaration will need to be approved during Thursday's city council meeting, but Ready is already moving ahead with several related recommendations including:

— restricting public access at City Hall, effective Tuesday, with continued operations through alternative methods including using telephones, remote and online methods

— restricting public access and closing all other indoor city public facilities, effective Monday, as well as the Swim Center and Skate Park; outdoor parks will remain open

— asking all businesses and locations open to the public to limit occupancy by 50 percent of their current legal limit, effective immediately

— requiring all businesses to post signs at every entrance regarding recommended reductions in occupancy and explaining how guests can protect themselves and others along with other critical information.

In addition to seeking formal ratification of the emergency declaration Thursday, Ready said the council meeting will also focus on addressing issues related to the health emergency.

""I will continue to update and announce other measures to address the pandemic in ways to best protect our residents, workers and visitors,"" Ready said.

Those updates will be posted on the city's website: www.palmspringsca.gov

A local emergency was declared Friday in the city of Riverside based on the potential spread of coronavirus, mandating that all nonessential facilities, including Riverside City Hall, be shuttered for at least a week.

City Manager Al Zelinka unilaterally implemented the emergency declaration, which must be ratified by the city council, whose members are slated to convene for regular business at 6 p.m. Tuesday despite the closures, according to spokesman Phil Pitchford.

No known coronavirus cases have surfaced in the city.

While Riverside's emergency order does not impact public safety operations or the functions of utility personnel, other departments are affected, according to the city.

City of Riverside officials acknowledged that the declaration was spurred in part by President Donald Trump's national emergency declaration tied to coronavirus earlier Friday.

The city of Riverside has a dedicated COVID-19 information portal at https://RiversideCA.gov/COVID-19.

The city in a news release said its order is modeled on the one in effect in San Francisco.

As of Wednesday, Riverside County had reported three coronavirus fatalities and 16 cases of infection. The three deaths — two men and one woman from the Coachella Valley — were all older than 70. Two had underlying health problems, including the woman, who had spent time at a Rancho Mirage skilled nursing facility before she was hospitalized.

Dr. Michael Mesisca, medical director of the Riverside University Health System Medical Center, said all residents and employees of the Rancho Mirage Health and Rehabilitation Center, roughly 200 people, had been tested. Results are expected this week, but sor far no one from the facility has been hospitalized with virus symptoms.

County health officials have advised all skilled nursing facilities to restrict access to residents and instructed the staff of the Rancho Mirage home not to work at any other facilities.

Caretakers are washing their hands between interactions with patients, who are being closely monitored for fever, Mesisca said.

The Coachella Valley has a large elderly population, which is at a higher risk of falling seriously ill from the virus. Many of Washington state’s coronavirus deaths have been tied to a nursing home.

“We’re very concerned about Coachella Valley and across our elderly population,” Mesisca said.

The daughter of the woman who died Monday told the Desert Sun that her mother was being treated for leukemia and had spent some time at the nursing home before she was hospitalized.

Here is the Palm Springs order:

We need your support to continue our important work. Please join your neighbors and become a subscribing member today

With the number coronavirus cases in the county steadily climbing, the city of Palo Alto on Thursday declared a state of emergency, joining a growing number of jurisdictions preparing for the impacts of the spreading pandemic.

The proclamation of the emergency by City Manager Ed Shikada comes days after the city canceled more than 30 events, including town halls and civic ceremonies, to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The city has already canceled most of its public meetings and planned ceremonies, consistent with Santa Clara County's recommendations to encourage ""social distancing.""

Shikada also introduced numerous measures on Thursday aimed to limit face-to-face customer service interaction between the public and staff, including encouraging residents to call, email or make appointments with staff (the full list of changes is available here).

Shikada emphasized in a statement that the city ""will continue to provide essential services and community support through thoughtful planning for several impact scenarios during this time of heightened public health risk.""

""This is a fast-changing situation, and service changes may continue to evolve,"" Shikada said in the announcement. ""We have already taken several steps to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, including limited public gatherings according to the public health department's guidance. ...""

The Thursday declaration, as well as the new measures, intend to provide Palo Alto with ""flexibility in how we can respond to this changing crisis,"" Mayor Adrian Fine announced Thursday. The emergency declaration, he said, will help Emergency Services personnel ""secure vital supplies, funding and assistance."" Emergency declarations allow local jurisdictions to activate their emergency plans and become eligible for reimbursements from federal and state governments.

Palo Alto is one of many jurisdictions declaring a state of emergency, which comes the same day that Mountain View made a similar move and a day after the city of Santa Clara made its declaration. San Francisco and Santa Clara County previously declared a state of emergency in their respective jurisdictions.

More than 20 states, including New York, California and Washington, had also announced a state of emergency to combat coronavirus.

Shikada also announced on Thursday a series of service changes, most of which will take effect on March 16. Rinconada Pool was closed as of Thursday, the temporary Junior Museum and Zoo was set to close on March 13, and all Children's Theatre performances were postponed until June. Local libraries are disabling some computers to ensure ""social distancing"" between users and Development Center will only be accessible by appointment.

The City has discontinued police public tours and police and fire ride-a-longs and sit-a-longs. Patrol operations are also being modified for non-emergency police calls for service that can be completed via phone or video. Officers plan to limit face-to-face public contact and ensure social distancing of six feet when possible.

Other services that are typically provided over the counter, including revenue collections, and Residential Parking Permit programs, will now be offered by appointment, as well as by phone, email and online. And residents looking to attend Monday's meeting of the City Council are encouraged to instead submit their comments via email (those should be sent to city.council@cityofpaloalto.org) and to watch the live broadcast of the meetings rather than appearing in-person.

Residents who still want to attend are asked to sit at least six feet away from other people, to avoid shaking hands and to wait until the podium is clear to speak.

“This declaration is part of an ongoing response and will empower the city to more effectively respond to COVID-19 and prepare for community spread of the virus,” she said at a Wednesday morning press conference held alongside officials from Los Angeles city and county who issued their own public health emergency.

Goh said the move would allow Pasadena to more easily coordinate with regional partners and get the resources needed to fight the spread of the disease. She is expected to provide a briefing to the City Council at its next meeting.

The city of Long Beach also declared a public health emergency on Wednesday, following San Francisco and Orange County, which both made similar declarations last week. San Francisco has no cases of the virus while Orange County has three. Both Long Beach and Pasadena run their own public health departments separate from the county’s.

With seven total cases across Los Angeles county — six of which were reported in the past 48 hours — Barbara Ferrer, director of Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said leaders should expect more in the days ahead.

“If you’re sick with anything, we need people to stay home,” Ferrer said.

Still, Ferrer said there was no indication the disease was spreading through the community. All of the new cases appear to be contracted by individuals who traveled to areas where the disease was more prevalent, or the patients had direct contact with travelers.

As governments worldwide grapple with the fast-moving virus, the World Health Organization pegged the coronavirus’ global mortality rate at 3.4% on Tuesday, significantly higher than the mortality rate of the seasonal flu, which is 0.1% according to a news release.

Officials announced California’s first coronavirus-related death on Wednesday — a Placer County patient who tested positive for the virus after returning from a cruise to Mexico.

The patient was among the first diagnosed in the state; it was the first death outside of Washington state where 10 people have died from the disease as of Wednesday afternoon.

Governments across the country have advised anyone who is sick to stay home. They recommend washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water isn’t available, they’ve suggested using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.",state_of_emergency,142647.0,34.1597,-118.139

March 4, 2020

PASADENA, Calif.—On March 4, City of Pasadena Public Health Officer Dr. Ying-Ying Goh declared a Local Public Health Emergency to empower the City to more effectively respond to the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19. This declaration coincides with actions taken by Los Angeles County and Long Beach Health Department. Currently, there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Pasadena.

The declaration of a Local Public Health Emergency will mobilize City resources, accelerate emergency planning, streamline staffing, coordinate agencies across the city, facilitate seeking and utilizing mutual aid, and allow for future reimbursement by the state and federal governments. Additionally, an official declaration will help raise awareness about how everyone can prepare in the event that COVID-19 appears in our community. This declaration does not signify an immediate increase in risk to the residents of Pasadena.

""The City of Pasadena has been preparing to address cases of COVID-19 and taking action to prevent spread,"" said Dr. Goh. ""The Pasadena Public Health Department has been proactively working in coordination with partner jurisdictions and state and federal agencies to provide guidance to health care providers, schools and businesses, and deliver key public health functions to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.""

Steps that individuals can take to reduce the risk of getting sick with seasonal colds or flu can also help to prevent COVID-19 if it begins to circulate in the community:

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; if soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer;

Cover your cough or sneeze;

Stay home if you are sick;

Get your flu shot to protect against influenza; and

If you have recently returned from a country with ongoing COVID-19 infections, follow public health guidance and monitor your health. Call your healthcare providers and inform them about your travel history if you need care.

You can also prepare for possible disruptions to daily routines that could be caused by COVID-19:

Make sure you have a supply of all essential medications for your family;

Make a child care plan in case you or a care giver are sick;

Understand your employer's policies regarding leave and options for working from home;

Make arrangements for how your family will manage a school closure; and

Make a plan for how you can care for a sick family member without getting sick yourself.

Dr. Goh will provide a full update on local response to COVID-19 at the March 9 Council meeting. For the latest information on the coronavirus, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html.

McCaul, Peters, Engel, Guthrie, Eshoo, Hudson, Schrader, Bilirakis Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Prevent Critical Access Drug Shortages","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Michael McCaul (TX-10), Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52), Rep. Eliot Engel (NY-16), Rep. Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18), Rep. Richard Hudson (NC-08), Rep. Kurt Schrader (OR-05), and Rep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-12) introduced the bipartisan Preventing Drug Shortages Act, which would help address the critical issue of drug shortages that affect the quality of care patients receive across the country. The introduction of the bill comes days after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first U.S. drug shortage related to factory shutdowns and shipping problems in China due to the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

According to the FDA, in recent years drug shortages have steadily increased, and supply chains may become further stressed by the challenges associated with the new coronavirus outbreak. Most drug shortages stem from a supply chain interruption, often created by natural disasters, over-reliance on foreign pharmaceutical products, or manufacturing and distribution problems. These shortages threaten the adequate delivery of first-rate patient care, as deficiencies of drugs commonly used by hospitals to treat acute conditions, including bacterial infections and cancer treatment, can severely limit Americans’ access to lifesaving medicines.

The Preventing Drug Shortages Act would help mitigate these shortage triggers by enhancing transparency throughout the drug supply chain process and strengthening FDA interagency efforts to fend off drug shortages. The bill would also empower the FDA to enforce greater reporting standards on drug and active pharmaceutical ingredient makers to identify and correct vulnerabilities in their supply chains.

“Our country’s drug supply is heavily reliant on China, as we have seen in a recent drug shortage due to the Coronavirus outbreak. The Preventing Drug Shortages Act is a step in the right direction in addressing prevention, notification, and mitigation strategies not just in regards to China, but our entire drug supply chain,” said Rep. McCaul. “If a manufacturer has a contingency plan in place, and gives the FDA enough notice, the better the FDA can find alternatives to keep supply consistent. A patient should not be at risk because there was a failure of the supply chain.”

“Drug shortages under normal circumstances result in significant strain throughout our healthcare system—from patients to hospitals and physicians,” said Rep. Peters. “Unfortunately, the health emergency presented by COVID-19 is exacerbating these problems and we are already beginning to experience its adverse reactions on global drug supply chains. While we may never be able to predict or fully prevent the challenges posed by situations like the coronavirus outbreak, Congress should take steps to fortify drug supply chains. By strengthening efforts across the board to prevent drug deficiencies, my bill would help ensure America’s health centers have access to the proper resources they need so that patients can continue to receive reliable treatments.”

“As the number of coronavirus cases grows in New York, it’s critical that we take all proactive steps to ensure our health care providers have the medications to treat affected New Yorkers,” said Rep. Engel. “Many of our critical medications are sourced from China and India. The growing outbreaks in these countries and the first reported coronavirus-related drug shortage underscore the need to protect and secure our drug supply chain needs. I am pleased to help author this bipartisan legislation which will help mitigate these issues.”

“Whether it is an outbreak like the coronavirus, a natural disaster, or any number of possible interruptions to our drug supply chain, we need to ensure that Americans have access to lifesaving drugs at any time,” said Rep. Guthrie. “The Preventing Drug Shortages Act will increase transparency in our drug supply chain so we can better identify where our system can be improved. I want to thank Reps. Peters, Engel, Hudson, Eshoo, McCaul, Schrader, and Bilirakis for joining with me in introducing this bipartisan, commonsense legislation.”

“The coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated how susceptible our nation’s drug supply chain is to disruptions that could have devastating impacts on our public health because of our overreliance on China for generic drugs. The Coronavirus has already caused one shortage and it’s unclear if there are more to come,” Rep. Eshoo said. “This legislation takes some first steps to increase what information the federal government needs to receive from drug manufacturers about ongoing shortages and requires manufacturers to have risk management plans to mitigate the impact of drug shortages that affect the American people.”

“Too often I’ve heard from constituents and providers that access to lifesaving drugs has been interrupted because of a drug shortage. We cannot let this continue to happen, especially as new threats like coronavirus emerge,” said Rep. Hudson. “The Preventing Drug Shortages Act will bolster the data we have available to recognize these shortfalls earlier and eliminate potential shortages of lifesaving medications. I appreciate the partnership of Reps. Peters, Guthrie, Engel, Eshoo, Schrader, McCaul and Bilirakis in introducing this bipartisan legislation.”

“The drug supply chain is global and to ensure Americans have access to medicines, we must better understand where our drugs are coming from and how manufacturers will handle disruptions,” said Rep. Schrader. “This bipartisan bill will help to prevent prescription drug shortages by mitigating interruptions in the drug supply chain like we are seeing with the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Commonsense legislation like this ensures that Americans can access the medications that they need for themselves and their families.”

“Fortifying our drug chain will help ensure critical access to necessary medications, especially during emergency situations when the current system has often experienced strain,” said Rep. Bilirakis. “This common sense, necessary step is integral to protecting public safety and I urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort to expedite passage.”

Pismo Beach,CA,,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/coronavirus/article241249011.html,Pismo Beach CA declares local coronavirus emergency,"The city of Pismo Beach has declared a local emergency as the coronavirus outbreak continues to grow in San Luis Obispo County.

On Monday, San Luis Obispo County public health confirmed a third local resident has tested positive for COVID-19. The first confirmed case was in North County, but the two most recent cases originated in South County.

Pismo Beach declared a local emergency on Monday, according to a video shared by city manager Jim Lewis. It is the second city to do so in San Luis Obispo County.

Lewis said the declaration is a precaution “to ensure the city has the ability to fully protect the public.” It will give Pismo Beach access to state and federal funding to address the outbreak, and makes some city rules more flexible during the emergency, to allow for better response.

“The city is safe, but we need to do our part,” Lewis said in the video.

All essential city services will continue at this time, Lewis said.

City Hall is still open to the public, though residents are encouraged to use the online system or phone in whenever possible.

The City Council meeting scheduled for Tuesday will still take place, with public comment conducted through email. Some City Council members are expected to teleconference in to the meeting, though council chambers will remain open for the public to attend.

The city has also canceled all recreation programs, including classes, and closed its veterans halls, through March 31.

“Pismo Beach is a strong, resilient and well prepared community,” Lewis said. “I have confidence in our city team to put together the necessary steps to serve and protect those that live, work and visit in our city.”

As nationwide efforts mount to stem the spread of coronavirus, the Redding City Council on Tuesday night declared a local emergency.

""It provides us a better opportunity to be prepared,"" said City Manager Barry Tippin said. With that approval, Tippin is now authorized to coordinate planning, preparedness and response efforts regarding COVID-19.

Earlier Tuesday, Shasta County declared a local emergency in a 5 p.m. meeting of county officials along with representatives from the cities of Redding, Anderson and Shasta Lake.

Separately, the Redding Police Department said Tuesday morning it's making some immediate, temporary changes to how it dispatches non-emergency calls for services.

Redding's emergency designation allows the city to quickly purchase needed supplies that might be required without having to go through the traditional process of requesting bids.

""Once we declare an emergency, we can make quicker decisions in a faster time frame that are smart decisions for both our staff and our community,"" said Janelle Galbraith, who works in the City Manager's Office. As an example, she said, if the city's traditional supplier of hand sanitizer reports being out of stock, ""this allows us to go to several sources to go and find it.""

The council took up the issue during a special meeting that followed the council's regular meeting.

The emergency designation had to be approved by a four-fifths vote and opens the door for Redding to receive emergency aid from state or federal authorities. The council must re-approve the emergency designation every 14 days.

The city's action comes as the COVID-19 virus is being reported globally, including one confirmed case in Shasta County.

In response, state officials have urged people 65 and older as well as those who have other health conditions to remain at home. Gov. Gavin Newsom also has called for bars and restaurants to close, while President Trump has recommended the public avoid gatherings where more than 10 might attend.

Nearly every U.S. state, including California, have enacted states of emergency related to COVID-19, as have San Francisco, Fresno and other cities.

Redding is making other coronavirus information available on its website.

Changes at Redding police station

Chief of Police Bill Schueller assured residents the 911 system remains in service for emergencies.

""Our response to emergency calls will not change and will remain our top priority,"" an announcement from the department said.

However, all non-emergency calls for service — where a suspect is not present — will be handled by phone or through the department's online reporting system.

""Only after initial phone contact will an officer respond and only when absolutely necessary to do so,"" the department said.

The police department's lobby at City Hall will remain open, but fingerprinting services are being suspended due to concerns over sanitizing that equipment.

All training and meetings with more than 10 people are being canceled unless they're needed to protect public safety. Police ride-a-longs and building tours also have been cancelled.

The measures are being taken to lessen the risk of coronavirus exposure and spread of the virus and protect both the public and police department staff.

For more information, the department is directing residents to its website, reddingpolice.org, and to its social media channels on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The City also announced City Manager Joe Hoefgen is taking additional action to help safeguard the community and City employees with additional measures outlined below:

The Redondo Beach Libraries, both Main and North Branch, and all associated programs and meetings will be closed to the public until April 13. This is in parallel with the closure schedule announced by the Redondo Unified School District for all Redondo Beach public schools and may be extended.

The Redondo Beach Teen Center and City-operated after school programs will be closed during this same time period with possible extensions.

The three senior centers and associated programs are also closed.

Community events and certain activities of the Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center are postponed, and public facilities will receive additional cleanings.

The City of Redondo Beach said the above actions will help safeguard the community and limit the spread of COVID-19.

By decreasing the prevalence of COVID-19, the City of Redondo Beach said the community will:

Reduce the spread of COVID-19 before an effective treatment or vaccine is available.

Protect those most likely to experience severe symptoms, such as older individuals and those with underlying chronic conditions.

Minimize the social and economic impacts of COVID-19 over the long run.

There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:



Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC's recommendations for using a facemask. CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

The declaration also allows Redwood City officials to request mutual emergency aid from regional, state and other governmental entities.

Redwood City joins a growing list of Bay Area cities that have taken this step in light of the coronavirus outbreak, which has prompted limiting the number of people who can gather together, the closing of schools and some businesses and cancellation of many public events.

""While we understand that changes to city operations will cause some level of disruption, the health and safety of our community and employees must come first, and we want to ensure that we abide by all the guidance intended to protect us by public health officials,"" said Redwood City Mayor Diane Howard.

All four Redwood City public libraries will be closed to the public effective Monday, through Tuesday, March 31. All library meeting room reservations for these dates will be cancelled, and refunds will be available for all paid rentals. The library will offer telephone assistance from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday-Friday during the closure by calling (650) 780-7018, ext. 4.

The city's Community Activities Building, Red Morton Community Center and Sandpiper Community Center will be closed to the public effective Monday, through Tuesday, March 31. A modified schedule will continue for the Veterans Memorial Senior Center for the senior lunch to-go program.

Fair Oaks Community Center will remain open to provide essential services to the community, including homelessness services. Signs will be placed at all parks to remind community members to be vigilant by covering your cough and sneeze, washing your hands frequently, avoid shaking hands and touching your face with unwashed hands.

Effective Tuesday, through March 31, city hall will be open to visitors only by appointment. Every attempt should be made to conduct city business via phone, email and/or online. If it is absolutely necessary for a person to visit city hall in-person for an essential service, an appointment will be required. City staff will set-up a time to retrieve hard copy documents from the public and will contact a member of the public at a later date via email or phone to discuss additional comments. In-person consultations will not take place during this time.

Sacramento,CA,,https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/health-and-medicine/article240941561.html,Sacramento County CA declares emergency amid coronavirus,"Note: The Sacramento Bee and McClatchy news sites have lifted the paywall on this developing story, providing critical information to readers. To support vital reporting such as this, please consider a digital subscription.

Sacramento County declared both a public health emergency and a local emergency Thursday, assuring that its public health team will receive the funding and appropriate resources to respond to the new coronavirus.

“Our intent in proclaiming a state of emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19 is to ensure uninterrupted access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission,” said Supervisor Phil Serna, chairman of the Board of Supervisors. “The proclamation should not be considered a reason for elevated concern; in fact, it is quite the opposite as it helps us in our mission to contain the virus.”

Sacramento County has reported three confirmed cases of coronavirus, and one of those has recovered. The local proclamation follows the Wednesday announcement by California Gov. Gavin Newsom that he was declaring a state of emergency. Local governments will qualify for expanded federal and state funding only if they make these proclamations.

Local news has never been more important To support vital, local reporting like the coronavirus coverage, please sign up for a digital subscription to sacbee.com #readlocal

Sacramento County continues to work closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the California Department of Public Health on coordinated testing, investigations and providing guidance and assistance to health providers in monitoring for acute respiratory illness and gathering information to detect new cases for laboratory testing and confirming infection. The new coronavirus, the seventh zoonotic pathogen from this family to spill over into humans, causes fever, coughing and shortness of breath.

As public health officials continue their work to contain the virus, a growing number of local residents are receiving notices that the agency has put people in their sphere into self-isolation. On Thursday, for instance, parents of children at Leonardo da Vinci K-8 School received an email from Sacramento City Unified School District telling them a family in the school was exposed to COVID-19 and has been asked to remain at home.

“At this time, no one in the family has any symptoms,” said Deon Davis, the school’s principal. “Out of an abundance of caution, a dedicated team from the district facility department was assigned to deep clean the entire campus last night. Sacramento County Public Health has reassured us that all school activities should continue as normal.”

These announcements came as the numbers of cases continue to rise across California. Four more cases were reported Thursday in Los Angeles County, which on Wednesday declared a local emergency. The four were part of a group of travelers announced by health officials Wednesday who were in northern Italy. The number of Los Angeles County cases is now 11.

Two coronavirus cases were also announced in San Francisco, where health officials say the two new cases were likely through community transmission of COVID-19.

“We do not know at this time how they were exposed to the virus, which suggests it is spreading in the community,” health director Dr. Grant Colfax said in a statement. “We expected that to happen and are further investigating the circumstances of these patients’ exposure.”

The patients are not related and have not traveled to locations with confirmed COVID-19 cases, health officials said as San Francisco Mayor London Breed urged calm. Breed, who last week declared a local health emergency, said her city has been “increasing resources and staffing to prepare for the community spread of this virus.”

The patients are being treated in isolation at two different San Francisco hospitals, city officials said in a statement earlier Thursday. One of the patients, identified by San Francisco city officials as a man in his 90s, is in serious condition. The second patient, a woman in her 40s, is in fair condition. Both were tested Wednesday by a San Francisco Department of Public Health lab.

San Francisco is also where the Grand Princess, the cruise ship that carried the Placer County man who became the first to die of the virus at a Roseville hospital, is off shore and, for now, forbidden to dock.

The U.S. Centers and Disease Control and Prevention, state health and emergency services officials and the U.S. Coast Guard are checking if COVID-19 is present aboard the Grand Princess.

There is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, but public health officials recommend practicing these habits to prevent it:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Stay home if you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue. Throw used tissues in the trash immediately.

After requests via emails and speakers flooded the council Wednesday, members also directed officials to establish an eviction moratorium during the crisis, as recently proposed by Gov. Gavin Newsom.

City Manager Teri Ledoux said the emergency declaration will allow her “to make important decisions and take action in this ever-changing environment.”

She will be able to make regulations on matters related to the protection of life and property as affected by the emergency conditions; obtain supplies to protect public health and safety; and manage city staff to ensure essential functions continue while employees are protected.

The eviction ban will follow procedures outlined by the governor, which currently last through May 31. The city also announced it would not disconnect anyone’s utility service during the outbreak if they can’t pay.",state_of_emergency,216995.0,34.1417,-117.2945
San Joaquin,CA,03-17-2020 00:00,https://www.recordnet.com/news/20200317/san-joaquin-county-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus,San Joaquin County declares emergency over coronavirus,"Number of confirmed cases of coronavirus now at 13.

STOCKTON San Joaquin County declared a local emergency Tuesday morning related to COVID-19, the new coronavirus, which has infected 13 county residents to date. It’s a step beyond the local health emergency previously declared that will allow the county to provide additional support to Public Health Services and other agencies seeking assistance.

""It does potentially provide additional sources of funding for expenses that have been incurred,"" said Office of Emergency Services Director Marcia Cunningham, explaining that it puts the mechanism in place to account financially for the costs the agencies experience as a result of dealing with the virus.

That in turn will allow the county to seek reimbursements through state and federal channels.

Cunningham declared the local emergency at 9:41 a.m. Tuesday during a special meeting of the county Board of Supervisors. The board has seven days to ratify the declaration, which they are expected to do at their regularly scheduled meeting next week.

Cunningham told supervisors that five of the county’s seven cities Lathrop, Lodi, Manteca, Stockton and Tracy had previously declared local emergencies in their jurisdictions.

The county has implemented the Multi Agency Coordination group, also known as MAC, to bring all the cities and the county together Wednesday ""to discuss a common approach"" to the current crisis.

Above all, Cunningham said, ""We all need to remain calm."" She also emphasized the importance of each individual taking care of themselves, washing hands, keeping areas clean and avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.

During Tuesday’s special meeting, the board conducted business with no members of the public in the audience. While they weren’t banned from the chamber, the public was ""strongly encouraged"" to stay away and watch the meeting live online.

About a dozen public comments came in by email during the meeting that were read aloud by the board clerk and responded to by supervisors and county officials.

Complying with what is becoming the new normal, seating behind the dais was arranged to allow supervisors, the board clerk and the county administrator to sit 6 feet apart. County Counsel Mark Myles, who usually sits behind the dais, sat alone at the staff table in front of the supervisors.

In the single vote the board took on Tuesday, they unanimously ratified interim Health Officer Dr. Maggie Park’s earlier declaration of a local health emergency throughout the county.

Park told supervisors what is known about the 13 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county: there have been no deaths as a result of the virus; all the patients are adults (no children have tested positive); three are travel-related; two are from household contact, also referred to as person-to-person spread; and two are community spread. She did not know the source of the other six cases.

County Public Health has moved from a containment strategy tracking all possible exposures to the virus and quarantining people to a mitigation strategy.

""Due to the increased volume of cases, and the fact that we now know we have community spread, we have moved into the mitigation phase which is basically telling people if you have flu-like symptoms to stay home and self-isolate,"" Park said.

""Once you have community transmission, we longer actually issue those quarantine orders because we have other work to do as far as continuing surveillance and messaging and providing guidance. So it is all self-monitoring at this point,"" she said.

Concern about the county’s inventory of critical supplies needed to deal with the virus was addressed by Emergency Medical Services Director Dan Burch, who said that a cache of personal protective equipment (protective gowns, face shields) and respirators have been dispersed to ""community partners"" including hospitals and pre-hospital agencies including fire departments and ambulance companies.

""We were able to immediately offer that assistance to those entities so they could ramp up their own supply chain issues. We are continuing to process those requests to assist but now we have to send those requests to the state and access the state cache,"" Burch said, noting it is a slower process.

Large health care providers such as Kaiser Permanente, Dignity Health (St. Joseph’s Medical Center) and American Medical Response (AMR ambulance) have their own supply chains that are still working, according to Burch

The EMS agency has also planned for and stocked up on hospital beds that can be deployed to the county’s seven acute-care hospitals based upon a study of available ""surge space"" at each hospital, such as conference rooms and hallways, should the need arise.

Supervisors were also told that the Office of Emergency Services has activated its Joint Information Center, bringing together public information officers and representatives from 32 agencies countywide in order to provide consistent messaging to the public.

The primary sources of information recommended were two county websites: SJReady.org and SJCPHS.org. Information and assistance is also available by calling 2-1-1 or (209) 468-3411. Residents who believe they have symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough or difficulty breathing — should call their health care provider first.

With the new order issued by the county health officer restricting hospital visitation, supervisors called upon San Joaquin General Hospital CEO David Culberson to discuss activities at the county-run public hospital in French Camp.

Culberson explained that more telemedicine consultations are being conducting each day in an effort to limit face-to-face contacts between providers and patients.

""We are substantially ramping back visits. It was up to half as many on Monday,"" he said.

And while there have been some staff exposures to patients with the virus he did not say how many half tested negative and the other half are still pending test results.

Since last week, Culberson has met every afternoon with the hospital’s infection control practitioner, medical staff leadership, ancillary support and nursing teams to analyze current patients or those who have come through that have been tested or may need to be tested.

Training has been implemented as more is learned about the virus. Every morning, Culberson said, a current inventory of supplies such as face masks and gowns is conducted in light of some shortages over the past few weeks, but what has helped is that San Joaquin County is a Northern California distribution hub for many critical medical supplies.

And while the hospital has upgraded its ventilators, required by patients with critical symptoms, it has retained its older ventilators that can be used as demand increases.

""On Monday, we established a drive-thru clinic. It is by appointment only. We have to have a virtual visit on a telephone first with a provider before we can make an appointment. We saw 25 patients (Monday) and I’m told demand is pretty high today,"" Culberson said.

He made it clear that the hospital drive-thru clinic operating between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is not for asymptomatic patients. They first must consult with a doctor before being referred for testing.

Park discussed the county’s current testing capacity, noting the Public Health lab is only able to process 60 tests per day. That is changing however, as more private clinical laboratories are coming on line to process the tests for the coronavirus.

San Ramon,CA,03-18-2020 11:26,https://patch.com/california/sanramon/coronavirus-emergency-declaration-issued-san-ramon,Coronavirus: Emergency Declaration Issued In San Ramon,"SAN RAMON, CA — The City of San Ramon issued Tuesday evening a Proclamation of Emergency related to the new coronavirus. The move will make it easier for the city to respond with minimal impact to services it provides and get reimbursed for its virus response efforts, the city said.

Public health officials said 39 Contra Costa County residents have tested positive for the virus.

The City Council is expected to ratify the proclamation this week, the city said.

(Read the proclamation below.)

Don't miss updates about precautions in San Ramon as they are announced. Sign up for Patch news alerts and newsletters here.



Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency to provide additional resources, prevent price gouging and help the state better prepare for the virus's spread.

The emergency declaration followed the first known coronavirus-related death in California — an elderly Placer County resident who was exposed to the virus on a Grand Princess cruise Feb. 11-21 from San Francisco to Mexico and back.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that include the common cold as well as much more serious diseases. The strain that emerged in China in late 2019, now called COVID-19, is related to others that have caused serious outbreaks in recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on Jan. 21.

The disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.

According to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.

To avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Santa Barbara,CA,,https://www.noozhawk.com/article/santa_barbara_county_declares_public_health_emergency_for_coronavirus,Santa Barbara County Declares Public Health Emergency for Coronavirus,"Santa Barbara County officials declared a public health emergency Thursday evening as they continued to monitor for signs that the deadly novel coronavirus had made its way to the area.

Thus far, no cases of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, have been found locally, according to Van Do-Reynoso, the county’s public health director, who spoke at a press briefing at the County Administration Building in Santa Barbara.

Six people have been tested and cleared — five on the South Coast and one in the North County — and nine others currently are in home quarantine and are being monitored by Public Health personnel, said Paige Batson, the county's deputy director for community health.

In addition to declaring a public health emergency, the county has issued a health officer order calling for all gatherings of 250 people or more to be postponed or canceled.

Beyond that, officials are calling for “social distancing” in most other settings — including directing people to stay at least six feet apart in smaller gatherings.

That order will be in effect until March 30, when it will be reviewed.

Meanwhile, the county has set up a public information line for the coronavirus: 833-688-5551.

It will be open until 10 p.m. Thursday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, and probably over the weekend.

As of Thursday evening, Public Health personnel have monitored 61 people, Batson said.

""All have been cleared,"" Batson said.

Seventeen labs in California are conducting coronavirus testing, including in San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties, according to Batson.

""While testing has been expanded,"" Batson said, ""it's important for everyone to know there is still certain criteria that needs to be met for persons to be tested, because we have to prioritize those that are at greater risks of having adverse outcomes.""

COVID-19 testing is ""not necessarily going to be offered or provided upon request,"" Batson said.

Second District county Supervisor Gregg Hart said local government ""is doing everything we can to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus...This is the time we must all act in the best interest of our community and work together to contain this virus.""

The guidelines to be implemented are in alignment with the California Department of Public Health’s most recent guidelines issued Thursday regarding social distancing and public gatherings.

""Even though we have zero cases in Santa Barbara County,"" Do-Reynoso said, ""we are taking these two actions because of the declaration recently by the World Health Organization that COVID-19 is a pandemic, and also because of the recent California Department of Public Health issuance of recommendations on social distancing.

""The health officer order provides firm perimeters for canceling or postponing group gatherings that are nonessential, professional, social and community gatherings. Mandating social distancing is timely, and a proven strategy in prior pandemics.""

Dr. Henning Ansorg, the county's public health officer, said, ""It's ""essential that we implement social distancing as it's the most effective way to slow the spread of disease.

""To protect public health and slow the rate of transmission of the coronavirus in our area, we are implementing measures that are proven to be very effective during previous epidemics and pandemics, and delaying the rate of infection and reducing illness and death.""

Gatherings of people ""who are at the highest risk of severe illness"" of COVID-19 ""need to be limited to no more than 10 people,"" Ansorg said.

Jan Koegler, manager of the county Public Health Department’s emergency preparedness program, said Public Health personnel are communicating with local skilled-nursing facilities and assisted-living providers.

""These are facilities that serve some of our most vulnerable residents,"" Koegler said. ""Many of them have already implemented restrictions on visitors and restrictions on activities for their residents to prevent the spread of disease.""

Public Health personnel also are working with senior service providers and the Area Agency On Aging to coordinate information to keep seniors living independently safe, as well as ensure senior meals continue ""even though some of the senior activity centers will limit their activities now due to the need to provide social distancing,"" Koegler said.

She added that county environmental health service staff are working on procedures and guidance for restaurants ""so they can continue to operate given the instructions for groups and for staying six feet distance from each other.""

County officials hope to have details on Friday, Koegler said.

The county also issued a local proclamation of emergency, said Kelly Hubbard, director of the Office of Emergency Management.

""The local proclamation gives us the opportunity to coordinate with our community partners and the Public Health Department, and utilize our resources available,"" Hubbard said.

Also Thursday night, in a hastily called meeting, the Solvang City Council unanimously adopted measures related to the public health concern, adopting the county public health order, authorizing staff to pull the Solvang Century bike ride permit for routes through the city, and directing staff to work with local businesses to mitigate the economic impact.

The city’s motion also authorized the mayor to send a letter to state and federal representatives seeking financial assistance.

Council members had expressed concerns about the impact on its small businesses and city funding, which heavily relies on tourist spending.

“The fact that all these go into effect until March 30 to me is extremely optimistic, and I sure hope this is the case because this could be huge,” Councilman Robert Clarke said.

The announcement was made Friday afternoon after a closed session meeting with council members and city staff at City Hall.

“Santa Clarita is going to approach our response in a measured way with public health and safety as our top priority,” said Santa Clarita Mayor Cameron Smyth. “And that is why the council will declare a state of emergency. That will allow the city to access federal funds that have recently been made available by the president’s actions.”

The order, which took effect immediately, is expected to last “until its termination is proclaimed by the City Council of the city of Santa Clarita, California,” the proclamation read. “Such determination shall be revisited by the City Council no less frequently than every 60 days until deemed no longer necessary.”

Starting Saturday and for a period of 14 days, the city will suspend all nonessential city services, and close city facilities, such as in-person services at City Hall, libraries and youth and adult sports programming. There will be no impact on essential public safety services including from law enforcement, as well as public transportation, street crews and building and safety.

All city events scheduled through April are canceled, including the Sister Cities Hike event that was scheduled Sunday, the Senses Block parties on Main Street, the Cowboy Festival (April 18-19) and Earth Arbor Day (April 25).

The March 24 City Council meeting has also been canceled and council members expect to reconvene in April.

The local emergency came just hours after President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency as the nation continues to fight against the COVID-19 coronavirus. Last week, Los Angeles County proclaimed a local emergency.

On Friday, health officials with Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital confirmed the first case of COVID-19 in Santa Clarita after a patient tested positive.

As it has in the past, due to the city not having its own department of public health, Santa Clarita will continue to follow guidelines throughout the local emergency as prescribed by the state and county.

“The city will continue to push out critical information as well as share resources through our emergency website at santaclaritaemergency.com,” said Smyth.

Residents can also call 661-259-2489 between the hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

Meanwhile, Apple announced overnight that it is closing all of its stores outside of China -- including at least 20 in Southern California -- until March 27.

The Santa Monica Proclamation, issued late Friday by City Manager Rick Cole, cites the city's 90,000 residents, its status as a major tourist and business destination and proximity to the city of Los Angeles as factors making it likely there will be more cases there in the coming days.

""Coronavirus is almost certainly coming to Santa Monica,"" the proclamation says in part. ""The spread of the coronavirus underscores our increased interconnectedness and why we are not immune to a global pandemic.

""Santa Monica will continue to monitor the situation closely and work with L.A. County Department of Public Health to implement all recommended public health measures as directed. Santa Monica has an all-hazards plan for all emergency events and has plans in place for pandemic events.""

The Santa Monica Apple store employee received ad positive diagnosis on Thursday, company officials said, but had not worked since March 2 while at home caring for a sick relative. Still as a precaution, the store underwent a deep cleaning before opening Friday.

But overnight, Apple issued a statement announcing plans to close all of its stores for two weeks.

""Apple's first priority -- now and always -- is the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities we serve,"" the statement said. It cited the company's experience with stores in China, where early cases of the disease were first noted in late December and what it learned from the experience.

""One of those lessons is that the most effective way to minimize risk of the virus's transmission is to reduce density and maximize social distance. As rates of new infections continue to grow in other places, we're taking additional steps to protect our team members and customers.""

While the stores are closed, officials said each would undergo deep cleaning and have new health and temperature screenings installed.

Employees will continue to be paid and will have additional options for taking extra time off. Consumers will be able to obtain customer service by telephone and online.

Nova Scotia has declared a public state of emergency as people ignored government warnings to limit gatherings and practice social distancing.

At a press briefing on Sunday, Premier Stephen McNeil said people are continuing to gather in large numbers at beaches and parks, which he says is not acceptable and can be harmful.

Strang said if individuals haven’t travelled and are adhering to social distancing, then they can go for a walk, but “don’t pile into a car and crowd onto a beach or a park.”

However, the province said there are several groups who are essential and exempt from gathering limits. They include but are not limited to grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies.

“If possible, one person per family should be designated to do these tasks,” the province stated.

Other groups who are essential include construction sites, health-care services, community services, criminal justice services and law enforcement.

The province has also announced new orders, which are now in effect under the Health Protection Act.

Effective immediately, social gatherings of more than five people are prohibited, said the government.

Moreover, any workplace or business that is not deemed essential can remain open as long as a two-metre or six-foot distance can be maintained.

Workspaces must also be cleaned and disinfected at a minimum of twice daily or as required and employees follow proper hygiene.

“Everyone is at some risk, but we all have people who are at the highest risk of getting sick. We all have healthcare workers who continue put themselves at risk to treat people with this disease,” said Strang.

“So we all need to work together to protect those most vulnerable in our system and protect our healthcare workers. I can’t stress this enough.”

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials say the risk is low for Canadians but warn this could change quickly. They caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. And if you get sick, stay at home.

There were 242 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in San Diego County as of March 24, according to county data. More than half of those cases involve people ages 20 to 49, but people who are 65 and older, or those who have underlying conditions, face the highest risks of serious illness or death. There have been two coronavirus-related deaths in San Diego County.

As of March 25, there were 737 deaths in the United States and 54,453 positive cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Globally, the number of cases has surpassed 400,000, according to the World Health Organization.

To help reduce the spread of the global pandemic, state and local officials have closed or limited many businesses, including restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues. Solana Beach City Councilman Dave Zito said the city should explore ways to help them weather the economic standstill. Those plans would likely involve state and federal assistance.

“It’s going to be quite a challenge for them, I think,” Zito said.

President Trump has already signed one relief bill that provides paid sick and family leave for some workers. Congress is also expected to approve a $2 trillion stimulus bill that includes loans to businesses, expanded unemployment benefits and direct payments to most adults.

Zito and City Councilwoman Kristi Becker were the only two council members who attended the meeting in person. The other three participated by phone. Seating for the public was limited in order to properly space chairs for social distancing, but only a few city officials were in the audience.

Council members mentioned some of the other meetings that they’ve participated in remotely.

“It helps all of us feel connected to our jobs and each other,” Deputy Mayor Judy Hegenauer said.

They also discussed keeping local residents informed through the city website and social media updates.

Future council and commission meetings have been suspended until further notice. Solana Beach City Hall is closed to the public, but city personnel is still accessible by phone and email. Some staffers will be working from home.

Essential city services, including law enforcement and public works, will continue. Grocery stores will remain open. There will be no changes to garbage and recycling collection.

Local health officials urge practicing good hygiene to reduce the risk of becoming infected with a respiratory virus, such as the flu or coronavirus. This includes:

Amid fears about a widening presence of novel coronavirus in Sonoma County, the Board of Supervisors finalized a local public health emergency Wednesday as health officials step up efforts to locate 78 local residents who may have been exposed to the disease during a San Francisco-based cruise to Mexico.

Those Sonoma County residents were among 2,600 passengers on the Grand Princess ship that returned to San Francisco Feb. 21 after a 10-day cruise. Twenty-five shared a shuttle trip from San Francisco back to Sonoma County Airport.

The move comes as the county ratchets up emergency preparations to control the spread of a virus that still is not entirely understood.

The county currently has two confirmed cases of the virus, known as COVID-19. Both patients are hospitalized in isolation, though county officials have declined to say where.

But “we now believe that there a number of other people in our community that have been exposed, and so we’re trying to identify who those folks are,” Sonoma County Health Officer Celeste Philip told supervisors during an emergency meeting Wednesday.

Partial activation of the county emergency operations center already has begun, and the county is establishing a 211 hotline intended to help residents find answers to pressing questions, Emergency Management Director Christopher Godley told supervisors.

But the county already is at a disadvantage in its efforts to gain control of the virus, in that it is still awaiting the delivery of test kits from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and so is limited in the capacity and speed with which it can attempt to detect the virus, Philip said.

She said she hoped the county receives some test kits later this week, which would reduce lag time between a patient’s expression of symptoms and confirmation of the virus. But for the moment, specimens from patients showing signs of infection have to be sent to a state lab in Richmond or a CDC lab in Atlanta for testing, she said.

That makes it critical for residents to focus on practices “that we know prevent spread of disease,” such as social distancing, hand washing and telecommuting, Philip said.

She and Godley said local medical and emergency officials had been monitoring the growth of coronavirus since long before the first cases began appearing in the United States, largely through the transfer of patients from a Diamond Princess cruise that had been quarantined in Japan until late February, when American passengers were returned to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County and Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.

One of the patients from Travis Air Force Base who tested positive for the virus but never developed symptoms was transferred Feb. 24 to a hospital in Sonoma County, where the person remains asymptomatic, according to Rohish Lal, public information analyst with the Sonoma County Department of Health Services.

A second patient believed to have contracted the virus on a Grand Princess cruise ship voyage from San Francisco to Mexico Feb. 11-21 fell ill later and also is hospitalized in Sonoma County, health officials said. That person is in stable condition, Lal said Wednesday.

They are among at least 53 confirmed cases in California, where the first confirmed fatality included another Grand Princess passenger from Placer County, who died at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Roseville on Wednesday, officials said.",state_of_emergency,34089.0,38.2902,-122.4598

SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. — The City of South Lake Tahoe declared a local emergency Thursday morning in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

The city is taking this step to keep the public and employees as safe as possible and also to make it easier to receive mutual aid from other districts and to help secure resources, funding and staffing, states a press release.

In accordance with Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Executive Order, the local emergency proclamation also includes a moratorium on some residential evictions until the end of the local emergency or May 31, whichever is earlier.

There have been no reported cases of COVID-19 in El Dorado County as of Thursday about noon.

This moratorium is intended to help tenants who have lost income or incurred medical costs because of COVID-19 from being evicted if they are not able to pay rent during this local emergency, states the release.

“This is a time for action to help our residents and ensure we can work closely with partners around the basin,” said Mayor Jason Collin. “This emergency declaration is just one step. City staff and City Council have worked tirelessly to ensure the safety of our community during this crisis. That work will not stop.”

Most in-person services are suspended but employees are available through telephone and email. All city offices are prepared to have employees whose job duties allow work from home, and in fact some already are. Essential services, police, fire, public works, will not be suspended.

“Public safety and employee safety are our top priorities, but we also understand how important it is to continue to provide the essential services that also ensure safety,” said Interim City Manager Brad Kilger, “Our goal is to help South Lake Tahoe weather this crisis and we know this community will do just that.”

A 24/7 Barton COVID-19 Health Line, 530-600-1999, has been established for the general public to call if experiencing symptoms of respiratory illness such as fever, coughing, sneezing, or shortness of breath.

Health Line callers can ask questions and be scheduled for screening, testing and medical care at Barton’s referral-only respiratory screening center.

This standalone facility was recently opened to provide a safe screening location, increasing access to services for those in need while minimizing exposure to others, if referred by a medical provider.

The city is encouraging people to stay home if at all possible. We are also encouraging visitors who are considering vacationing in Tahoe to put those plans on hold for the foreseeable future.

“We love our visitors, but for the health of this community we need to ask people to hit pause on their vacations and their day trips,” said Collin, “We will weather this storm but now is the time for everyone to stay home and stay safe.”

Stockton,CA,03-12-2020 00:00,https://www.recordnet.com/news/20200312/stockton-declares-state-of-emergency-due-to-coronavirus,Stockton declares state of emergency due to coronavirus,"STOCKTON — The city of Stockton issued a proclamation Thursday declaring a public health emergency out of “an abundance of caution” regarding the possible spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.

Declaring a proclamation allows the city to take actions and access the resources needed to address the threat of COVID-19 within Stockton, according to a statement released by the city Thursday.

Both San Joaquin and Calaveras counties announced their first cases of the novel coronavirus Tuesday. Two more San Joaquin cases were announced Thursday afternoon.

Stockton will follow the recommended guidelines set forth by the governor and state public health officials regarding mass gatherings to help limit unknown exposure to the disease. Other organizations across the county have already announced this week they plan to cancel mass events, and area colleges have opted to move most of their classes to online.

“Our concern is for the health and safety of the community, our employees and their families,” City Manager Harry Black said in the statement. “Like many other cities and states, we want to make sure that we are doing everything that we can to limit the spread of coronavirus and keep people safe.”

Gatherings with 250 people or more should be postponed or canceled, the city says. It also advises social distancing of 6 feet per person at smaller gatherings, and recommends that individuals who have a higher risk of severe illness from the coronavirus should limit attending gatherings of more than 10 people.

“I want to reassure our residents that we are closely monitoring developments around the coronavirus and we will continue to communicate with the public as updates become available,” Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs said in a statement. “It is important that each of us continue to wash our hands, avoid touching your face and stay home if you are feeling sick.”

The city will continue to evaluate how the public health emergency is impacting city-provided services and the community, as well as provide guidance to city departments, officials say. The proclamation and corresponding policies will be evaluated on a rolling 30-day basis.

Non-essential city services, activities and events could be postponed, canceled, reduced in size, provided on a limited basis or changed to limit the number of people and reduce contact, city officials say. Any changes to delivery services or hours of operation will be posted on the city’s website, as well as at physical city locations and offices.

All services deemed essential, such as fire, police and water, will continue to function at full capacity, Black said in the city’s statement.

Both Stockton fire and police departments say members of their agencies receive training throughout their careers on how to utilize protective gear and protocols when dealing with calls involving communicable diseases. The departments will also provide regular updates and continual training as the threat of COVID-19 evolves.

Firefighters always wear personal protective equipment on medical calls, such as latex gloves, said Stockton Fire Marshal Shannon Lewis. The Fire Department is currently conducting a six-hour training class related to San Joaquin County EMS Agency protocols, which will include guidance regarding COVID-19.

If any calls are suspected to involve cases of the novel coronavirus, firefighters will also wear gowns, eye protection and N95 masks, Lewis said. Fire Department personnel have also been asked to practice social distancing.

In San Jose, one firefighter has tested positive for COVID-19, prompting the testing of a second firefighter and the quarantining of 75 others, officials in that city said.

Officers will be equipped with extra masks and gloves in the event they have to deal with individuals who may have the disease, said Officer Joe Silva, a Stockton Police Department spokesman.

“As it relates to responding to public health emergencies, officers are trained in understanding their role in the Incident Command System and working side by side with fire, public health and any other agency to address community safety concerns,“ Silva said.

Risk of contact with a COVID-19 patient in San Joaquin County remains low, said Katherine Shafer, Emergency Medical Services Agency in a statement.

However, because there has been documented community transmission of the new coronavirus in nearby counties and elsewhere in the continental U.S., Shafer has directed all emergency medical personnel to operate under the assumption that any patient with signs and symptoms of a respiratory illness potentially has a COVID-19 infection.

Non-emergency city staff may also see some changes as to what they are able to do, such as eliminating face-to-face training or other non-essential events, said Connie Cochran, city spokeswoman. For example, events like Coffee with a Cop will be canceled.

“We are not going to be doing things that bring people together,” Cochran said, adding that the city’s main concern is the elderly and populations with conditions that make them more susceptible to severe illness from the novel coronavirus. “We are really worried about people who are high-risk,” she said.

The City of Stratford and Perth County (as well as all of its member municipalities) declared a state of emergency on Thursday.

Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson says the move was made to help raise awareness of the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic.

“I did so in an effort to raise awareness with regard to community spread and the dangers it poses,” he said in a video posted to Twitter.

“I also did it to raise awareness about COVID-19 and coronavirus, so that we can all do our part and to make sure that we follow the advice of Dr. Myriam Clausen and the professionals at the Huron-Perth County Health Unit.”

Stratford made the decision at the same time as did its neighbouring municipalities, although St. Mary’s made the move a week earlier.

“The decision to declare an emergency is not taken lightly,” Aitcheson said. “Perth County is being proactive in our fight against COVID-19 to protect the health and safety of individuals and families.”

The joint statement from Perth County, Perth South, Perth East and Perth West noted several reasons why the move was made on Thursday.

It noted that the declaration was made to protect citizens and volunteers, as well as the municipalities rights to any compensation that becomes available.

Stefan Chatwin, city manager in Fairfield, signed the emergency declaration at 2 p.m., the city reports.

The proclamation provides additional legal authorization to take regulatory actions to address the emergency, allows for suspension of formal competitive bidding requirements to purchase necessary supplies and facilitates reimbursement from the state and federal government for costs incurred in addressing the emergency, the city said in a press release.

A special meeting of the City Council has been called Wednesday for the city manager’s actions to be ratified by the council.

Greg Folsom, city manager in Suisun City, also declared a medical emergency Monday in his community.

“I have declared a local state of emergency in order to allow the city to request funding, equipment and supplies from both CalOES and FEMA,” Folsom said in a prepared statement. “Further, the declaration will allow me, as director of Emergency Services, to take extraordinary measures to ensure public safety. As such, until further notice, City Hall and other city facilities will be closed to the public effective Tuesday . . . and residents are encouraged to do any business with the city online or by phone.”

The City Council ratified the emergency declaration Tuesday night.

City Hall will be open for City Council meetings, and city staff will be available to assist with water service, building permits and other services by telephone, email and online at www.suisun.com.

“I know that the measures being put in place by local, state and federal officials to try to slow down the spread of Covid-19 are making life difficult for many people, but I ask that the citizens of Suisun City have patience and cooperate with officials as we all work to try to put our collective health and safety at the forefront of our decision-making,” Mayor Lori Wilson said in the statement. “We will do what we can as a community to weather this season of uncertainty.”

Police and fire services will continue uninterrupted in both cities.

At this time, the County Public Health Department has reported 48 confirmed coronavirus cases in the county.

Yesterday, neighboring city, Santa Clara, also declared a State of Emergency in response to the Coronavirus.

Back on January 31, the United States Department of Public Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar declared a public emergency for the novel coronavirus beginning on January 27, 2020. On March 4, California State Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the State of California due to the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the State. On March 5, Santa Clara County declared an emergency due to the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the County. And then yesterday, March 11, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.

Yesterday, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department said they recommend canceling events of 250 or more.

“We are aware of the recommendations the White House issued today for our county as well as Seattle-King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties in Washington. We are pleased that the White House has adopted many of the recommendations the County Public Health Department previously issued,” said Santa Clara County Health Department in a statement. “However, we recommend that all community residents follow the more stringent guidance issued by the County, including the legal order to cancel all events with 1,000 or more people, and the further recommendation that all large events (including but not limited to all events of 250 or more) be canceled.”

“We continue to work in partnership with public health experts at the CDC, the state of California, and other significantly impacted communities to issue guidance to the public,” the statement continued. “We will continue to make decisions based on the best evidence available, locally relevant data on COVID-19, and the expertise of our public health officials.”",state_of_emergency,153656.0,37.3836,-122.0257

The Yuba County Board of Supervisors and Sutter County Board of Supervisors will consider her recommendation at their respective meetings on Tuesday, March 10, 2020.

Dr. Luu and staff from Yuba and Sutter counties believe this is the right time to make the declaration to ensure an appropriate, timely and organized response in the event COVID-19 cases are identified in the bi-county region. Dr. Luu believes it is simply a matter of time before someone in the region tests positive for the virus, so increasing monitoring and responsive capabilities now will further enable public health teams to prevent as much community transmission as possible.

Staff from both Yuba and Sutter counties have been working closely together to monitor residents who believe they could have COVID-19, communicate plans with area hospitals and health clinics, ensure nurses and first responders have the tools necessary to keep themselves healthy and safe, and communicate important information to the public. A coronavirus preparedness group was established last month, and that group has been in communication with each facet of the community – like schools, hospitals, Beale Air Force Base, and public safety entities – to ensure the area as a whole is equipped with the best knowledge and tools to minimize the impact of COVID-19.

Over the past several weeks of COVID-19 concerns, public health staff from both counties have been operating what is known as a Department Operations Center (DOC) at a low level. The DOC is now elevating to the next level and stepping up efforts to address the health threat. A bi-county Emergency Operations Center based in Yuba County has also opened. This means staff from both counties are working together around the clock to ensure that resources and staffing remain in healthy and reliable supply.

A Bi-County Call Center has been established to respond to inquiries from area residents regarding the COVID-19 threat. The Call Center number is 749-7700, and will be open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The Call Center is intended to field general questions, not provide medical advice. Please call your primary care physician for medical advice.

Yuba and Sutter counties have been planning for this possibility and staff are properly prepared to handle the work to come. Since there are NO confirmed cases in either county, the approach may look different from Sacramento, Placer, and other counties, where community transmission has been confirmed. Nonetheless, increasing the level of public health response is necessary in focusing vital resources on preventing severe illnesses and deaths.

With no confirmed cases at this time, and per California Department of Public Health guidelines, en masse cancellation of schools is not recommended. Schools will continue with measures to prevent spread of COVID-19. The Counties continue to work closely with the Offices of Education in both counties and their respective school districts to plan and prepare our schools for COVID-19 (those CDPH guidelines can be read here).

Dr. Luu continues to recommend hand-washing and practicing good hygiene. Vulnerable populations – the elderly and those with chronic illnesses – are encouraged to stay home as much as possible and avoid large gatherings. Keeping yourself from getting sick in the first place remains key in this effort.

If you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as fever, chills, or cough and have recently traveled to a country with widespread community transmission (Iran, Italy, China, South Korea), or been in close contact with a patient who has had COVID-19, immediately contact your medical provider by phone – do not go into Urgent Care, the Emergency Room or the doctor’s office. Instead, you should call your personal physician, who can assess whether your illness matches those of COVID-19 and if testing should be completed. If testing is indicated, the physician will then contact Dr. Luu, Bi-County Health Officer for consultation.

The proclamation signed Tuesday by City Manager Aaron Adams will enable the city to streamline logistical resources and recovery measures needed to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. It will

be considered for adoption by the Temecula City Council at its next meeting on Tuesday, March 24, city officials said. Temecula City Council meetings are televised on channel 3.

Visit Riverside County Public Health for the latest on confirmed coronavirus cases in the county, as well as the number of fatalities linked to the disease.

Stewart reminded residents and businesses that a countywide order is in place prohibiting social gatherings of 10 or more people. Read the county order here.



""I urge Temecula to unite with patience and perspective that these restrictions are temporary, and are being implemented to ensure the safety and well-being of our families and neighbors while also minimizing the impacts to first responders, hospitals, and medical providers,"" Stewart said.

Under the countywide order, gatherings of less than 10 people must have enough available room to maintain six feet of space between attendees — known as ""social distancing.""

The restrictions are in place in an effort to prevent a COVID-19 spike that would overwhelm local hospitals and health care provides.

A full list of city of Temecula closures is available at www.TemeculaCA.gov/coronavirus.

""The city of Temecula is underway with creative efforts to support the community during this historic and challenging time. For example, we are ensuring that the temporary closure of the Mary Philips Senior Center does not disenfranchise our elderly and vulnerable population from the low-cost lunches they looked forward to each day so the city, in partnership with Office on Aging and the City's meal vendor Sodexo, will be offering a week's worth of meals for curbside pickup each Friday at the Senior Center,"" Stewart said.

The city acknowledged its local economy is not immune from this global health emergency and the difficult impacts businesses, hotels, wineries, restaurants, and their workforce are facing with the current countywide restrictions.

The city's Economic Development Division is refocusing its efforts to seek innovative ways that can support local businesses throughout this pandemic and in collaboration with the Temecula Valley Chamber of Commerce and Visit Temecula Valley, according to city officials.

Stewart advises everyone to follow the directives of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help slow disease spread.

""Wash hands frequently, clean and disinfect surfaces often, sneeze or cough into your elbow or a tissue, and practice social distancing but also find ways to check in on your neighbor, buy takeout

food from restaurants, purchase items from local stores online, and let Temecula be the example of calm and kindness to each other and to our local businesses because we are all in it together, and this too shall pass.""",state_of_emergency,114327.0,33.4928,-117.1315
Torrance,CA,03-13-2020 21:21,https://www.dailybreeze.com/city-of-torrance-declares-state-of-local-emergency-amid-coronavirus-concerns,Torrance declares state of local emergency amid coronavirus concerns,"Torrance has become the latest Southern California community to declare a local state of emergency, postponing all scheduled city events with more than 20 attendees for the next 30 days in an attempt to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Torrance Unified School District also suspended classes on Friday, effective from Monday, March 16, to March 27.

City Manager LeRoy Jackson, acting in his capacity as director of emergency services, declared the local emergency Thursday evening.

“The city recognizes the very real potential for widespread community transmission of COVID-19 occurring among the general public and the need for the city of Torrance to work cooperatively and proactively to slow the spread,” a city statement said.

The City Council will meet Tuesday to address “emergency” items only, which is expected to include the ratification of the state of emergency that could then be extended beyond seven days.

The city has also opened its Emergency Operations Center and established a joint incident communications center staffed by municipal officials and emergency responders, as well as local hospitals.

COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms associated with the respiratory disease, which appear two-to-14 days after exposure, include fever, a cough and shortness of breath. While most people — including healthy young adults — will experience mild symptoms, the disease can be severe and possibly fatal for at-risk groups, such as the elderly and those with other health problems.

Since the fatality rate increases with age, government officials have suggested older people limit their potential exposure and avoid large social gatherings. And state officials have said everyone needs to practice “social distancing” by maintaining a distance of 6 feet from others in public.

That’s behind the Torrance’s effort to “work cooperatively and proactively to slow the spread” of the novel coronavirus and cancel most municipal events, according to the proclamation.

Los Angeles County has also declared a public-health emergency.

Torrance officials warned in the proclamation that if novel coronavirus cases increase rapidly and the worst fears regarding its spread are “fully manifested,” that could have “significant impacts” to city services, personnel and facilities.

Cancellations include the popular farmers market at Wilson Park on Saturday, March 14, according to a list published on CityofTorranceCA.com, which updates the status of scheduled events. That’s a newly established website; the official Torrance website remains inaccessible after hackers launched a cyberattack March 1 that knocked the city’s email and credit card processing system offline. The city is also unable to access and update its own website.

Farmers market manager Joyce Chan spent Friday morning reluctantly spreading word of the closure of Saturday’s market, among the largest in Southern California. Merchants, she noted, were already grappling with increasing costs, such as the new $15 minimum wage.

“It’s really hard to make these calls,” she said. “They more than ever need our market to survive.”

The status of next week’s markets, on Tuesday and the following Saturday, will be discussed after the weekend, Chan said.

Also closed beginning Friday are Torrance’s three senior citizen centers.

Community events affected include Saturday’s annual Now’T But Stout Festival at Yorkshire Square Brewery in Old Torrance, which was rescheduled for May 2, as well as the annual Switzer Center Women of the Year event slated for March 20.",state_of_emergency,146758.0,33.8346,-118.3417
Truckee,CA,,https://www.sierrasun.com/news/health-wellness/town-of-truckee-declares-local-emergency-over-coronavirus/,Town of Truckee declares local emergency over coronavirus,"With more cases of coronavirus reported throughout the state and in Placer County, Truckee has declared a local emergency to prepare the town for possible outbreaks.

“We want to make absolutely clear to council, to the community, to anyone listening, that we don’t feel it is a true emergency,” said Town Manager Jeff Loux. “We don’t want to panic anyone, we don’t want to cause any hysteria. But we believe it is prudent to recognize that this epidemic is real.”

The primary reason for declaring an emergency, Loux said, is that it would give the town access to state and federal emergency funds if necessary. According to town lawyer Andrew Morris, the town would only be eligible for those funds if a state of emergency was declared.

On March 4, Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in California, with Nevada County, Grass Valley and Nevada City declaring local emergencies this week. While Placer County has reported eight cases and one death, there are currently no known cases of coronavirus in Nevada County.

“The stigma of declaring an emergency is where this becomes problematic,” said Truckee Police Chief Rob Leftwich. He compared the declaration to signing a Memorandum of Understanding “to obtain logistical and operational funding from state and federal resources.”

“That’s exactly what we’re doing,” Leftwich said. “Hopefully we won’t need the funding for anything.”

“I think it’s important to be proactive, to get in front of this, to be prepared and have the resources aligned if we need them,” said Truckee council member David Tirman.

Truckee has not been immune to the travel impacts the virus has had.

“While this decision is being considered, Visit Truckee is hearing about group cancellations, event cancellations and cancellations from travellers who do not want to fly,” Colleen Dalton, Visit Truckee’s director of tourism and economic programs, told the council at its Tuesday meeting.

Dalton expressed concern over the impacts the declaration would have on tourism. She said one medium-sized hotel in Truckee is projecting $100,000 in losses this month.

Though the flight market has taken a huge hit, Dalton said they still have a strong drive market, or tourists from the Bay Area and Nevada. Moving forward they’ll be amplifying their “wellness campaign” to attract those who may be feeling anxious about the virus in bigger cities.

Upland’s proclamation empowers City Manager Rosemary Hoerning as the director of emergency services to proclaim the existence or threatened existence of a local emergency should the city become affected by a public health crisis while the Upland City Council is not in session.

The declaration also allows the city to seek future reimbursement from state and federal sources for monies spent responding to COVID-19.

Vacaville,CA,03-18-2020 22:53,https://www.thereporter.com/coronavirus-vacaville-declares-local-emergency,Coronavirus: Vacaville declares local emergency,"The city of Vacaville signed a proclamation of local emergency in the wake of the rapidly evolving challenges presented by the coronavirus late Tuesday afternoon.

The proclamation was signed by City Manager Jeremy Craig and follows similar proclamations made by the state, Solano County and other cities.

“The proclamation empowers the City to take additional legal, operational, and recovery actions that may become necessary to respond (to) the rapidly evolving and changing COVID-19 situation that is affecting communities across the nation,” city officials wrote in a news release.

Fire Chief Kris Concepcion said the city’s department heads recommended Craig declare a local emergency in regards to the constantly changing situation with the coronavirus, particularly in light of guidelines issued by Solano County’s Public Health Department and Gov. Gavin Newsom.

“We are probably gonna incur some additonal costs that we normally wouldn’t have if it weren’t for the issue,” he said. “Potentially, our response, we may have to take different action.”

Concepcion said the proclamation does not have any impacts on residents but mostly is used as a planning tool. The proclamation has enabled the city to partially activate its Emergency Operations Center, a central command and control facility that enables the city to collaborate and communicate across all departments.

“We’ve been monitoring this situation closely, but it gives us a formal way to track our costs or our actions as far as our response as it relates to COVID-19,” he said.

Concepcion said activating the EOC better allows the city to collaborate with local partners such as Solano Public Health as well as other fire and police departments in the county.

The city noted that public counters in Vacaville remain open for the time being but this could change. The city is encouraging customers to do as much business as possible online or over the phone. Links to various online options can be accessed at cityofvacaville.com/covid-19.

Concepcion said the city is closely following guidelines by the county and state. He also advised people to stop the spread of the coronavirus by frequently washing hands, keeping an arm’s length away from others and staying home if possible.

Staff are also developing contingency plans in the event further changes to operations are ordered and are encouraging residents to monitor the city’s website at ci.vacaville.ca.us, its social media pages or Channel 26 for further updates.

“This situation is changing it seems on a minute-by-minute basis,” Concepcion said. “Vacaville residents can rest assured that the city staff is staying on top of the situation, and we will respond appropriately and change those actions if needed.”

VACAVILLE — City Manager Jeremy Craig late Tuesday afternoon signed a proclamation declaring a local emergency exists in Vacaville due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The city joins Solano County and several other cities in making the decision. The council is expected to ratify the proclamation at its meeting Tuesday.

“The proclamation empowers the city to take additional legal, operational and recovery actions that may become necessary to respond to the rapidly evolving and changing Covid-19 situation that is affecting communities across the nation,” a statement released Wednesday by the city said.

The city also has “partially activated” its emergency operations center to enhance the “collaboration and communication across all departments.”

“It will also enable the city to more closely monitor information from the field, allied agencies, partners and other external sources,” the statement said.

While all public counters at the city remain open, staff encourages “customers to do as much business as possible online or by telephone, rather than visiting the public counters.” The city is also developing additional contingency plans to meet future service or operational directives.

Vacaville,CA,03-21-2020 23:30,https://www.thereporter.com/coronavirus-vacaville-city-council-to-vote-on-local-emergency-declaration,Coronavirus: Vacaville City Council to vote on local emergency declaration,"The Vacaville City Council has only one item on its agenda for its regular meeting Tuesday, but it is the topic at the forefront of everybody’s minds.

The council will be voting to ratify the local emergency proclamation that was issued by City Manager Jeremy Craig Tuesday in response to the global coronavirus pandemic that has resulted in more than 200,000 confirmed cases worldwide.

Since it was first identified in Wuhan, China in December, COVID-19 — also known as the novel coronavirus — has spread rapidly, resulting in more than 10,000 cases in the United States alone, including 675 positive cases in California and 16 reported deaths. This has prompted states of emergency to be declared at all levels of government, including from President Donald Trump, Gov. Gavin Newsom and in Solano County, where 13 cases have been reported by the Office of Emergency Services as of Saturday. The first reported case in the country of an individual contracting the virus without having traveled internationally or knowingly come into contact with someone with the virus was in Vacaville.

On Wednesday, the Solano County Public Health Department issued a shelter-at-home order, which was followed by Newsom declaring it at a much higher level Thursday.

Per state law as well as the Vacaville Municipal Code, a local emergency proclamation must be ratified by the council to remain in effect, Craig wrote in a staff report. Once it is ratified, the council must review the need to continue the emergency proclamation at least every 60 days until it is terminated by the council.

Acting as the director of emergency services, Craig has also directed that City Hall be closed to the public — except by appointment — through April 7 unless extended further. Craig also recommends that staff telecommute to the fullest extent possible and those who do come to work at a city department stay at least six feet apart from one another unless it is impossible. Craig also suggests that staff be reassigned as necessary to ensure the government continues essential operations while the emergency is in place.

“As one of many consequences of the recent County shelter at home order, the State stay home order, and the related efforts for certain employees to shelter at home, for employees to telecommute and for staff to be re-assigned to support continuing government operations, the City will be unable to promptly respond to requests for public records or meet other deadlines, including those under the Permit Streamlining Act and Federal regulations related to processing ‘shot clocks’ for telecommunications facilities and small wireless facilities,” Craig wrote. “Therefore the City seeks relief from these timelines by adding a further directive to the actions already taken by the Director.”

Staff recommends the council adopt the resolution ratifying the local emergency proclamation.

The council will meet at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Council Chamber at City Hall, 650 Merchant St. While the public is not discouraged from attending the meeting, seating will be limited and those who do attend are advised to keep at least 6 feet away from others.

Residents are encouraged to watch a live stream of the meeting on Channel 26, online at ci.vacaville.ca.us/city-government/agendas-and-minutes or on the city’s YouTube page at Youtube.com/user/CityofVacaville.

Councilors will meet during an emergency meeting set for 6 p.m., Monday, inside the Vallejo City Hall Council Chambers, 555 Santa Clara. St.

“The emergency proclamation is needed to allow the city to access funding, equipment and supplies from (California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services) CalOES and (Federal Emergency Management Agency) FEMA to assist the city in the battle against the coronavirus,” a staff report to the council states.

City Manager Greg Nyhoff serves as Vallejo’s director of emergency services.

“Such powers will allow the city to continue providing vital services during the duration of the emergency and to limit the impact of the coronavirus on the community and on the city’s employees who are on the front lines of combating the coronovirus and serving the public need,” staff added in the same report to the council.

Victor,CA,03-18-2020 04:49,https://www.vvng.com/city-of-victorville-declares-local-emergency-amid-coronavirus-concerns/,City of Victorville Declares Local Emergency Amid Coronavirus Concerns,"VICTORVILLE, Calif. – Today, the City of Victorville announced that it has declared a local emergency as a proactive measure to help ensure the City has financial resources and legal authority to institute protective measures aimed at reducing the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19).

“At this time, there are no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the High Desert; but this is a rapidly-evolving situation,” said Victorville Mayor, Gloria Garcia. “Declaring a local emergency now will enable us to take bold steps to help protect our community with necessary human and financial resources.”

Declaration of a local emergency in accordance with its municipal code, enables the City to seek reimbursement for its expenses associated with COVID-19 from federal and state entities.

Garcia says concern for the City’s homeless population factored heavily in the City’s decision. Victorville has the second-highest homeless population in the County of San Bernardino according to recent Point in Time Counts. According to the Center for Disease and Control, unsheltered individuals are at greater risk of exposure due to inadequate sanitation and the lack of good hygiene, which are essential to reducing the spread of COVID-19.

“We want to afford our homeless population the resources needed to practice the public health hygiene and social distancing recommended by the Center for Disease Control,” according to Garcia. “In order to protect this vulnerable population and reduce potential spread of the virus in our community, we will need to expend City resources to increase sanitation and hygiene.”

In accordance with CDC guidelines, the City is in the process of securing portable restrooms, trash dumpsters, and hand washing stations to be located in locations most frequented by the City’s homeless population.

City officials are also working with local shelters and homeless service agencies to institute added precautions. Currently, the three local homeless shelters have stopped taking new occupants until effective screening can be implemented to protect occupants and staff. City staff is procuring medical instruments for these shelters to check temperatures during the intake process in accordance with CDC guidelines. Additional guidelines being implemented are three-foot distance between bunks in sleeping quarters; and the City is in active discussions with the operator of the local warming shelter to allow for 24-hour service to further aid this vulnerable population, which has a propensity for underlying ailments and compromised immune systems.

The City’s emergency declaration closely follows emergency declarations at the state, county and federal level. Also today, the Acting Health Officer for the County of San Bernardino announced the County’s third confirmed case of COVID-19 and ordered the cancellation of gatherings of any size within San Bernardino County along with the closure of all movie theatres gyms, health clubs, bars, adult entertainment establishments, and other businesses that serve alcohol but do not serve food.

“For the protection of our community and to help reduce spread of COVID-19, I urge our local businesses and residents to follow the latest directives from the San Bernardino County Public Health Department,” said Garcia. “These are unprecedented times, and all of us must do our part to practice public health hygiene and social distancing. Together, we will remain a strong Victorville.”

March 15, the City of Victorville announced that it would be closing City facilities to public access as well as its events, activities and classes as a precautionary measure effective March 16 through March 30. City employees continue to work and carryout essential City functions such as public safety, water and sewer, customer service and more. Phone and online customer service options are available. Information about these remote customer service options, a full listing of City facilities and programs affected by the closing, and helpful resources are available on the City’s website at VictorvilleCA.gov/coronavirus.

The City of Victorville is closely monitoring the coronavirus situation; and City leaders are communicating with federal, state, and county public health agencies. Garcia assures that the City “stands ready” to take additional necessary precautions for the community.

Because this is a rapidly evolving situation, City officials recommend community members follow guidance offered by public health agencies such as the San Bernardino County Public Health Department, California Department of Public Health, and the Center for Disease Control.

Tulare County and Visalia both declared states of emergency late last week in response to the COVID-19 virus. Fresno County and Fresno also declared a state of emergency this week.

Last night, Visalia council members ratified the city's local emergency proclamation.

""This is done mostly to take advantage of available resources, to be able to access funding, reimbursement, etc.,"" City Manager Randy Groom said.

Groom declared the local emergency Saturday in his role as director of emergency services, giving city council seven days to ratify the decision and triggering the opening of a city emergency operations center.

The Tulare County Board of Supervisors ratified two county declarations at Tuesday's board meeting, one of a local emergency and one of a local health emergency, both declared on March 11.

“We declared a local emergency to get local funding if we needed additional staffing or reimbursements for testing supplies,” Tulare County Supervisor Amy Shuklian said.

On March 4, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency in response to COVID-19. Tulare County joins at least 24 other counties in California in proclaiming a local emergency because of the virus. Fresno County supervisors also declared a local emergency Tuesday.

Tulare

Tulare City Council will also discuss COVID-19 and its local impacts at Tuesday's council meeting. Tulare has not yet declared a state of emergency. Mayor Jose Sigala told the Advance-Register he plans to request a special meeting to do so.

“We can’t wait until April 7 to have another city meeting,” he said. “This is a big issue for our city. It’s happening and we want to do everything we can to protect our employees and the public.”

The public is invited to attend Tuesday night's 7 p.m. meeting in person, but staff will have social distancing precautions in place. After city staff presents an update, council members are expected to give staff direction.

""We are all hands on deck,"" Sigala said.

Groom said that while Newsom has established recommendations to close bars, taprooms and other establishments, Visalia and its police do not have the authority to enforce those recommendations as law.

""The Council has not taken any actions to close any particular kinds of business,"" he said. ""The Chief of Police (Jason Salazar) has clarified that his department cannot enforce a recommendation or guideline.""

Public access to council meetings and video conferencing is being taken a step further with council’s recent motion to purchase quality dedicated equipment.

In order to comply with the Province’s new safety measures, avoiding public gatherings and distancing, the meeting is available on the municipality’s You Tube channel.

Reeve Clayton Canart said it was important for the RM to improve video conferencing for people “so they don’t have to travel or us to them.” After a staff presentation on quotes and options, he said, 3C Tech probably fits what I was hoping we would get to.” The question arose about when the Virden tech company could supply the hardware.

CAO Garth Mitchell said, “That type of material is flying off the shelf right now.”

Councillor Barb Stambuski urged council to make a decision at that meeting. “I think we should make the motion and get it going.” A motion was passed to purchase the necessary equipment from 3C Tech.

In unfinished business, zoning bylaws have been put on hold until such time as council decides how to hold public hearings.

Wallace-Woodworth will supply water to a farm that is right across from the municipal boundary Road 72. This is a single farm hook-up.

Road bans come into effect on Friday, March 27, at 6:00 a.m.

In order for heavy vehicles to use a road during the ban, there’s one-time permit available for commercial operators that are examined on merit with each request. The RM is working out the means of online payment for this, including the use of credit cards. Contact the office for more details.

Wallace-Woodworth plans to be members of two conservation districts - newly minted watershed-based Souris River Watershed District and Assiniboine West Watershed District and council passed first reading.

A group of municipalities are served by Highway 83. They are getting organized to act as a lobby group. Council passed a motion to attend (by remote access yet to be confirmed) an upcoming meeting to be held in Pipestone.

Council considered a report on FCM Climate Adaptation. It’s a plan around water management on the Scallion, Bosshill and Gopher creeks in an attempt to find a way to minimize flooding and infrastructure damage. Undertaken by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, it has been an ongoing topic.

Reeve Clayton Canart re-stated other councillors’ remarks saying, “I don’t see us even remotely getting involved with something with that kind of numbers (cost),” adding that the conservation district can undertake some flood mitigation “for a reasonable amount.”

During committee reports, Councillor Mark Humphries brought forth a concern for businesses in Elkhorn and Kenton, with the coronavirus pandemic and isolation measures. “There’s at least four small businesses that are extremely worried. And [some] in Kenton too.”

Updated at 8:45 p.m. ET

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 11 people, after officials reported fatalities in California and Washington state on Wednesday. The most recent death is connected to a cruise ship that traveled from the U.S. to Mexico.

Officials in Placer County, Calif., announced that an elderly resident has become the first person to die from the illness in California. The patient, who was not identified, had underlying health conditions, according to the county.

The patient tested positive for the coronavirus illness on Tuesday and ""was likely exposed during international travel from Feb. 11-21 on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico,"" according to a statement published on Placer County's website.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

Roughly a week passed from the end of the cruise to when the patient was hospitalized, officials say. An ambulance took the patient to a hospital on Feb. 27; in the interval, the person had ""minimal community exposure,"" the county says. The patient had been in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville.

Gov. Gavin Newsom extended his condolences to the patient's loved ones and said the state is working with federal agencies to trace people who might have had contact with the patient. Later Wednesday, Newsom declared a state of emergency over coronavirus in California, which has more than 50 confirmed cases, according to health officials.

Placer County spans a wide area, from the outskirts of Sacramento to Lake Tahoe.

Among California's cases are 24 people who arrived in the U.S. on repatriation flights from outbreak locations in Asia.

The other cases include seven people who were infected via person-to-person exposure and 12 travel-related cases.

""Approximately 515 persons have been tested to date,"" the California Department of Public Health says.

To prevent the virus from spreading, health experts recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer. Face masks should be worn only by people who are either sick or are caring for someone who is, according to the World Health Organization.

Washington state

Washington state raised its own death toll from COVID-19 to 10 people earlier Wednesday. The state now has 39 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease, with 31 of them in Seattle and King County. The other eight cases are in neighboring Snohomish County.

Many of the cases are linked to Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., the long-term care facility northeast of Seattle that is at the center of the outbreak in King County.

On Wednesday afternoon, officials in Seattle and King County issued recommendations for vulnerable residents to try to contain the spread of coronavirus in the area.

""People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others,"" they said in a statement.

That group includes people 60 and older; people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; those with weakened immune systems; and people who are pregnant.

In addition, officials said companies should take steps to allow employees to work from home, if possible, and recommended that people avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities and nursing homes.

More than 230 people in Washington state are under supervision out of concern that they may have been exposed to the pathogen, the Washington Department of Health says.

Los Angeles declares emergency

Hours before Gov. Newsom declared an emergency for the entire state, the city of Los Angeles declared a health emergency over the coronavirus, citing the need to address the possibility of community transmission of the disease that has caused more than 3,200 deaths globally.

The move comes after Los Angeles County confirmed six new cases of the coronavirus and seven overall, according to Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.

""I have signed a declaration of local emergency for the City of Los Angeles,"" Mayor Eric Garcetti announced via Facebook. ""While there are only a few known active COVID-19 cases in the region, the declaration helps us access state and federal funding to strengthen and support our efforts to prepare our region and keep our communities safe.""

Los Angeles County mirrored the city's move, in a step that the chair of the county's board of supervisors, Kathryn Barger, said was a planned reaction to the virus.

""This is not a response rooted in panic,"" Barger said, adding that the emergency declaration would help agencies coordinate their response and contain the virus in a county where more than 10 million people live.

One person has been hospitalized while five others are being monitored at home, Ferrer said. The county's first patient, a Chinese national who was diagnosed in January, has recovered from the virus, she said.

""Three of the new cases were travelers who were traveling together in northern Italy,"" Ferrer said at a news conference. Two others are relatives of a person who was infected with the coronavirus outside of the county, she said. The sixth case is a person who works in a field that exposes them to international travelers, Ferrer added.

Later Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that a worker at the city's international airport who screened incoming flights from China and nearby countries had tested positive for the virus.

Cases rise in U.S.

There are at least 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19 that originated in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier Wednesday. That number doesn't include the 49 Americans diagnosed with COVID-19 who have been repatriated from outbreaks in Wuhan, China, and aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

At least 13 states have reported coronavirus cases since late January.

While international travel has been linked to 24 of the U.S. cases, the cause of transmission is still under investigation in 40 cases. Person-to-person spread in the U.S. has caused infection in 16 cases, according to the CDC .

The CDC data reflects numbers that were reported by 4 p.m. ET the previous day — meaning the actual number of cases in the U.S. might be higher than the most recent posting by the agency.

""States are now testing and publicly reporting their cases,"" the CDC says. ""In the event of a discrepancy, state case counts are the most up to date.""

In addition to California and Washington, other states reporting coronavirus cases include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin.

Although Texas previously had cases from people returning from China or who had been aboard the Diamond Princess, officials on Wednesday reported a newly detected infection in a person who had recently traveled aboard.

""Having a COVID-19 case in Texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn't change the fact that the immediate risk to most Texans is low,"" said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. ""This travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting limit the spread of COVID-19 and all respiratory illnesses.""",state_of_emergency,78.0,39.3591,-120.7906
Waterloo,CA,,https://globalnews.ca/news/6729364/coronavirus-waterloo-region-state-of-emergency/,"Coronavirus: Waterloo Region, municipalities declare state of emergency","The Region of Waterloo and its seven municipalities have each declared a state of emergency in response to the growing novel coronavirus pandemic.

Mayors for area cities (Kitchener, Cambridge and Waterloo) and townships (North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot and Woolwich) joined Regional Chair Karen Redman in signing declarations on Wednesday morning.

In a release, the region and municipalities say this will allow Redman and the mayors “to take actions or make orders to protect the inhabitants of the municipality and increases the ability of municipalities to share resources, personnel and equipment to respond and support the broader public sector and key services.”

Redman says the states of emergency will remain in place until they are lifted by the heads of government.

“This stays in place until I as chair, revoke it for the region and it would be the same for the individual municipalities as well,” Redman said.

She said that move is quite open-ended in terms of the powers it grants to local leaders.

As an example, Redman said, “quite literally, we could enlist bylaw officers to go around and make sure that people are adhering to staying in their homes and practising physical distancing.

“People who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, are indeed self-isolating.”

The regional chair explained that the order states ”such actions or orders that he or she considers necessary that are not contrary to the law and implement a regional emergency response plan.”

She says that part of the reason the community leaders chose to declare a state of emergency on Wednesday was in an attempt to make some people aware of how serious the pandemic is.

“I would tell you that part of this is getting the community’s attention so that everybody is taking the lead of public health and Dr. Wang in following her directions,” Redman explained.

She said they are also trying to make travellers returning to Canada aware of how important it is to self-isolate.

“Quite honestly, this is quite a pivotal period of time in the next couple of weeks,” she said. “If we’re able to practice the directives, the social isolation and physical distancing, we can help flatten the curve at this is a crucial time when that behaviour will make an absolute difference over the long run.”

Kitchener Mayor Berry Vrbanovic said there were other practical reasons to invoke the states of emergency.

“While the province has made it absolutely clear that any decisions they’re making right now, they will include the funding for municipalities without having to declare an emergency in the event that that changes either with the province or the federal government,” he said. “This starts a clock ticking where we can also start looking at what some of those expenses are going to be that might potentially be eligible in the future for more funding.”

Vrbanovic also said the move will allow more support for volunteers when they are called upon.

“As we move forward in the coming weeks, it’s going to become increasingly likely we’re going to need to be turning to more community volunteers,” the Kitchener mayor said. “It will do things like giving them WSIB coverage.”

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

Watsonville,CA,03-13-2020 12:39,https://patch.com/california/watsonville/coronavirus-local-health-emergency-declared-watsonville,Coronavirus: Local Health Emergency Declared In Watsonville,"WATSONVILLE, CA — The City of Watsonville declared a Local Health Emergency over the new coronavirus as a preventative measure and to help slow the potential spread of the virus.

""We don't want anyone to panic, but it's important that you be prepared to take preventative measures and the City of Watsonville is doing the same,"" said City Manager Matt Huffaker Thursday in a video.

The city also announced that city programs, events and facility rentals would be canceled through April 6 as a precautionary measure, including the farmers market, Earth Day, census events and more. The Youth Center, community centers, Police Activities League, Science Workshop, Senior Center and Nature Center will be closed.

The Main and Freedom libraries remain open, though programming has been cancelled.

The city called upon partners and community organizations to cancel events.

The California Department of Public Health issued an advisory Wednesday, calling for the cancelation of events of 250 attendees or more. Organizers of smaller events should ensure participants are six feet away from each other.

Utility late bill and shutoff notices will be waived until further notice, but customers are encouraged to pay their bills online or by calling 831-768-3455.

Thursday night Santa Cruz County announced a total of seven coronavirus cases were confirmed in the community.

Last week county health officials issued a Local Health Emergency for the new coronavirus due to concerns about its spread in neighboring counties and a need to prepare for a potential outbreak.

Anyone with concerns about their health should contact their doctor or call 211 to find a local clinic. The county encourages the public to visit santacruzhealth.org/coronavirus for local updates and links to important CDC updates.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency Wednesday to provide additional resources, prevent price gouging and help the state better prepare for the virus's spread.

The emergency declaration followed the first known coronavirus-related death in California — an elderly Placer County resident who was exposed to the virus on a Grand Princess cruise Feb. 11-21 from San Francisco to Mexico and back.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that include the common cold as well as much more serious diseases. The strain that emerged in China in late 2019, now called COVID-19, is related to others that have caused serious outbreaks in recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on Jan. 21. The disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.

According to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.

To avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Watsonville,CA,03-24-2020 11:17,https://patch.com/california/watsonville/coronavirus-watsonville-halts-evictions,Watsonville Halts Evictions Amid Coronavirus State Of Emergency,"WATSONVILLE, CA — The Watsonville City Council approved Monday a temporary halt on residential and commercial evictions during the state of emergency, which was enacted due to concerns about the new coronavirus. Renters, who comprise six in 10 Watsonville households, will still be responsible for paying landlords back rent when the moratorium is called off, said City Manager Matt Huffaker.

People have lost work and parents must care for children since schools have closed in an effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, according to a city staff report on the ordinance.



""The ordinance is aimed at protecting tenants who are at risk of eviction due to financial hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Huffaker said, ""in an effort to keep people housed and protect the health and wellbeing of the community.""

Renters must still pay their utilities. The city previous waived late fees and froze utility shutoffs amid the local emergency declared in the City of Watsonville March 12.

Emergencies due to coronavirus have also been declared at the state level and county level on March 4.

The city said it will release an FAQ sheet soon with information about the ordinance.

According to Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency, the patient is an older female with underlying health conditions who acquired the disease through community transmission. Officials say she is currently hospitalized but her condition is improving.

The county is also issuing a local health emergency and local emergency to gain access to state or federal funding.

“Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world, I am not surprised that the virus is in our county,” Yolo County Public Health Officer Dr. Ron Chapman wrote in a statement. “Unfortunately, there is a lot of misinformation driving fear in our communities. We will continue to provide COVID-19 education, support, and advice to the community while using appropriate measures to protect the public’s health.”

The call comes in the same week California announced its first death from COVID-19, a Placer County resident. Earlier this week, nearby Sacramento and Placer counties declared local health emergencies, in addition to Gov. Gavin Newsom declaring a state emergency.

A student at UC Davis in Yolo County was tested for the disease last month and their two roommates were isolated. The student's test came back negative. The person with the first case of COVID-19 attributed to community transmission is being treated at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.",state_of_emergency,402.0,38.7405,-121.8093
Yolo,CA,03-08-2020 11:54,https://www.dailydemocrat.com/yolo-supervisors-to-declare-emergency-over-coronavirus,Yolo supervisors to declare emergency over coronavirus,"Yolo County’s Board of Supervisors will likely approve an emergency declaration following the discovery this past week of a woman suffering from the coronavirus.

Supervisors were scheduled to be updated on the coronavirus when they meet Tuesday. However, the board changed its agenda to include the emergency action after Friday’s announcement by health officials.

The person infected with COVID-19 is an “older female with underlying health conditions,” according to county Public Information Officer Jenny Tan on Friday. “She is currently hospitalized and is improving. From initial interviews, she acquired the disease through community transmission.”

Yolo County Public Health Officer Ron Chapman spoke during an afternoon press conference in Woodland, emphasizing that due to privacy concerns information about the individual’s city of residence, her age or the hospital where she is being treated would not be revealed.

Although this is the first confirmed case, Yolo County has tested at least 10 other people for the virus, Chapman said. Their tests came back negative and there are four other cases pending results.

Those who came into close contact with the patient who tested positive are under a 14-day quarantine. If any of these people reveal symptoms consistent with coronavirus, the county will test them as well.

A similar quarantine took place in Yolo County for a group of three UC Davis students last week. One of the students was tested for COVID-19 by the CDC while the other two were observed for symptoms. The test showed a negative result and all students were released from isolation.

The action by supervisors will include issuing two proclamations: A local health emergency and a local emergency, according to Tan.

“The local health emergency proclamation may open additional resources while the local emergency proclamation may open funding, both will provide tools for the county to effectively manage the situation,” she stated.

Other counties that have declared local emergencies for coronavirus include Sacramento, Placer, Solano, Sonoma, Alameda and Los Angeles.

Under state law, the county board is required to ratify the proclamation and declaration with seven days of execution by appropriate county officials.

According to the action proposed, the board must regularly revisit the circumstances surrounding the local emergency and reaffirm that the emergency continues to exist.

Chapman emphasized that coronavirus symptoms are similar to a cold or flu and urged people who start to display such symptoms to stay home.",state_of_emergency,402.0,38.7405,-121.8093
Yolo,CA,03-10-2020 01:00,https://www.dailydemocrat.com/yolo-county-declares-local-emergency-over-coronavirus,Yolo County declares local emergency over coronavirus,"With Yolo County’s first confirmed case of COVID-19 announced late last week, the Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution ratifying a proclamation of local emergency on Monday morning.

Along with an update on the virus scheduled to be presented to the board at its Tuesday meeting, the agenda item was pulled for discussion a day early.

Addressing the board on Monday, Public Health Officer Ron Chapman compared the current version of the zoonotic disease (transmitted between animals and humans) to previous coronaviruses like MERS and SARS.

“We don’t know a whole lot about this new coronavirus in terms of how infectious it is,” Chapman stated. “They’re estimating that it is slightly more infectious than the flu. We don’t know enough yet about the fatality rate but the preliminary data does show it is much lower than SARS (9-to-10% from 2002 to 2003) and MERS (34% from 2012 to present) and maybe ultimately will be about the same as what we see with the flu.

“This flu season, as a side note, has been particularly bad,” Chapman continued. “In the United States, we’ve already seen 15,000 people die from the flu. We’ve actually had three people die in Yolo County from the flu.”

Worldwide, there are over 110,000 cases of COVID-19 with more than 3,000 deaths reported.

If exposed, it can take up to 14 days for an individual to show symptoms including having a cough, runny nose, shortness of breath and/or a fever. Chapman reiterated that 80% of cases are mild and the best course of action is talking to a doctor and staying home.

“I know a lot of folks with mild illness are going to be interested and wanting to get tested but there’s no vaccine or treatment for this,” Chapman said.

People age 65 and older are the most affected by COVID-19 as are those with underlying chronic health conditions. Yolo County’s single case involves an elderly woman with underlying health conditions.

“Children seem to be greatly spared according to data from China, Italy and South Korea and other countries,” Chapman said.

Test kits are being distributed to public health labs in each state as of a few days ago, he clarified. Though they are becoming more readily available, he said they should be saved for hospitalized patients, the elderly and people with chronic or underlying conditions and healthcare workers who may have been exposed.

Flu season is known to end in April, but there is no telling when the spread of COVID-19 will slow down or cease. There is a vaccination in development but it will likely not be ready for up to a year.

“There are a lot of those unknowns that create fear,” Chapman said. “Up until the last week or two the number of cases in the United States hovered around 15. It’s now over 500. They’re looking at doubling the rate every two days from hereon … Where the peak is, nobody knows, but people will be keeping a very, very close eye on the data.”

In the meantime, personal prevention is key. Chapman offered tips like staying home if sick, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds often, covering coughs, not touching your face, not smoking or vaping any products and getting the flu vaccination. Masks are not effective for the general public, he asserted.

He also suggests social distancing tactics like avoiding public events and large crowds.

“The more social distancing and the sooner it happens the fewer cases and deaths we’ll see … the more of those nonessential gatherings we can cancel and postpone at this point through the end of March the better. We will reevaluate after that.”

As Chapman was talking with the board, answering questions about student safety and precautions related to protecting those in elder care facilities, Director of Yolo County Emergency Services Dana Carey had staff calling faith and community-based organizations, childcare facilities, schools and more locations to discuss best practice guidelines that will likely be released in the next 24 hours.

Other measures now in place at the Yountville home include postponing all group activities and trips, as well as staggered mealtimes and social distancing at the dining hall, according to Sin.

The Boulder County Public Health order, issued in coordination with Jefferson County Public Health and the Tri-County Health Department, had been announced Wednesday morning, and took effect at 8 a.m. today. It was to have been in effect until 11:59 p.m. April 17.

However, Polis handed down his own statewide order later Wednesday, which became effective at 6 a.m. today, to expire April 11.

“After much discussion and consideration, our three local health departments have decided to rescind the local level Orders and formally adopt the state’s Order. We believe this action will ensure Stay-At-Home requirements are consistent across the state, and hence will make it easier for our residents to follow,” said a statement issued today by Boulder County Public Health.

“We applaud Gov. Polis for taking this critical step to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our state and ultimately, save lives.”

Boulder County rescinded its order as the number of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 reached 71 as or 4 p.m., up from 69 in the morning, and the county recorded its first death associated with the coronavirus, that of a Lafayette resident in their 60s.

A release from Boulder County Public Health said the patient had underlying medical issues that were exacerbated by contracting COVID-19.

“Our hearts go out to this family,” Boulder County Public Health Director Jeff Zayach said in a statement. “My hope is that we all view this heartbreaking news as a solemn warning about the importance of heeding the Stay-at-Home Order and social distancing requirements in order to prevent more tragedies like this.”

Of those 71, five individuals are hospitalized, seven are under investigation, 26 residents are isolating at home and 28 residents have recovered.

But Boulder County’s official numbers very likely do not fully reflect the actual number of people in the county who have the virus because there are numerous people who have the virus whose test results are not yet known or have not yet been tested because they don’t currently meet the criteria for testing.

Those testing positive for the disease range in age from the teens to the 80s, and the average age is 46 years, according to the release.

Statewide there were 26 confirmed COVID-19 deaths as of 4 p.m. Thursday, with more than 1,400 positive cases.

Also, Thursday, Chana Goussetis, a spokesperson for Boulder County Public Health said the department is abandoning its practice of giving more than one update per day on statistics pertaining to the spread of COVID-19.

Goussetis said that is being done to bring the county’s practice into line with CDPHE, which has been releasing its updated numbers at about 4 p.m. each day.

Goussetis also said it is believed that testing for COVID-19 should be expanding locally in coming days, but that “Locally, we haven’t been given any additional access to testing, so far.”

Currently, she said, the recommended protocol from her department is “If people are feeling ill with flu- like symptoms, we recommend they isolate.

“If they are needing medical help, then they should call their health care provider. They will do an assessment and decide whether they should be tested for COVID-19. And then, the health care provider refers them to where they can get tested.”

COVID-19 testing can be accomplished in Boulder County, she added, “but it is very limited because of the limit on supplies right now.”

Some county residents on Thursday expressed confusion as to whether simply going for a walk, a hike or a ride is still permitted. A “frequently asked questions” feature on Polis’s website stated people are permitted “to engage in outdoor activity, such as, walking, hiking, nordic skiing, snowshoeing, biking or running.

“For purposes of outdoor activity, State parks will remain open to the public to engage in walking, hiking, biking, running, and similar outdoor activities but all playgrounds, picnic areas, other similar areas conducive to public gathering, and attended areas shall be closed.”

It also states people must “take extreme steps to avoid contact with anybody outside their household and minimize contact in public places that could be contaminated with the COVID-19 virus.”

“If people are out and about, it is ideal if they stay close to their neighborhood, and they are not doing it with people they don’t spend time with everyday, anyway,” Goussetis said. “It’s important to know that we don’t want to see huge groups of people at trailheads anymore.”

On a related note, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, to comply with Polis’s order and to comply with directives from CDHE and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, today closed all playgrounds, campgrounds, camping and camping facilities, including yurts and cabins, at state wildlife areas effective immediately, until further notice.

CPW planned to notify all campers currently at state sites to vacate immediately, and would be contacting reservation holders to provide a process for refunds to those affected campers.

Non-campground outdoor areas of parks — including trails, boat ramps, marinas and shorelines were to remain open, although CPW managers may close some of those areas that do not provide for social distancing.

Similarly, the U.S. Forest Service announced today that the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland would immediately begin the orderly closure of certain developed recreation sites and campgrounds, to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Closures will be in place through April 30, at which point they will be reevaluated.

Taylor Sienkiewicz / tsienkiewicz@summitdaily.com

FRISCO — In response to the rising cases of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, in Colorado, Silverthorne Town Council unanimously passed two resolutions Wednesday that would allow budget flexibility in case of an emergency as well as electronic participation in town meetings, if the need arises.

Town attorney Karl Hanlon explained during the council work session that putting both of these resolutions in place would give council flexibility in the event of an emergency, such as a local outbreak of the coronavirus.

Hanlon stressed the importance of the resolution allowing for electronic meetings. If there is an order from the governor that says no gathering in public places for the next 24 hours, for example, council could be in violation of the open meetings act if there was not a mechanism in place for council to meet remotely, he said.

The resolution acknowledges potential problems with video conferencing council meetings — including issues with presentations, the inability for council to read nonverbal language and general inefficiencies — and says the policy can be used only if Town Council adopts a resolution declaring a local disaster emergency or the town manager declares such an emergency.

The second resolution allows the town manager to use up to $100,000 of town funding in response to an emergency. The resolution details that if the governor declares a statewide emergency related to the coronavirus and the town needs to expend resources not previously budgeted, the town or the town manager would be authorized to use town funds for the interest of public health and safety for the town, the state and the county.

Breckenridge Town Council discussed similar actions Tuesday regarding remote video conferencing. Town Manager Rick Holman said this would be brought back to council at the next work session March 24. On Thursday, the Town Council called a special meeting to discuss COVID-19 as it pertains to events and determined it would be in the town’s best interest to limit gatherings that occur on town property — or are run by the town — to 50 people, and to recommend that town businesses follow suit.

Town attorney Tim Berry presented an emergency ordinance at the special meeting that gives Holman broad powers to do what he thinks is necessary to address public health concerns, including the authority to close any town-owned facility and to use town funds as necessary.

During the Monday meeting, Commissioner Doug Weisenauer explained that all elected officials would have to issue a declaration for their respective departments.

Leuthold led much of the discussion as the county leaders weighed options for issues raised by closing the courthouse, which county employees would be considered essential and required to work Monday through Thursdays and how they'd be compensated for time off.

Ultimately, each elected official will decide what happens in his or her department.

""We're all going to have to make some sacrifices; it can't be perfect,"" Sean Leuthold said. He suggested that department heads continue to come into the office on Fridays, saying that was what he intends to do.

For days when the courthouse is open, the possibility of rotating employees — having them work on alternate days — was discussed as an option for ensuring employees are treated fairly.

The consensus of the meeting was that county employees who are told not to report to work will be paid.

""The overriding public policy is as follows: Have less people here, but don't punish them economically,"" said Judge Shane Leuthold of Crawford County Municipal Court.

""This is an extraordinary situation, right?"" Sean Leuthold said. ""We're not going to be able to make sure every little tiny thing is going to be fair and equitable for every single person. There may be some employee who somehow doesn't get exactly what another employee gets. ... If we're going to try to craft a policy that does that, we're not going to get it done.""

Kate Siefert, commissioner of Crawford County Public Health, said the plan being discussed would meet the guidelines set forth by the Ohio Department of Health.

""There's not one-fits-all for any of this,"" she said. ""We are going to have factories that have to stay open and cannot meet social distancing. That's reality.""

In those cases, things such as hand-washing, the use of hand sanitizer and other measures become more important, she said. ""People that have to work just have to be more conscientious about it,"" she said.

She also urged county leaders to plan for essential employees to be absent at some point.

""If there is only one person that knows how to do your HVAC, you need to cross-train,"" she urged.

Health officer: 'This disease is going to get worse before it gets better.'

(Update: More from commissioners' meeting, county health director)

BEND, Ore. (KTVZ) -- Deschutes County commissioners officially declared a state of emergency in the county at a special meeting Friday to discuss various aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Commissioners said the emergency declaration is for 60 days, in an effort to provide emergency funds and policies that can better guide the public.

They said they want to make clear that this action is not at adding to any sense of panic, but will open the doors for more funds and support to get ahead of the virus, which has one presumptive case in the county at present.

Dr. George Conway, the county's health services director, recommended the declaration due to the need for supplies and in anticipation of more cases. He said the second, CDC confirmation for the county COVID-19 case should come back within a week and it will no longer be ""presumptive.""

Conway also said the county is monitoring others now, but they are not ""cases,"" only ""persons under monitoring"" due to possible high-risk contact. He said they're not believed to have the virus.

The doctor said there's still no evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted in the air, only by droplets from cougs or sneezes, or someone who touches one on a surface.

""Any time there is a defnable pattern that could help the public, we will share that information,"" Conway told commissioners.

He said an infectious disease nurse has been working with seniors' long-term care facilities in the county since January, putting plans in place and doing proactive training to keep them safe.

Conway said that if the U.S. fails at taking these proactive measures, it will lead to much larger economic catastrophes. Everything people can do to delay the spread also reduces the chances of overwhelming the available resources.

But he also said: ""The disease is going to get worse before it gets better.""

Here's their news release:

Deschutes County Commissioners issue emergency declaration

The Deschutes County Commissioners have issued an emergency declaration in response to COVID-19. The County joins two other Oregon counties that have issued similar declarations.

The emergency declaration authorizes the county to implement emergency actions, access more resources and take appropriate steps to recover some of the costs associated with the County’s response to the disease.

“This emergency declaration will help us to best serve our residents,” said Deschutes County Commission Chair Patti Adair. “We want to be as prepared as possible to help keep our community safe.”

The declaration of emergency comes two days after the Oregon Health Authority announced the first presumptive positive case in a Deschutes County resident.

The Commissioners met Friday to discuss ongoing and emerging COVID-19 related impacts.

During the meeting, Deschutes County Sheriff's Office Emergency Manager Sgt. Nathan Garibay, Health Services Director Dr. George Conway and County legal counsel advised the commissioners that the emergency declaration will help county staff quickly respond and utilize all available resources to best protect the health of our community.

Local public health officials continue to urge residents to wash hands frequently, cover coughs or sneezes and stay home if you show signs of flu or a bad cold, including fever and cough.

DECLARING A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE CITY OF BEND AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Bend City Manager Eric King has declared a local state of emergency as a result of the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has been confirmed in Deschutes County. Governor Kate Brown has declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Oregon.

The Bend City Council is scheduled to vote to ratify the declaration, which is in effect through at least April 15, at its meeting Wednesday.

The declaration allows more flexibility and authorization for the City Manager to take actions to help protect the health and safety of the community, through a number of means from limiting access to public places, to buying items or services related to health and safety without normal procurement procedures that can take additional time.

“We need to move fast and be nimble in our responses right now, as this is a rapidly evolving situation,” said Mayor Sally Russell. “This declaration should not inspire concern, but rather, should assure the public that the City is taking every precaution possible to prevent the spread of this virus in our community.”

“My primary focus is to restrict the spread of COVID-19 and to maintain the health of our workforce so employees can continue to provide crucial City services,” said City Manager Eric King. “I have and will continue to develop emergency policies regarding the use of sick leave, vacation leave, telecommuting, meeting protocols, and more, which will be in effect for the duration of the emergency.”

While this emergency is in place, the City will not send shut-off notices or shut off water for non-payment of unpaid water bills and will not allow any permitted special events of more than 250 people.

To eliminate exposure and spread of COVID-19, and in support of state and federal guidelines for social distancing, the City has cancelled all advisory committee meetings and public, project-specific outreach meetings or open houses. City employees are encouraged to telecommute and to conduct meetings through online conferencing tools when possible. Disinfecting and cleaning operations have increased significantly in City facilities.

Currently, scheduled City Council meetings are expected to continue, but with social distancing modifications including increased space between chairs. This results is a smaller capacity in Council Chambers. The City strongly encourages livestreaming the meeting from home through www.bendoregon.gov/councilagenda. Anyone who wishes to communicate with the Council is also welcome to email council@bendoregon.gov.

Bend Police service response to COVID-19:

The City of Bend Police Department recognizes the need to follow State and Federal recommendations related to best practices associated with the spread of, and exposures to, COVID-19. Based on these recommendations we have evaluated and adjusted our services and response to calls for service. These decisions were made to follow social distancing guidelines.

Effective immediately, the City of Bend Police Department will be evaluating calls for service to determine if they can be handled by phone, rather than in person. We also encourage the public to utilize our online reporting portal for appropriate non-emergency crimes. For general police questions we request the public consider calling into our office at (541)322-2960, rather than visiting our police department. The police department will be suspending public finger printing services until further notice.

Future adjustments may be necessary in order to maintain the staff necessary to serve the citizens of our City. Our officers will continue to respond to emergency calls 24 hours a day and 7 days per week.

News release from Crook County Emergency Management:

As novel coronavirus – aka COVID-19 – continues to spread, local health officials have stressed that the risk to Central Oregonians remains low. Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year. Crook County does not currently have any positive cases of COVID-19.

Crook County Emergency Management, with the support of Crook County Court and the City of Prineville, today approved a County Emergency Health Declaration. The local Health Department supports this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the county response to this incident. This declaration will support the need for resources whether that is personnel or supplies. It is consistent with the State Health Emergency Declaration and the National Health Emergency the President announced earlier today.

Crook County and the City of Prineville wants you to know that in partnership with our local and neighboring Health Departments, Law Enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network (COEIN), and medical community, which includes St. Charles Health System, the situation is being monitored very closely and following preparedness plans that are in place for any outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus not only in Oregon but statewide and globally is ongoing.

Crook County Judge, Seth Crawford stated “It is our goal to continue our preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them”.

The leadership of the county and city respect the privacy of the community members and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members. With that being said the safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available.

The joint city and county preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster.

Local Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza - The CDC is recommending non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:

If you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.

Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.

Consult CDC’s travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.

Stay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.

It is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.

This week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people. The city and county strongly believe in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and needs to be followed.

There is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point. It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. The same precautions are suggested for any communicable disease.

Crook County Circuit Court & Jefferson County Circuit Court

The health and safety of all patrons and employees of the Crook & Jefferson County Circuit Courts are of utmost importance to the courts. We are maintaining regular communications with our state and local public health and emergency management professionals to monitor the developing situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In partnership with our state and local preparedness partners, we have developed a comprehensive response plan. We are taking all necessary and available measures to maintain a safe and sanitary space for all employees and patrons of our court.

The courts recognize that requiring people to congregate in close proximity for any period of time is now risky. Therefore, effective March 13, 2020, Crook and Jefferson County Circuit Courts have cancelled all jury trials through April 30, 2020, to be rescheduled as conditions allow.

All other court services remain available during normal business hours.

Need DMV service? Visit DMV2U.oregon.gov

March 13, 2020

SALEM – To help slow the spread of Coronavirus in Oregon, the Oregon DMV asks that customers consider using the many services available online rather than visiting a DMV office in person.

You can do these things 24/7 at DMV2U.Oregon.gov:

Renew registration for most vehicles – even if your tags just expired, you can renew online and print the receipt to take in your car as proof of registration.

– even if your tags just expired, you can renew online and print the receipt to take in your car as proof of registration. Update your address – if you move within Oregon, you must report your new address to DMV within 30 days.

– if you move within Oregon, you must report your new address to DMV within 30 days. Report the sale of your vehicle – if you sell your vehicle, you can take an extra step against future parking tickets and towing/storage fees on that car by reporting the sale to DMV online.

– if you sell your vehicle, you can take an extra step against future parking tickets and towing/storage fees on that car by reporting the sale to DMV online. Get a trip permit if your tags are expired or license plates are lost or stolen, or if you’ve just bought a car without current plates.

“We encourage people to avoid renewing their vehicle registration in field offices when nearly everyone can do it via our DMV2U website,” DMV Administrator Tom McClellan said. “Those most vulnerable to the virus – those age 60 and older or who have underlying health conditions – should especially reconsider an in-person visit to DMV at this time.”

Other less frequently used services are also available at DMV2U.

If possible, DMV also asks that customers reschedule drive tests until a later date.

Any time you need a DMV service, please first check at DMV2U.Oregon.gov to see if you can save yourself a trip to an office. You can also visit OregonDMV.com to see office hours, locations and wait times for most DMVs, and to make sure you have everything you need before your visit.

DMV also accepts many transactions through the mail, and our phone agents (503-945-5000) help people prepare for a DMV visit, if required.

If you visit DMV in person

Most of our larger offices station employees near the front door to answer questions, check paperwork, and orient customers to the lobby/counter/testing areas. We are not turning people away who appear sick, but are preparing signage that helps educate customers about COVID-19 symptoms and preventive steps such as good hygiene.

“We are taking additional precautions with cleaning protocols and sanitation of employee/customer high-contact areas,” McClellan said. “If someone stays home from work due to illness, please don’t consider a trip to DMV as an acceptable activity. Stay home and get well, and don’t risk infecting others in public spaces like a DMV office!” said McClellan.

Del Norte,CO,03-24-2020 00:00,https://wildrivers.lostcoastoutpost.com/2020/mar/24/emergency-officials-prepare-potential-surge-cases/,Emergency Officials Prepare For Potential Surge of Cases Once COVID-19 Shows Up In Del Norte County,"Jessica Cejnar / Tuesday, March 24 @ 5:28 p.m. / Emergencies, Health, Infrastructure, Local Government Emergency Officials Prepare For Potential Surge of Cases Once COVID-19 Shows Up In Del Norte County

Though he sympathized with businesses having to close their doors and potentially lay off employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Warren Rehwaldt said the alternative could be horrendous for Del Norte County.

Speaking before county supervisors on Tuesday, the local public health officer said no one, Del Norte included, has the medical support to manage a wave of COVID-19 cases at once.

“We maybe one and a half hospital beds per 1,000 people in this county,” Rehwaldt said. “It’s probably less than that because the catchment area for Sutter Coast Hospital includes most of southern Curry County, all of Brookings. We don’t have anything in place to meet the demand if this virus gets out of control.”

In addition to giving a power point presentation prepared by Emergency Services Manager Kymmie Scott, Rehwaldt fielded questions from supervisors on a variety of topics. Those topics included the economy, the role local hotels and vacation rentals play in curtailing COVID-19’s spread and the availability to test for the virus.

Rehwaldt also discussed herd immunity, the need to keep those who work to maintain food, fuel, energy, water, sewer and medical services healthy. Del Norte’s Emergency Operations Center is currently at Level 2, he said, and is working on meeting the housing, feeding and medical needs of those who are most vulnerable.

In addition to calling for volunteers to build up a workforce to keep those services going, Rehwaldt said local emergency officials are preparing for a surge of possible COVID-19 cases and are trying to back up the medical system as much as they can.

“We’re not cut off from anybody,” he said. “This is not like a tsunami event where we’ll be on our own for weeks.”

Del Norte County has yet to see a positive COVID-19 case. As of 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, 37 tests have been administered to local individuals. The results for 31 have returned negative and six are still pending, according to the Public Health Branch.

Noting that more than 300,000 people in 190 countries have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization, Rehwaldt said the situation is changing by the minute.

Since Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on Thursday, Rehwaldt said he and other emergency officials are trying to establish a community mitigation strategy. He referred to the essential businesses that continue to serve the public, including grocery stores, banks, laundromats, gas station and pharmacies.

Hotels are essential for many workers who travel while they’re on a job, Rehwaldt said. However, he noted that it may be difficult to separate those who travel for work from those who are on vacation.

Vacation rentals are also questionable, Rehwaldt said in response to a question from District 2 Supervisor Lori Cowan.

Cowan said she has been fielding calls from constituents concerned about vacation rental bookings for spring break being cancelled due to the pandemic. But, she noted, many vacation rentals are used for traveling nurses.

Rehwaldt responded by saying there’s not much guidance available from the state on how to deal with travelers coming into the community.

“I don’t think we can deny travel outside of a general order from the governor to forbid travel,” he said. “From what I’ve heard from other jurisdictions, enforcement of that is really tough. We’re all waiting for better guidance.”

District 1 Supervisor Roger Gitlin also brought up an economic concern.

“Some people believe the cure for this COVID-19 virus is actually worse than the actual virus itself,” Gitlin said. “Businesses are shutting down, layoffs are ongoing, who’s going to pay for that? People are suffering. How do you address the economic factor, if at all? Or are you going to take the position that you’re going to do what’s best as a medical official?”

Citing global reports, Rehwaldt said the virus has a death rate of 1 to 3 percent. In Italy the death rate grew to about 10 percent, he said.

Del Norte County experiences about 270-300 deaths per year under normal circumstances, Rehwaldt said. The county could lose 10 times that as a result of the virus, he said, adding that the virus has forced his in-laws who are brewers and restaurant owners in Southern California from having to lay off their employees.

“As a medical professional, in knowing what I know about this virus, I can’t advise anybody not to follow the governor’s directions at this time,” he said.

Eventually, health officials hope enough people will have been infected with the COVID-19 virus that communities will develop herd immunity, Rehwaldt said. But, he said, it could take an estimated 50 to 70 percent of the population to build up that immunity. If health professionals did nothing to try to slow the virus’s spread, it could take eight to 12 weeks for it to replicate and jump into enough people to achieve herd immunity and many would die in the process.

Following Rehwaldt’s appearance before supervisors Tuesday, Scott told the Wild Rivers Outpost that her office and a plethora of volunteer teams were preparing for that potential surge in local COVID-19 cases. The Del Norte Office of Emergency Services is receiving shipments of personal protective equipment and other supplies from the state weekly. Volunteers make sure those supplies get to the local first responder agencies and healthcare facilities, Scott said.

OES has also been working with the Disaster Animal Response Team and the Del Norte County Fairgrounds to make sure people’s pets will be taken care of when the virus begins making its rounds in the community, Scott said.

Residents can prepare for that eventuality by ensuring their animals are up to date on their vaccines, have tags if they require special medication and have enough extra food set aside, she said.

“If they have to go for the hospital for awhile or even if they’re ill at home and can’t care for pets, we want to make sure people’s pets are taken care of,” Scott said.

People should also ensure their personal lifelines are in place, making arrangements with friends, family or neighbors to ensure their loved ones are cared for if they get sick, Scott said.

“If that’s simply not an option, the county has structures in place for that anyways, but we don’t want that system to be overwhelmed either,” she said. “We’re all going to have needs and we’re all going to have things to give and we all need to help each other out in the next few months.”

Scott is also in the process of putting together a call bank of volunteers to help people get needed information. One idea, she said, was a phone-a-friend service to maintain a social connection for those who are weathering the pandemic on their own.

“Everybody can do that,” she said, adding that KCRE and KPOD came up with the idea of a five-person challenge. “I’m just challenging everybody to call five people they wouldn’t normally reach out to and say ‘Hi.’ I think that’s awesome to get going as a regular part of this response effort.”

EAGLE COUNTY — A third case of coronavirus in Eagle County has been confirmed Tuesday as the number of cases in Colorado reached at least 15.

The patient is an Eagle County man in his 30s and an investigation is underway. The case is presumptive positive, which means test results haven’t yet been confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Gov. Jared Polis declared a state of emergency Tuesday in Colorado that he says will allow him to take measures to slow the spread of the new coronavirus and limit economic disruptions.

Polis said he directed the state to pursue financial measures to help employees in the health, food and nursing home industries, as well as state workers, to stay home if they get sick — rather than expose others to the virus because they’re worried about losing their jobs.

In addition, Polis said he’s seeking more testing capacity to rapidly identify and isolate cases of the virus. Private diagnostics firm LabCorp is now performing coronavirus tests that will complement state and federal testing, he said.

“Our top priority is protecting public health and our vulnerable populations which is why we are taking swift bold action,” Polis said. “Our administration’s response will be guided by the science and lessons learned from the countries and states that this virus arrived in first. We will continue to be proactive and working around the clock to protect public health and safety with an eye towards preventing the need for more drastic measures that result in social disruption.”

The state is also opening a drive-through testing clinic in east Denver on Wednesday, and more locations are coming. Users need a doctor’s order, Polis said.

The emergency declaration “does not mean Colorado isn’t open for business. We are,” Polis said.

About the local cases

The three presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in Eagle County are:

A female visitor to the county in her 50s. Health officials say she was exposed during international travel. “The patient was not hospitalized and is recovering in isolation. The patient is working with public health officials in the ongoing investigation to identify people that may have had close exposure,” Eagle County health officials said in a news release.

A female county resident in her 70s who has no known contact with an infected person, but does have a recent history of travel in U.S. “The patient had mild symptoms, was not hospitalized and is recovering in isolation. The patient is working with public health officials in the ongoing investigation to identify people that may have had close contact with her,” Eagle County health officials said in a news release.

A male in his 30s. The patient’s primary residence is unknown, as well as his travel history and when the infection was detected.

To ensure local resources are able to focus their time and attention on current and future case investigations, all additional cases in Eagle County will be reported through the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment website. Local officials will continue to share important community safety information at http://www.ECEmergency.org.

Those with questions about COVID-19 can call the CO HELP Hotline at 1-877-462-2911.

Schools among safest places

For now, it’s business as usual in Eagle County Schools, Chief Communications Officer Dan Dougherty said.

Eagle County’s health department has suggested that they don’t close school.

“Schools are among the cleanest and safest places for people to congregate. Almost every square inch is cleaned and sanitized regularly,” Dougherty said.

“Our custodians are our heroes,” Dougherty said.

Students also have constant adult supervision.

“They recognize when a student is not feeling well, and the student can be isolated,” Dougherty said.

In the case of coronavirus, fever is the primary symptom.

“If students develop a fever at school they’re sent home. If you’re sick, stay home. If your kids are sick, keep them home,” Dougherty said.

A pandemic plan on the district leadership team website outlines how to prepare, prevent and protect yourself from exposure to COVID-19.

Prepare, Prevent and Protect

Preparing for the possibility of an outbreak. That includes ramping up online learning and creating other opportunities

Prevent the spread by asking people to stay away if they have symptoms. The school district created more hand-washing stations, sanitizing buildings, classrooms, and buses after every route.

Protect by following the directions of public health.

State response

Polis said he’s spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to stress the need for “exponentially” greater testing in Colorado.

The governor directed the state Department of Labor and Employment to explore paid sick leave, unemployment insurance or wage replacement for those in the affected industries. He also asked the business community to voluntarily offer sick leave to limit the spread of the virus and avoid significant economic disruptions.

State employees in quarantine or isolation can work from home and, if ill, use paid sick leave, Polis said.

He also directed the Department of Revenue to allow drivers 65 and older — part of populations most at risk — to renew their licenses online rather than in person at Department of Motor Vehicle Offices. Seniors usually must renew their licenses in person to have their eyesight tested.

Officials say a person in suburban Douglas County visited a DMV office last week before testing positive. The county says the risk of infection for clients at the office and for workers there is low.

On Monday, Polis said Colorado will require health insurers it regulates to fully cover testing, under certain conditions, for the coronavirus.

Several local governments are closing government buildings or limiting public access while non-essential services are being cut back in an attempt to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.

Officials in both Ingham and Eaton Counties declared states of emergency on Monday afternoon, joining the city of Lansing and Delhi, Lansing. Meridian Township declared a state of emergency on Tuesday.

East Lansing declared a state of emergency last week.

Declaring a state of emergency empowers those governments to take emergency actions and could eventually unlock federal disaster-relief funding.

Essential services, including including fire, emergency and wastewater management services, will continue to operate, according to news releases sent Monday.

City of Lansing

All city of Lansing facilities, including City Hall, District Court 54A and community centers, will be closed to the public beginning Tuesday.

The court will be closed through April 3. Other city buildings are closed indefinitely until further notice.

Some city employees are working from home. Contact information for city departments can be found at lansingmi.gov/coronavirus.

Trash and recycling pick up plus wastewater management services are continuing as first responders are using alternate response plans to prioritize emergencies and more serious crimes.

“Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we take care of ourselves, our family, our friends, our neighbors and our co-workers by practicing social distancing and flattening the curve,"" Lansing Mayor Andy Schor said in a statement.

Delhi Township

Closures of all Delhi Township buildings begin Tuesday, March 17 and will last until April 6 pending further announcements from the township. The township's non-essential services are suspended.

Beginning Tuesday, most Delhi Township staff will be working remotely. Added cleaning measures and social distancing, the practice of avoiding large groups and maintaining six feet of distance from another person, will be implemented for those who remain in the office.

Questions may be emailed to TempClosure@delhitownship.com. As always, residents should call 911 for emergencies.

“Out of an abundance of caution, and to minimize the potential exposure of our staff and residents to COVID-19, we have decided to close all Township buildings and facilities to the public,” Delhi Township Manager Tracy Miller said in a statement. “Between now and April 6, we will continue to monitor the situation and update residents as things evolve.”

Lansing Township

In Lansing Township, boards and committees will still meet, but access to the administration building will be limited.

“Lansing Township is taking the necessary precautions to protect our residents and staff. COVID-19 is a very serious ailment and we are taking bold steps to help prevent transmission,” Supervisor Dion’trae Hayes said in a news release.

Anyone with questions can contact Lansing Township staff from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at 517-485-2272.

Michigan bars, restaurants, gyms, theaters ordered to close by 3 p.m.

Meridian Township

All Meridian Township buildings are closed to the public. They are tentatively scheduled to reopen on April 6.

As an exception there is restricted access available for emergencies at fire stations and the public safety building. All public safety services are operating at full capacity.

“As an organization, we take great pride in offering a high level of service to our residents,” Township Manager Frank Walsh said in a statement. “This makes the decision to close our offices to the public so difficult, but at this time it is the right decision to protect our team and our visitors.”

The Harris Nature Center, Meridian Historical Village, Meridian Senior Center and Nokomis Cultural Heritage Center are also closed. The Meridian Senior Center has extended its closure to Monday, April 13th.

All Township events and meetings have been canceled, including the Meridian Township Farmers' Market.

Residents who need help with services during the closure can reach the limited staff that will be available in township offices by calling numbers listed in a post at meridian.mi.us/COVID-19. There’s more information about closures, cancellations, resources and preventive actions at that website as well.

Ingham County

Most county departments and services, including the parks department, will be closed or suspended beginning at 8 a.m. Tuesday.

Essential services, including the sheriff's department and the community health centers, will continue operating. The health department will be closed to the public, as will 55th District Court. The county's circuit and probate courts will remain open, however.

During that time, Poloncarz enacted a State of Emergency to begin at Noon, and announced that all Erie County schools would be closed on Monday.

“We are entering uncharted waters,” Poloncarz said, before calling on locals to be in solidarity with one another.

""The key is social distancing."" — JONATHAN LORD, Flagler County Emergency Management director

County Emergency Management Director Jonathan Lord told the commission that President Donald Trump had recently advised people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. The number of people that authorities are saying constitutes too many has changed rapidly — an example of how quickly recommended responses to the virus have shifted.

""Something I’ve told you is probably wrong by now because things are changing so quickly,"" Lord said toward the end of his presentation.

""This time last week, the guidance was mass gatherings of more than a 1,000 should not occur,"" Lord said. ""This weekend it became 250, as of the president on the news an hour ago, it is down to 10. ... He really wants people to stay home. He’s saying avoid bars, food courts, restaurants.""

And that doesn't just go for people who feel sick: People can contract COVID-19 and remain asymptomatic — showing no symptoms — all the while passing the disease to others. So it helps slow the disease's transmission if even people who feel healthy avoid unnecessary gatherings.

Also over the weekend, Florida Department of Health-Flagler County Administrator Bob Snyder told the commission, the number of known cases in Florida jumped from 42 to 137; as of the evening of March 16, it was 142.

But, Snyder said, ""I feel like this weekend was pivotal,"" because in the county and local cities, he said, ""actions have been taken to cancel small or large gatherings.""

""That’s what mitigation is all about,"" Snyder said. ""If that continues, I think we have a high, high chance ... that we’ll be successful in watching this virus die. ... We’ve got to keep that up, and encourage that in addition to everyday good hygiene.""

Still, he said, ""At some point in time, we will have our first confirmed case of COVID-19. When? Don’t know.""

But the state will soon — likely by the end of the week — have the capacity to test as many as 625,000 people, he said, with assistance from LabCorps, Quest, various other private testing labs and AdventHealth's lab in Orlando.

""We know what to do. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we’ll be on it."" — BOB SNYDER, Florida Department of Health-Flagler administrator

That will likely mean an uptick in known positive cases.

Once there's a positive case in Flagler County, the health department will take the lead: Its nurses will interview the patient to determine who they've been in contact with over the 14-day period in which they may have contracted or been shedding the virus, and will then contact those people to see if they're sick and who they've been in contact with.

That process is called ""contact tracing,"" and the health department is accustomed to using it for other illnesses, such as HIV.

""I want our community to know, we know what to do,"" Snyder said. ""We are used to doing this. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we’ll be on it.""

Lord and Snyder have will also hold a phone meeting with assisted living facilities and nursing homes later this week, Lord said, as seniors are at heightened risk from the disease. The facilities have already started reducing visits, Snyder said.

The county is also shutting down nonessential services, such as the county library, while working to provide help to people who had relied on county services that are being reduced or shut down — for instance, the county's adult daycare program, or meals provided at the Wickline Center (which are now being delivered to individuals' homes). The virus could still be circulating as late as July or August, Lord said, citing the president's televised speech.

Although residents should be prepared, Lord said, it's unhelpful to hoard supplies.

""People should be prepared and stocking up, but the whole hoarding three years' of toilet paper, whatever motivates people to do that, this is not the time to do that,"" he said.

For people who become sick with COVID-19 and have to self-isolate, Lord said, ""We can fill in that gap to get people toiletries and meals if they’re locked in.""",state_of_emergency,549.0,39.2955,-103.0767

This Declaration of Emergency will permit access to local emergency funds, Federal and State assistance and adjustments to policies, procedures, and ordinances to ensure the public’s health and welfare.

The City of Fountain is encouraging all residents and visitors to practice appropriate social distancing and personal preventative measures, and follow El Paso County Public Health, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations on how to best respond to the COVID-19 situation.",state_of_emergency,29804.0,38.6888,-104.6829

Sheriff Chris Swanson, said fewer people are on the streets, committing fewer crimes, and judges are lowering bonds in some cases, allowing some men and women who are nearing the end of sentences or who are charged with nonviolent offenses to get out of the lockup -- sometimes with a tracking device.

Swanson said county sheriffs have also been put on notice by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer that additional releases could be ordered “on the bottom for certain crimes"" but said much of that work has already been done here.

Two weeks ago, the sheriff said he also directed that some arrested people would not be booked into jail because of the potential for overcrowding as the number of cases of coronavirus rises.

“The courts have worked well with us ... (and) there’s less people coming in the front door,” Swanson said.

No inmates have tested positive for COVID-19 but an area in the jail, which was built with a capacity of 580, is available for use as a quarantine area that could house 30 inmates or more if necessary, he said.

The Michigan Department of Corrections recently began preparing quarantine areas in various state prisons to house prisoners who test positive for COVID-19 or who need to be isolated while awaiting test results to determine if they’ve contracted the virus.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases among Michigan prison inmates nearly doubled to 13 Thursday, March 26, up from seven the day prior.

“As far as the police calls, on the street ... we have a really cool vibe. Of course, there are people making bad decisions -- domestics and some other violent crimes -- but the call volume is significantly reduced,” Swanson said. ""We are not doing traffic stops in the Sheriff’s Office unless it’s an obvious drunk driver or someone clearly breaking the law.

“We’re not out there trying to make anybody’s life more difficult -- certainly not to compound the problem by having interaction that doesn’t have to take place. People follow the law, they don’t have to worry about interacting with a law enforcement officer,"" Swanson said.

The city now has 29 cases of the virus that causes COVID-19, up from 12 reported at the end of last week, and recently saw its first death as a result of the outbreak, according to the L.A. County Department of Public Health.

On Tuesday, City Council members voted unanimously to extend the period set to expire March 31, amid a meeting where scores of tenants voiced concerns about whether emergency eviction protections would cover them for the next month.

A halt on evictions for those affected by the virus will remain in place, along with all of the city’s emergency orders. That includes the closure of nonessential retail businesses, public facilities and hiking trails, a blanket ban on residential rent increases, the suspension of some street-sweeping restrictions and free rides on the local bus line.

Gatherings of more than 10 people in close quarters are also prohibited.

Glendale’s emergency period now extends beyond Los Angeles County’s, which is set to expire April 19.

Aligning the end date with the end of the month was done to create a more consistent cycle and reduce confusion, according to Mayor Ara Najarian.

The date “could very well be amended again,” Najarian said. “That depends on how the number of cases either grows or becomes controlled.”

Across the county, there have been at least 1,465 cases and 26 deaths tied to the virus.

On March 16, Glendale declared a local state of emergency just hours after a local hospital confirmed the city’s first case of the virus. Since then, the number of confirmed local cases has risen steadily, adding to a rapidly rising county toll.

Since then, the city has followed the state and county’s lead, implementing social-distancing requirements, including a state mandate that requires residents to stay home except for essential needs.

Najarian said he doesn’t think all local residents are taking the increasingly stringent restrictions seriously enough, adding that he thinks the next seven days will be critical in terms of whether the area can contain the virus or see a large spike.

“It’s not like the German bombing of London, where everyone congregates together. It’s a different attack that we’re under,” he said. “Each and every one of us could be a carrier, and many people just don’t get it.”

The city is currently weighing whether to further restrict access to parks, he added.

It mandates the closure of indoor malls, shopping centers, playgrounds and all nonessential retail businesses and prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people within enclosed spaces.

Grocery stores, restaurants offering takeout, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, laundromats, social-service providers and media outlets will continue operating.

Residents are permitted to leave their homes to buy groceries, care for relatives and for medical needs.

“Changing our routines is difficult, but it will protect our most vulnerable populations while also ensuring the health and safety of our city,” Glendale Mayor Ara Najarian said in a statement. “It is our responsibility to take care of our children, parents, grandparents and our community.”

Shortly after the announcement, Najarian tweeted, “Many activities are permitted, many businesses are still permitted to operate.”

L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti stressed that “this is not a lockdown,” adding that people can walk around their neighborhoods and hike as long as they practice social distancing.

L.A. implemented stricter rules than the county, requiring all nonessential businesses that require in-person attendance to cease operations and banning gatherings outside the home, with exceptions for both.

The rules are not just guidelines. Residents who don’t follow them could potentially face a misdemeanor charge or fines.

The back-to-back orders arrived after the virus that causes COVID-19 claimed its second life in L.A. County, in the Pasadena area. To date, there are four confirmed cases in Glendale and at least 231 across L.A. County. Burbank confirmed its first case on Thursday.

The order went into effect at midnight on Thursday for residents and is currently slated to last until April 19. Businesses have an additional 24 hours to comply.

Effective Tuesday evening, following a unanimous vote by City Council members, landlords of residential properties are prohibited from implementing rent increases through at least April 30.

Rent hikes that went into effect before the moratorium was adopted will still be valid, as per a recommendation by City Atty. Mike Garcia.

Increases noticed by landlords prior to the order, but that have not gone into effect, are prohibited from going forward, according to city spokeswoman Eliza Papazian.

Last week, the city halted evictions of residential and commercial tenants who can show they are unable to pay rent because of economic hardship related to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 during the emergency period. Tenants will still have to pay any rent they missed but will have a six-month period to do so.

Los Angeles went further, temporarily stopping all no-fault evictions for residential and commercial tenants. This past Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom halted evictions of renters affected by the virus statewide.

Glendale’s emergency period was previously extended until March 31. That date was extended to the end of April on Tuesday during a council meeting, which was held as a teleconference.

“People are very scared, [council members] are at least aware of that. That’s a good first step,” said Karen Kwak, a renter and member of the Glendale Tenants Union.

“It’s still not going to be enough, and I hope that they consider further action,” Kwak said.

Kwak surmised that thousands of local residents might not be able to pay rent come April 1 or the following month, depending on how the crisis develops and individual circumstances.

There is understanding from the California Apartment Assn., a large trade group representing the rental housing industry, that there is a need for protections applied specifically to those who suffered economic setbacks related to the virus, according to Fred Sutton, who handles the group’s public affairs for L.A. County.

“We’re all impacted in some way by the virus, but we’re not all impacted financially the same way,” Sutton said.

He said the group supported renters providing proof of economic hardship, something the city requires for tenants to receive the emergency eviction protection. The rent increase moratorium applies to all residential units in the city, according to Papazian.

Council members adopted the moratorium after a stream of residents called in asking city officials to consider rent forgiveness, or what many called a rent freeze, while residents grapple with new unemployment or increased medical bills in the wake of the pandemic.

Some called for a freeze of mortgages and utility bills as well.

Glendale has 29 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to county health officials. The virus has claimed one local resident’s life. Countless others are dealing with jobs lost due to nonessential business closures mandated by the city and county last week.

Haley Hopkins, a 23-year-old Glendale resident, told the council that she lost her job as a self-described blue-collar worker in the arts industry as a result of the pandemic.

According to Hopkins, the renter protections offered by the city are not sufficient to meet the crisis at hand, echoing several others who called into the virtual meeting to advocate for rent forgiveness.

“I’m truly wondering how any one of you think I’m supposed to pay my rent without being able to earn an income,” Hopkins said during the public comment portion of the meeting.

She surmised that many residents will have trouble paying back missed rent and that landlords might be able to find loopholes in the rules.

Kwak is continuing to work from home as a freelance editor and proofreader but said she lost a part-time contract job with a law firm that was essential for making ends meet.

While she has savings to last through April, she worries about what will happen in May if she can’t find a way to supplement her income.

Exempting struggling residents from rent is not as simple as declaring it so, according to several Glendale officials.

Implementing a rent freeze could violate state law and the Constitution, issues that would need to be addressed before a proposal could be considered, according to Garcia.

It might take federal action — such as a one-year mortgage forgiveness or stimulus funding — to make such a measure feasible, Mayor Ara Najarian said during the meeting.

On Wednesday, Newsom announced that several major banks and institutions had agreed to a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments.

Families should not lose their homes because of COVID-19. Very pleased that Wells Fargo, Citi, JPMorgan, and US Bank have agreed to a 90 day grace period for mortgage payments for those impacted by #COVID19.



A big sigh of relief for millions of CA families. — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) March 25, 2020

Councilwoman Paula Devine said she was worried about the domino effect that rent forgiveness could have, pointing out that landlords might consequently be unable to pay their mortgages, which could then have a negative impact on lenders.

“We need to be fair to both the renters and the landlords,” Devine said.

Sutton called the proposal “reckless and naive,” adding that workers connected to the property business — like management companies, plumbers and gardeners — would suffer serious losses as well.

Glendale Tenants Union members are aware that there’s no simple solution to the problem but that tenants are feeling desperate, Kwak said.

She’s heard “buzz” about attempting a rent strike, something the tenant’s union hasn’t advocated.

“This is the mood of a lot of tenants across the city,” Kwak said.

Shortly after Gov. Gary Herbert asked Utahns to immediately begin staying home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall issued a similar directive to residents in the capital city.

While compliance with Herbert’s sweeping guidance is voluntary for residents statewide, the emergency order Mendenhall signed Friday carries the same restrictions but makes compliance mandatory for city residents. And any violations are eligible for a charge of up to a class B misdemeanor.

“This is about saving lives,” she told The Salt Lake Tribune on Friday. ""It’s about saving the lives of our neighbors and co-workers and family members. And this short-term pain will lead to a longer-term gain for us, and I think shorten the duration of the impact from a public health and economic perspective for the community and the state.”

As part of the order, anyone currently living within the capital city must stay at home except for essential travel, starting at midnight on Friday.

In defining what the city considers essential, the order refers to the governor’s request, which listed caring for family members, friends and pets; seeking emergency services; obtaining medications, medical services and food; and donating blood.

Mendenhall said in a news release that people who are already practicing appropriate precautions, including social distancing, will not experience a big impact to their day-to-day lives. People can still exercise, go to parks, hike on trails and go to grocery stores, she noted.

As for businesses, the mayor said she doesn’t anticipate the order will force any more to close. “But I do hope that more businesses will operate only with essential personnel,” she said.

Salt Lake City’s order incorporates all the directives in the governor’s plan but adds a few city-specific items, including new measures at the Salt Lake City International Airport. Effective immediately, no one will be allowed inside the airport without an airline ticket or airport badge. All passenger drop-offs and pickups must be done curbside or in the parking garage, with all individuals other than travelers remaining in the vehicle.

Under city code, a violation of any emergency order carries a class B misdemeanor charge, meaning the standards are not stricter than they would be in a different situation, the mayor noted.

In a statement late Friday, Salt Lake City police said they won’t arrest anyone for going to work on Monday and that they “strongly encourage voluntary compliance” with the governor’s guidelines.

“We are relying on businesses to take responsibility for their employees and the general public,” the statement read. “Every effort should be made to telework.""

If teleworking isn’t possible, that person shouldn’t be working — unless they are essential, according to the statement.

The city order is in place until April 11, at which point the City Council could extend it. Herbert’s less-strict “Stay Safe, Stay Home” directive will be in effect statewide until April 13. And he said it will work only if everyone shelters in place, adding that home is the safest place for everyone right now. The directive starts Monday for businesses.

“There’s an expectation that all of us will follow these directives, and we need to do that,"" he said. “... All of us need to work together if we’re going to get through and survive, and in fact, not only survive but then be able to thrive in a few weeks.”

Many of his specific requests already have been communicated by state leaders in previous weeks. But the governor said his intent Friday was to put forth a message “of emphasis and reinforcement” of those best practices at a time when Utah’s total confirmed cases of COVID-19 have risen to 480 and a second Utahn has died of the virus. Those are the latest numbers released by the state Department of Health on Friday.

Asked why he chose not to issue an order similar to those announced by 23 other states as of Friday afternoon — including Colorado, Idaho and California — Herbert said he thought this was “a more positive route.”

“We think we have enough fear about this without adding to it,” he said, arguing that a “shelter-in-place” order sounded like a World War II effort.

Herbert emphasized that the state will continue to look at data about the spread of the virus and how various measures are affecting it. If those numbers look different in a week, he said, the state could consider stronger measures.

As part of his directive, Herbert is asking Utahns to not attend any gatherings with anyone outside their household. Children shouldn’t be attending school and they shouldn’t be having play dates or going to public playgrounds, he said.

Residents should not dine out, except for getting takeout food or delivery, he said. He encouraged Utahns to help businesses by ordering meals up to three times a week or by buying gift cards. Leisure driving is OK, he said, but cautioned people to “think in terms of what can you do at home first.”

Herbert said Utahns can still hike, walk their dogs and jog — but asked residents to keep their distance from others. And public amusement parks, public swimming pools and gyms and fitness centers are off-limits, he said.

While it’s OK to visit a park, Herbert cautioned that people have a tendency even in open areas to congregate. And he asked Utahns to go to state parks only in the counties where they live. The national parks policy is still under review by “the folks in Washington, D.C.,” Herbert said.

Officials will coordinate programs to help people experiencing homelessness find shelter and to limit their exposure to the virus, he said. His directive states that “individuals without a home may move between emergency shelters, drop-in centers and encampments"" and that law-abiding encampments of fewer than 10 people should not be disbanded by state or local government, and the city’s order incorporates that exemption.

Herbert stressed that Utah is “not closed for business.” He said business is slower now and unemployment is up, but the state’s Workforce Services will try to connect those who need employment with jobs.

And state officials are working with lawmakers to find help for the business community, he said. At the same time, business owners and nonprofits need to do what they can to accommodate employees, he added.

“They need to know they’re coming to a safe environment,"" he said. “If they’re sick, the presumption is that they’re sick. This is not something they’re faking.”

Salt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson said Friday that county leaders would likely issue their own guidance after stakeholders meet Saturday.

“I would expect when we finish tomorrow, we’ll have a lot of overlap between the [governor’s] suggested piece,"" she said, “but maybe take it a little bit further.”

One difference could be adding an enforcement mechanism, like criminal penalties, for those who violate the order, Wilson said.

She mentioned “egregious” violations of the current public health recommendations, such as the large groups showing up at Salt Lake City International Airport to greet returning Latter-day Saint missionaries or hosting parties at parks. Wilson said, “That has to stop.”

“We’re at the point,"" she added, “that we do need a heavier hand.”

However, Wilson said, putting into place a stay-at-home order for Salt Lake County residents wouldn’t be easy since so many in the county work elsewhere, such as Davis County.

“The challenge is, I think those arrangements can be made,"" Wilson said, “but time is of the essence, and this virus is not giving us a lot of time.”

She said she hopes county leaders can come together to take an evidence-based and data-driven approach to the orders they hand down, so leaders are making decisions based on a common framework.

Before Friday, Summit County was the only one to issue a stay-at-home order in the state. The restrictions there — which, like Salt Lake City, limit nonessential travel and instruct residents not to leave their home except for necessities, such as food or doctor appointments — began Friday at midnight and will be in place until May 1 throughout the county.

Before issuing her emergency proclamation, Mendenhall said in a video Thursday that she was working with state and county leaders toward a statewide mandate but noted she was prepared to act alone and to “act soon” if that move didn’t come.

“We know that we’re in a critical time,"" she said, “and that the decisions we make to isolate ourselves as individuals and to make that as a directive as the public is absolutely going to set the trajectory for how long the economic impact lasts and how far and deep this virus comes in contact with our public.”

Both Mendenhall and Wilson said Friday that they are supportive of the direction the governor has taken. Utah County officials also agreed with the governor, they said in a news release, and did not issue additional restrictions or add enforcement mechanisms.

Rep. Paul Ray, who sits on the state’s coronavirus task force, reiterated in an interview with The Tribune on Friday that the governor’s directive is not a mandate. The Clearfield Republican said he doesn’t believe such orders are advisable.

“Quite honestly, we lose a lot of people to the flu,” he said. “I guess we’ll see in the end.”

Ray said he believes Mendenhall wanted the governor to make the politically fraught decision to issue a shelter-at-home order, but argues it’s her decision to make.

“It’s a lot easier if you get him to make the call and you don’t have to answer to the public,” he said. “But we get elected to make the hard calls.”",shelter_in_place,379.0,38.0303,-107.3103

Items to be discussed, according to the posted agenda — tinyurl.com/vx5klgyn — include orders issued by various levels of government, medical capacity for handling the disease, a business-assistance update, an individual-assistance update, work on homelessness, rental and mortgage housing assistance, “what this means for Longmont” and “local needs.”

However, there were no written staff reports for any of those items attached to the publicly posted agenda.

City spokesman Rigo Leal said in a telephone interview that City Manager Harold Dominguez said no agenda-related reports have been written because “things are changing hourly” and a report could be obsolete by the time the meeting convenes.

City staff said in a Monday night news release that it will host the meeting virtually via a WebEx videoconferencing system so that council members can be briefed remotely by the city manager and other staff on issues facing the city, Boulder County and the region, without being physically present in the same room.

Staff said that will honor Boulder County Public Health’s physical distancing recommendations for meetings.

The action comes after careful consideration of the ongoing situation and is consistent with recommendations of Boulder County Public Health and the Boulder Office of Emergency Management, according to a statement.

Louisville Mayor Ashley Stolzmann signed the declaration Sunday morning, which will allow the city to access emergency funds, federal and state assistance, adjustments to policies, procedures and ordinances to ensure the public’s health and welfare as well as remove barriers to support the city’s response to the pandemic.

“Given the critical need for immediate response, this declaration positions the city to access additional resources to protect public health and safety and support the continuity of government during this challenging time,” Stolzmann said in a statement.

The declaration states the COVID-19 pandemic is causing “widespread human and economic impacts” on Louisville and the cost and magnitude of responding to and recovery from the pandemic may be far in excess of the city’s resources.

“It is appropriate and in the interests of the public health and safety of the city and its residents to rapidly address community spread of COVID-19 and subsequent cascading impacts, such as economic distress, and to further protect the health and safety of the public declaring an emergency in the city of Louisville,” according to the statement.

City officials previously closed the city’s Recreation and Senior Center, the Louisville Public Library, and the Museum and Arts Center.

“The decision to close these facilities was made in an effort to reduce community transmission of the virus consistent with recommendations from partner organizations,” the statement reads.

Louisville Police Department, City Hall and Coal Creek Golf Course will remain open.

The Senior Meal Site will offer curbside service during the closure beginning Monday.

Louisville City Council will meet Tuesday, but members of the public are encouraged to watch the meeting on Comcast channel 8, or the web stream at bit.ly/3aX410Z. Those interested in submitting a public comment can email council@louisvilleco.gov.

The two-page declaration describes the spread of the virus around Colorado, United States and the world, as well as local responses to the outbreak.

In light of the pandemic and the ongoing response of local agencies, the document “activates local and inter-jurisdictional disaster emergency plans and authorizes aid and assistance under those plans.”

Adams later said the declaration had specifically activated the city’s continuity of operations plan and other plans impacting individual city departments, but that the effects would likely go unnoticed by most residents.

Loveland’s emergency operations center was also activated by the declaration, though Loveland Fire Rescue Authority chief Mark Miller clarified it is currently a “limited activation” with partial staffing.

For now, the purpose of the declaration is to open “pathways” for action and aid requests in case the virus does emerge in Loveland, Adams said.

“In other emergencies, declarations have allowed us to apply for federal and state aid,” he said. “We’ve now created a pathway for all of that if it needs to happen in the future, even though, right this second, there’s no aid that’s been made available to us.”

Adams said city staff are also tracking funds spent on projects related to the outbreak in the hopes that the city may be reimbursed through grants later.

As of 5 p.m., no Loveland residents had been reported sick with the virus, and the only confirmed Larimer County case, a Johnstown woman, remained quarantined at home as of yesterday.

The city of Mountain View proclaimed a state of emergency Thursday afternoon in response to the new coronavirus, clearing the way for swift action against the spread of the virus and easier access to state and federal funds.

The announcement was quickly followed by closures of the Mountain View Senior Center and recreation facilities through April 5.

Mountain View joins numerous cities and counties in California to make the emergency declaration as the proliferation of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has become a global pandemic. There have been 66 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County, according to public health officials.

In the proclamation, City Manager Kimbra McCarthy wrote that the spread of COVID-19 has imposed ""extraordinary"" requirements and expenses on the city, causing it to divert resources away from day-to-day operations. It also means the city may have to pursue ""potential isolation and quarantines of residents, employees, businesses and public safety workers"" affected or exposed to the coronavirus.

The emergency declaration is effective immediately, and will stay active for the next seven days. This gives time for the City Council to ratify the the city manager's proclamation and extend the state of emergency.

Precautionary measures include a blanket cancellation of all city events through the end of the month, including the cancellation and postponement of performances at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts. Hand sanitizer stations have been placed at city facilities throughout Mountain View, and city staff are recommending that all residents frequently wash their hands and commonly used surfaces.

""The city's foremost priority is to maintain the health and safety of the community and our employees,"" Mayor Margaret Abe-Koga said in a statement accompanying the declaration.

On Friday, city officials announced that several sports recreation facilities will be shut down starting this weekend. The Mountain View Sports Pavilion, Whisman Sports Center and the public pools at Eagle Park and Rengstorff Park will be closed from March 14 through April 5.

Winter classes hosted by the city through the recreation department will be canceled from March 14 through the end of the winter session. A pro-rated refund will be given to customers with canceled class dates.

Prior to the state of emergency, numerous city programs and services had already been canceled, scaled back or modified to safeguard against the spread of coronavirus. Library events through March 14 had already been canceled, and the Senior Nutrition Program -- run by the nonprofit Community Services Agency of Mountain View and Los Altos (CSA) out of the city's senior center -- had shifted its popular daily lunch program to take-out meals-only.

As of Friday, city officials say that the senior center will now only be open from 11:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. for the Senior Nutrition Program -- effectively closing it for all other services through April 5. All evening rentals at the senior center from Monday through Thursday will be moved or canceled, while Friday and weekend evening rentals will be honored.

The city has also sought to use video conferencing or outright cancellations of in-person meetings deemed non-essential, and has modified any trainings and gatherings hosted by the city to include ""social distancing"" -- often described as a 6-foot buffer between individuals.

The proclamation shows escalating concerns about coronavirus, starting with the first reported county case on Jan. 31 and the first COVID-19 death in the county on March 9. That same day, county health officials had announced a ban on all mass gatherings of 1,000 people or more in Santa Clara County.

But the trigger for the city's emergency declaration was a pronouncement by the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic -- the first such announcement since the swine flu in 2009.

The city has also announced the following events have been canceled as of Friday morning:

● April 3 Concert on the Plaza

● April 4 Volunteer Fair

● April 17 Concert on the Plaza

● April 18 Deer Hollow Farm Spring Tour

● April 25 Spring Parade",state_of_emergency,537.0,39.7748,-105.0567

That patient, as well as two new cases announced Saturday by the Pueblo Department of Public Health and Environment, now brings the Pueblo County total of positive COVID-19 cases to 10. The new cases are unrelated and involve two women, ages 19 and 71, and a 26-year-old man.

""Compared to a week ago, Pueblo has three times more positive COVID-19 test results. I expect the more people we test and the more test results we receive, Pueblo will continue to see more positive COVID-19 cases,"" Randy Evetts, the department’s public health director, said in Saturday’s announcement.

Also Saturday, President Donald Trump and the federal government approved a request from Gov. Jared Polis declaring Colorado a major disaster.

""Colorado is now eligible to receive additional federal resources to help address the global epidemic impacting our state, the nation, and the world,"" Polis said.

Of 90 tests administered at the fairgrounds on March 19, 37 are negative and 50 are pending. A person from Douglas County tested positive, bringing the total to two. One sample wasn’t able to be processed.

Of 254 tests administered overall in Pueblo County, 139 are negative; 101 are pending; and 13 are positive, including 10 from Pueblo County and three from surrounding counties. The health department said it gets results reported to them within seven or more days.

Otero County has two people who’ve tested positive for COVID-19, and Fremont County has one. No positive cases have been reported in Bent or Custer counties, according to the state health department.

As of Saturday, there have been 1,734 cases reported statewide, with 239 hospitalizations and 31 deaths, including one fatal case in Pueblo County: an 81-year-old woman.

""I continue to urge community members to follow social distancing of six feet or more from each other to stop the spread of this virus and protect our family, friends and neighbors,"" Evetts said Saturday.

There’s hope that message is resonating with the public: 96% of Coloradans are avoiding large gatherings, according to a three-day survey of 45,000 residents by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment this week.

Other findings include:

• 97% are washing their hands with soap and water more frequently.

• 70% are working from home.

• 35% are stockpiling food and other household items.

Half of the respondents reported a combination of symptoms indicative of generalized anxiety over the last two weeks.

Kind Connections, a statewide answering service to combat the uncertainty, anxiety and depression in Colorado brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, says it has 100 volunteers statewide answering calls.

Gov. Wanda Vázquez Garced made the emergency declaration in a Thursday press conference to utilize the National Guard’s resources to combat the spread of the new coronavirus on the island.

National Guard personnel will be stationed at the Luis Muñoz Marin International Airport in San Juan — as well as the cruise ship port area — to screen all arriving passengers for symptoms, as the activation is “not a standard emergency response mission,” a defense official said.

The governor also voiced frustrations with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over delayed results of tests for a handful of patients under observation.

The declaration also contains an order to postpone or cancel all mass gathering events until the end of the month.

Currently, Puerto Rico does not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19, but the governor said the steps being taken are preventative measures, aimed to stem the spread of the disease. According to the Puerto Rico Department of Health, there are five cases under investigation as of March 10.

“The CDC told us that it received the tests on Tuesday morning, and they began to process them, so today the 48 hours [for results] are met,” Rafael Rodriguez, Puerto Rico’s health secretary, said at the press conference, according to Caribbean Business. “[The CDC] promised that the results will be available tonight or tomorrow.”

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the CDC will provide state and local jurisdictions increased resources to combat the growing numbers of cases.

The total appropriations package contains $8.3 billion in relief with $560 million going to “states, localities, territories, and tribes,” a press release stated.

""Our state, local, tribal and territorial public health partners are on the front lines of the COVID-19 response,” said Dr. Robert Redfield, CDC director, in the release. “The action we are taking today will continue to support their efforts to increase public health capacity where it's needed most.""

Puerto Rico will receive $5.8 million in federal aid, according to the CDC.

""State and local health departments are on the frontlines of responding to the COVID-19 outbreak, and we are deeply grateful for their work,"" said HHS Secretary Alex Azar in the release.

On Feb. 29, 2020, Gov. Vázquez Garced established a coronavirus task force to examine potential cases.

Puerto Rico is now the second state or territory to activate its National Guard components, following New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s decision earlier this week to activate Guardsmen. Cuomo’s decision centered around a “cluster” of COVID-19 cases in New Rochelle, New York.

Several other governors have signed emergency declarations, an important step in ensuring rapid activation and deployment of National Guard units, if needed.

National Guard units fall under the control of each state’s governor, while the National Guard Bureau is assisting the CDC-led, interagency effort to combat the outbreak at the federal level.

Earlier this year, the governor activated the Puerto Rico National Guard in response to a series of earthquakes off the coast of the island, which caused widespread damage, power outages and water insecurity.",state_of_emergency,266.0,37.6892,-108.0318

The Latin trap artist Bad Bunny disappointed some fans on social media after he posted a selfie of himself tightly hugging friends.

On Sunday, hours before the shutdown order was to take effect at 6 p.m., San Juan, the capital, bustled as usual. The crowds at Plaza Las Américas, the biggest shopping mall, seemed perhaps a bit thinner. The island’s schools had already been ordered closed for the next two weeks.

Cellphones buzzed in unison on Sunday afternoon with the sound of an emergency alert about the curfew.

“It seems like a pretty logical and fair measure to take at night,” one resident, Alexander Caraballo, said of the curfew after standing in a short line on Sunday at a homeopathic pharmacy in the town of Manatí to stock up on vitamin C and echinacea. The shop was letting customers in one at a time to avoid needless contact.

“I’ve personally been isolating myself, and taking preventive measures, and being disciplined to avoid contagion,” said Mr. Caraballo, 25, a freelance fashion and portrait photographer. At the supermarket, cashiers wore gloves, he said. “I’ve run into several acquaintances, worried but getting ready.”

Five coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Puerto Rico so far, though more are suspected. Ms. Vázquez, who assumed the governorship in August and is now running for the seat, appeared determined to avoid a deadly disaster similar to Hurricane Maria in 2017, which killed an estimated 2,975 Puerto Ricans. Her administration has already been criticized for getting slow Covid-19 test results from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Rafael Rodríguez Mercado, the health secretary, resigned on Friday.

One-fifth of Puerto Rico’s population of nearly 3.2 million is 65 or older, and the island’s health system struggled after Hurricane Maria. Puerto Rico has also been dealing with the aftermath of earthquakes that sent thousands of fearful people to sleep outdoors.",lockdown,266.0,37.6892,-108.0318

Story updated 1:25 p.m. Tuesday

Ridgway Town Manager Preston Neill has signed an order declaring a local disaster within the town, in response to concerns about community spread of coronavirus.

State law allows Neill to sign this order, which is only temporary. The town council will need to consider a more permanent order if this is a measure lasting more than seven days. The council’s next scheduled meeting isn’t until April 8.

Neill said he’ll be working with Mayor John Clark and Town Attorney Bo Nerlin with council members in the coming days to schedule a special meeting on this subject and also to formulate a policy for virtual meetings - something Ouray County and the City of Ouray have decided to do using Zoom. The move is to comply with health authorities’ recommendations to limit gatherings to fewer than ten people at a time, and also to provide space between members of the public to avoid contagion.

The town is also delivering a formal response plan to staff, to guide the town’s response to different stages of the pandemic. The city of Ouray and the county have already decided to close their offices to the public.

Gov. Jared Polis this afternoon ordered the closure of all Colorado restaurants and bars to in-person dining in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.

Polis also ordered the closure of theaters, casinos and gyms.

Meanwhile, state health officials announced that the state’s number of confirmed coronavirus cases has jumped to 160. Colorado has completed test results on 1,200 people since Feb. 28, but there are many still pending. Officials have not yet offered a demographic breakdown of the new cases due to the high volume of testing being processed by the state lab. As of this morning, Ouray County did not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Here in Ouray County, both the Ouray City Council and the Ouray County Board of County Commissioners unanimously declared disaster emergencies this afternoon in moves that grant them broad power. City Administrator Justin Perry ordered the indefinite closure of the Ouray Hot Springs Pool and Fitness Center this morning, as well as the closure of City Hall to the public through at least April 3.

In addition, all county buildings will be closed to the public as well, effective 8 a.m. Wednesday. This closure does not include the courts at this time.

With news that the Colorado National Guard will be assisting with COVID-19 testing in Telluride beginning on Tuesday, San Miguel County health officials also issued their own alert that they believe the virus is already there in the community and asked anyone who has visited or lives in San Miguel County to isolate themselves and minimize contact with others.

This announcement comes after state officials asked anyone who has visited Eagle, Pitkin, Summit or Gunnison counties to do the same thing - to stay away from others in case they have been exposed. These mountain counties have the highest number of positive coronavirus tests in the state, outside the Denver metro area.

San Miguel County Public Health Director Grace Franklin cited the similar characteristics of San Miguel County to these other communities, attracting lots of international ski tourism, which have experienced a ""disproportionate spike"" in cases compared to other areas of the state.

These recommendations include avoiding public spaces, not shaking hands avoiding mass gatherings or gathering in group settings, and practicing social distancing of at least six feet in between people. They also advise staying home if you feel sick and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces frequently, including cell phones, as well as washing hands thoroughly with soap and water.

Ouray County commissioners and City of Ouray officials are also scheduled to meet with Ouray County Public Health Director Tanner Kingery on Monday for a briefing on coronavirus here in Ouray County and to discuss next steps. The City Council's meeting is at 1 p.m. at the Massard Room at City Hall and the emergency meeting with the commissioners is scheduled for 4 p.m. at the 4-H Event Center in Ridgway.

Story updated at 3:15 p.m. Sunday

Ridgway and Ouray school districts will close for two weeks in an effort to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

In an email sent to the school community just after 3 p.m. today, Ridgway Superintendent Susan Lacy said both districts were closing with the support of Ouray County Public Health. The districts had originally planned to close on Monday and take the day to evaluate future steps. Lacy, though, said she had a telephone conference with Ouray County Public Health Director Tanner Kingery, Ouray School District Lead Supervisor Kenneth Nelson, County Emergency Manager Glenn Boyd and County Commissioner Ben Tisdel.

""County officials confirmed that the response to the virus necessitates a shift from a reactive to a proactive model. Things are moving quickly and it is important to reevaluate on a continual basis,"" Lacy wrote in the email.

That means both districts will be closed through March 27, followed by spring break, which runs from March 28 to April 6. Lacy said officials will re-evaluate the situation during spring break and determine if classes will resume on April 7.

Lacy said the Ridgway School District will create eight days worth of daily learning plans for each week — Tuesday-Friday of this week and Monday-Thursday of the week of March 23 to ""provide as much support and a sense of normalcy for our students as possible, during what I know is a difficult moment for all of our families.""

Lacy said teachers will roll out class-specific activities that can be done at home to support continued learning and stability for students.

Ouray County commissioners, meanwhile, have called a special meeting at 4 p.m. Monday to receive updates on the coronavirus, discuss next steps and policies and provide direction to staff.

As of Sunday afternoon, there were a total of 131 positive cases of COVID-19 in Colorado but no confirmed cases in Ouray County.

----------------

Ouray County does not have any cases of coronavirus at this time, according to information updated Sunday by the state health department.

The total number of confirmed cases in Colorado at this time is 101. Gunnison County announced its first case last week, and Mesa County announced its first case on Saturday.

Anyone with questions about testing is asked to call their primary care doctor at this time. There is also a statewide call line established for questions about COVID-19, 1-877-462-2911, and an email address, cohelp@rmpdc.org.

Over the past week, Gov. Jared Polis encouraged communities to limit opportunities for germs to spread and slow contraction of the illness. Local events, including concerts and gatherings, have largely been canceled or postponed in response to a request from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment requesting all community events with 250 or more people be canceled or postponed.

Polis also warned older people not to travel to Colorado’s mountain communities, citing concerns about cases identified in Pitkin and Eagle counties with community spread of the illness and the lack of resources to respond to the sickness in more rural areas. The first death attributed to COVID-19 was announced Friday - a woman in her 80s in El Paso County.

After other ski resorts across the state announced they would close due to coronavirus concerns, Telluride Ski Resort announced it would close ""effective immediately"" for the season. The announcement came Saturday night after Gov. Polis told Colorado Ski Country USA late Saturday afternoon he would be issuing an executive order requiring the state's ski resorts to close for a period of time, according to Telluride Ski Resort's statement. The gondola will continue running to Mountain Village for pedestrian traffic for the time being.

Smaller events here in Ouray County were postponed or canceled in an abundance of caution - including everything from the Ouray Elks Lodge St. Patrick’s Day Dinner and bingo to a Ridgway Town Council candidate forum. Some local churches, including St. John’s Episcopal Church in Ouray, have responded to requests from church leaders to cease in-person services for the time being to limit possible exposure. Local banks announced ramped-up cleaning efforts and encouraged customers to use online banking resources.

Ouray Hot Springs Pool Manager Kentee Pasek said employees are taking extra care to wipe down handrails, door knobs and other high-touch surfaces.

“We are doing everything within our capability of being able to be as safe and clean a facility as possible, but that’s something we’re doing anyway,” she said.

She reminded patrons that the pool adds chlorine to the mineral water at levels recommended by state health officials to keep the water safe.

Pasek said the decision if and when to close the pool would be made by Ouray County Public Health Director Tanner Kingery. ""That is not something I would do, it is something that Tanner would do and make that call.""

However, Kingery said he provides guidance and he's using the same set of public health recommendations from the state for the pool as he's using for similar facilities like schools and childcare centers. It's up to the pool management to make that decision and that they are free to take preemptive measures.

Neighboring school districts have announced extended spring breaks or closures for weeks. On Friday, Ridgway Superintendent Susan Lacy announced the district would be closing on Monday to students for cleaning, and indicated the closure might be longer and is under consideration. Ouray School District issued the same decision on Saturday morning, with Lead Administrator Kenneth Nelson indicating the school is keeping an eye on the situation and will make announcements of longer closures by Monday evening if they are warranted.

Both school districts have canceled their spring sports and practices until at least early April, in response to a decision made by the Colorado High School Activities Association. CHSAA limited attendance at the state basketball playoffs, in which the Ouray boys’ team participated, citing concerns that a safe distance between attendees (six to eight feet recommended distance) couldn’t be accommodated.

The tournament was canceled after the state announced gatherings of 250 or more people should end and the venue hosting the tournament, the University of Denver, said it could no longer host the games.

Some local businesses have responded to community members who have decided to keep their social distance by advertising delivery or take-out meals. Others in the community have offered to shop for older residents or those with health concerns who don’t want to risk exposure.

At least one Ouray County nonprofit organization has also offered to assist those who need help with supplies - the Ouray County Woman’s Club.

Members of the Woman’s Club who have a medical reason for isolating themselves during this time (or have symptoms of illness) can e-mail womansclubouray@gmail.com for help with errands, groceries, mail, medications and other assistance.

Anyone who is willing to help members with these needs can also email the same address and offer assistance to others in the community.

At least one business in Ouray County has chosen to close entirely. The Wiesbaden Hot Springs Spa & Lodgings announced on its website this afternoon it will close through May 1, saying it is ""taking the current health threat of the Covid 19 Virus very seriously."" Officials there said they will perform previously planned improvements in exterior rooms and spa areas during the closure.

""We apologize for any inconvenience related to this decision, but are confident in your understanding,"" a message posted on the Wiesbaden's website read.

The Ouray Public Library announced it will waive fines, or deliver books within the city limits for the rest of the month or help patrons with online resources. Anyone can email the library at ouraypl@gmail.com or use the online catalog to look up resources, as well as call the library at 325-4616.

According to state public health officials, 813 people have been tested for the illness in Colorado as of noon on Saturday. Of those 813, 101 tested positive and 712 tested negative.

Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 or meets the specific criteria for testing is encouraged to contact their primary care provider for next steps. According to information from Kingery last week, tests are transported to the state lab in Denver via courier. State public health officials have said their current turnaround time for those tests is less than 72 hours. If a test is presumptive positive at that time, it is reported by the state health department. Those positive samples are then sent on to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta for verification. Negative test samples are returned to providers who authorized the tests, so they may take longer to communicate results to patients.

The CDC has issued several advisories about the illness, including one titled, ""Get your household ready for Coronavirus,"" available here.

Taylor Sienkiewicz / tsienkiewicz@summitdaily.com

FRISCO — In response to the rising cases of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, in Colorado, Silverthorne Town Council unanimously passed two resolutions Wednesday that would allow budget flexibility in case of an emergency as well as electronic participation in town meetings, if the need arises.

Town attorney Karl Hanlon explained during the council work session that putting both of these resolutions in place would give council flexibility in the event of an emergency, such as a local outbreak of the coronavirus.

Hanlon stressed the importance of the resolution allowing for electronic meetings. If there is an order from the governor that says no gathering in public places for the next 24 hours, for example, council could be in violation of the open meetings act if there was not a mechanism in place for council to meet remotely, he said.

The resolution acknowledges potential problems with video conferencing council meetings — including issues with presentations, the inability for council to read nonverbal language and general inefficiencies — and says the policy can be used only if Town Council adopts a resolution declaring a local disaster emergency or the town manager declares such an emergency.

The second resolution allows the town manager to use up to $100,000 of town funding in response to an emergency. The resolution details that if the governor declares a statewide emergency related to the coronavirus and the town needs to expend resources not previously budgeted, the town or the town manager would be authorized to use town funds for the interest of public health and safety for the town, the state and the county.

Breckenridge Town Council discussed similar actions Tuesday regarding remote video conferencing. Town Manager Rick Holman said this would be brought back to council at the next work session March 24. On Thursday, the Town Council called a special meeting to discuss COVID-19 as it pertains to events and determined it would be in the town’s best interest to limit gatherings that occur on town property — or are run by the town — to 50 people, and to recommend that town businesses follow suit.

Town attorney Tim Berry presented an emergency ordinance at the special meeting that gives Holman broad powers to do what he thinks is necessary to address public health concerns, including the authority to close any town-owned facility and to use town funds as necessary. The ordinance was passed by council unanimously. As an emergency ordinance, there will be no second reading.",None,18396.0,39.6564,-106.0871

Yuma County has officially issued a declaration of emergency over COVID-19. Yuma County Supervisor Board Chairman Tony Reyes says board members approved the declaration this morning. Reyes says the Board’s decision was made as a proactive reaction to a serious public health threat.

""We’re trying to get ahead of this to be able to assure the public that the county and the department, the health department of the county, and every employee of the county is ready to take care of our residents, of our public,"" Reyes said Friday. ""And we want to make sure, if need be, and actions need to be taken that are drastic, we’ll be able to do that.""

Diana Gomez, director of the Yuma County Public Health Services District, assured the public that even though an emergency declaration has been made, there is no reason for anyone to panic.

""As of this moment, and it’s a rapidly evolving situation, there is no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Yuma County,"" Gomez said. ""When we become aware of a confirmed case we will notify the public.""

Gomez added that at this time there are also no “presumed cases” of COVID-19. She said a presumed case is when someone is believed to be showing symptoms of the virus, but test results have not yet confirmed it.

Gomez says that as testing becomes readily available, more cases will be discovered. She says that does not mean there is more disease in the county, but rather that more people infected are being discovered.

Officials reiterated that the best thing people can do to protect themselves is to wash their hands often and stay away from situations where they can be exposed.

""Given the growing spread of this virus in our city, state, and country, I am declaring a state of emergency in the City of New Haven to protect the public health of our residents. There is no doubt that COVID-19 will continue to spread in our community, and I will take every measure appropriate to limit exposure to our residents. I have also made the decision to close City Hall to the public tomorrow, and indefinitely. We are curtailing all activities except critical functions until further notice. City employees that are not critical to operations will be notified that they should not report to work. Over the next several days, our team will be evaluating our employee safety and operations protocol, in addition to increasing options for teleworking where possible. If you are a member of the business community, I strongly encourage you to have only essential employees report to work, provide options for employees to telework and do what you can to support paid leave and reduce any chance of further spread of COVID-19.

As of this morning, we have a second confirmed case of COVID-19 and a third presumed case. The two New Haven residents had been exhibiting systems of COVID-19. Since they initially did not meet the CDC travel criteria, they were not tested but told by the New Haven Health Department to self-isolate as a precautionary measure. One of these two residents' symptoms worsened, and the individual admitted themselves to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where they were tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. The other individual is considered a presumptive case and has been hospitalized as of this afternoon, but we do not yet have laboratory confirmation of COVID-19. Both individuals will continue to be monitored by the New Haven Health Department, and we will continue to inform you of any updates regarding the situation.""",state_of_emergency,568144.0,41.3112,-72.9246

Town Hall will still be open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. Building permit-related and other services will be provided via the drive-through window located on the Mitchell Street side of the Millsboro Town Center at 322 Wilson Highway.

Customers are encouraged to use the town’s website, www.millsboro.org, to make payments.



The CALEA-accredited Millsboro Police Department will continue to provide services around the clock, and the town’s water and sewer employees will continue to report during normal business hours and whenever needed.



“As an incredibly business-friendly city – after, of course, doing its part to keep its employees and town residents safe – Millsboro wants to do what it can to help developers, contractors, and others continue to move forward with their projects during this economically challenging period,” said Town Manager Sheldon P. Hudson. “At a time when many organizations are shutting down completely – sometimes out of necessity – we believe the city’s current and future business community will appreciate the Town of Millsboro’s efforts and will remember them when the economy inevitably starts booming again.”

RELATED: CORONAVIRUS BY COUNTY/CITY: Cases jump to 2,900, infant diagnosed in Santa Rosa

But the declaration did not come without controversy, with the council debating for nearly two hours to what extent they were allowed to impose restrictions on citizens to protect public health.

The state of emergency that ultimately passed does several things, including:

— Closing City Hall and encouraging all transactions to take place via the drive-thru window, and removing online payment fees to encourage online payments

— Giving law enforcement officers authority to break up groups of more than 10 people that gather in public places

— Strongly encouraging citizens to reduce movements to essential travel to provide food and care for loved ones, to obtain necessary items for the care and maintenance of the home or business, or for other necessary supplies

The declaration does not close public parks, does not impose a curfew and does not enforce a shelter-in-place order, though it does encourage citizens to restrict their movements to only necessary trips.

The local state of emergency allows the city to apply for state and federal financial aid to help recoup losses caused by the pandemic.

The vote came only a couple of hours after the Department of Health revealed that a 2-year-old Santa Rosa boy is one of four county residents to be confirmed positive for the coronavirus. In Escambia County, there were 10 confirmed cases, as of Tuesday morning.

Councilwoman Shannon Rice had several objections to the declaration, including words in the document directing citizens to ""comply"" and ""obey"" with necessary emergency orders.

Rice was also worried about a line that allowed ""all emergency authority for protection of the lives and property of the people of this city and continuity of government with a minimum of interruption,"" saying it would turn the city into a ""police state"" — something Police Chief Tony Tindell adamantly denied would happen.

""We’re not going to violate people’s rights,"" Tindell said, addressing the council. ""We’re here to serve and to protect, and that’s simply what we’re going to do.""

Tindell added that two of his officers were having to self-quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.

City of Milton attorney Eric Meade, who attended the meeting remotely via telephone, said words like ""comply,"" ""direct"" and ""obey"" were appropriate in the extraordinary circumstances.

""I would tend to agree in every other setting, but every citizen’s liberty is dependent upon not inflicting injury or harm upon any other citizen, and in this situation that has particular force,"" Meade said. ""Because it is precisely the gathering into groups of greater than (10 or more people) that constitutes a clear and present danger under these circumstances, where we have a contagion that is making its way through the population.""

Mayor Heather Lindsay said she believed certain words were necessary in the declaration to relay the correct tone during a time of crisis.

""I can’t help but think back to when I’m with my children and they were very young, and they don’t know all that could make them unsafe, and you are very direct with your child and you may be harsh even with your child if you think your child is unsafe and your child doesn’t know that,"" Lindsay said. ""It’s not our role to treat our citizens as children, but it is an analogy to correlate that when you’re in a state of emergency, there’s a different tone than when there’s not a state of emergency.""

Rice maintained her opposition to the declaration, and was the only council member who voted to oppose it. Councilwoman Peggi Smith was not in attendance.

""This is not the time to infringe on our citizens’ rights. People have died to defend these rights,"" Rice said. ""It’s not the time to hand over our city to the city manager, the police chief and the fire chief. We should stay involved, and that’s what I feel that this is doing. This is handing this city over to non-elected officials, and that is not what our citizens want.""

The state of emergency lasts through April 30.

The increased health protection levels are aimed at the continued efforts to protect Team Eglin’s people, resources and to preserve mission capability.

“It is imperative that all Eglin personnel understand their individual status during this outbreak as either mission or non-mission essential,” Cain said. All members of Team Eglin are encouraged to consult with their commander, director or supervisor for specific mission-essential clarification.

At the same time, the increased health protection levels will impact many of the facilities and functions on base. Personnel and residents should expect our on-base facilities to decrease activities or reduce hours of operation as conditions warrant.

Installation emergency services will continue to operate. The 96th Medical Group’s Eglin hospital will be available for acute, emergency and inpatient services.

“The safety and well-being of Eglin Air Force Base and all of our families is my top priority,” said Brig. Gen.

HAINES CITY — City commissioners in Haines City approved a state of emergency declaration at their meeting Thursday night in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The order allows the city manager power to evacuate certain areas of the city, declare curfews, establish quarantine for certain areas of the city or make those areas accessible only under specified conditions.

The move prohibits price-gouging on merchandise, goods or services at more than the normal average retail price. It allows emergency procurement procedures and helps the city establish temporary procedures during the state of emergency related to utility services billing and service cutoffs so that nobody's utilities are shut off.

The state of emergency applies to the entire incorporated limits of Haines City.

“Thank you to everyone in our local community who is cooperating with the national and state guidelines of social distancing,” City Manager Deric Feacher said in an email. “And our local businesses and organizations who are working long, arduous hours to ensure our community is protected and prepared.”

Feacher also asked the community to be “considerate of our elderly and high-risk community.” The city manager said the city commission and administration is monitoring “all resources” to ensure good decisions are being made on the city's part.

“If there is no need for you to be out, please stay home and away from large gatherings. Your dedication to lowering the curve is essential to stop the spread of this virus,” he wrote.

The city's communications and marketing manager, Stephanie Snively, added that Haines City officials are “playing it by ear, staying calm, monitoring federal, state and county agencies.”

Although the commission approved the declaration Thursday night, the city hasn't yet moved on any of the provisions.

Snively said the city's social media page is “very active” and keeps residents in the know of what is closing.

“The governor's office has said bars, nightclubs and beaches have been closed,” Snively said. “We don't have many bars, we definitely don't have any nightclubs, and there are no beaches here.”

Haines City sent a press release late Friday afternoon noting the city will follow Gov. Ron DeSantis' order that all restaurants and bars are closed to onsite food and alcohol consumption. Businesses can still operate takeout, and takeout with alcohol that goes with meals, as long as the patron can present proper ID for age.

As of Friday, city tennis courts and walking trails were still open as long as there are no more than 10 people within six feet of each other. It was also announced that the library and events centers are closed.

Also noted was that the City Commission meeting scheduled for April 2 was canceled.

As part of the city's state of emergency declaration, special meetings of the City Commission to address emergency management issues may be held on the call of the mayor or the city manager with no less than 24-hour notice to each member of the City Commission and the public.

LAKELAND — Lakeland commissioners have unanimously declared a state of emergency before the first coronavirus case is confirmed in Polk County.

The city commission unanimously approved the measure late Monday afternoon, following similar actions by President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis.

The measure will activate Lakeland’s emergency operations plans. It also gives City Manager Tony Delgado the authority to possibly evacuate or quarantine areas of the city, declare curfews and prohibit the exploitative sale of goods — such as disinfectant sprays or hand sanitizers.

“It really allows us to start putting some of those wheels in motion,” he said.

The state of emergency status will allow the city to seek possible reimbursement from both the state and federal offices for the cost of supplies obtained to help prevent further spread of COVID-19.

Lakeland announces closures

At the end of Tuesday, the city’s Parks and Recreational department will close the following facilities to prevent the spread of COVID-19:

• Lakeland Public Library

• Larry Jackson Branch Library

• eLibrary

• Simpson Park Community Center

• Kelly Recreation Complex

• Coleman-Bush Building

• Gandy Pool

• Lake Mirror Complex

• Splash Pad at Barnett Family Park

These facilities will be closed starting Wednesday for 30 days, according to Lakeland spokesman Kevin Cook, or until further notice.

Lake Mirror Complex’s rental center will be closed to walk-ins, but available via phone at 863-834-2280 or email at lakemirrorrentals@lakelandgov.net.

The city’s other parks and recreational facilities remain open at this time, including Cleveland Heights Golf Course. However, all tournaments slated for the next 30 days are being rescheduled.

“Even though staff is diligently disinfecting and cleaning surfaces, we ask that you use these facilities understanding the suggested safety considerations associated with the COVID-19 challenge,” reads the city’s statement.

All events scheduled at the RP Funding Center through April have been canceled of their own accord, according to Delgado.

In addition, all public events scheduled at city park facilities will be canceled for a 30-day period starting Wednesday.

Outdoor weddings at city-owned facilities are currently being allowed to continue as scheduled with minimal staff support. The use of Lakeland’s indoor facilities for weddings or receptions will be canceled beginning as of March 22.

Cleaning supplies limited

In a Tuesday email, Delgado told Lakeland city staff that cleaning supplies remain at a premium and are a challenge to obtain.

“ ... We anticipate that in three weeks the supplies will be significantly tasked,” he wrote.

An area triage plan is being enacted to better direct Lakeland’s cleaning and sanitizing efforts, according to Delgado. Top priority will be given to Lakeland Police Department and Lakeland Fire Department buildings, followed by the offices of essential community services including Lakeland Electric, water, wastewater and sewer utilities.

Delgado announced that non-essential city staff will aim to fully transition to a work-from-home status by end of business on March 23. Non-essential employees personally affected by school closings or other enacted COVID-19 measures, without the means to mitigate it, will be allowed to utilize sick and vacation days on a case-by-case basis.

Future COVID-19 decisions

While the commission’s decision to declare a state of emergency was unanimous, several city officials voiced concerns. Commissioner Stephanie Madden said she has full confidence in Delgado and his staff, but was hesitant to hand off so much power.

“When I see that the city manager will have the following powers, certainly we don’t know if they will be required, but it does give me pause,” Madden said. “It’s not my job to do your job, but I know I will be held accountable for how this plays out.”

Commissioner Scott Franklin, mayor pro tem, said the state of emergency declaration “essentially allows the city manager to just about declare martial law” and wanted other mechanisms set in place.

Delgado assured the commissioners that similar decision-making power had been entrusted to him in the past, such as during Hurricane Irma in 2017. In the days following Irma, the city manager said a curfew was declared for two nights in parts of Lakeland to protect businesses that were left without electrical power.

“We would not make a decision of that magnitude without at least conferring with the city commission,” he said. “You will be held accountable as am I.”

Commissioner Sara Roberts McCarley asked Delgado to provide the commissioners with twice daily briefings with the latest updates on the coronavirus and what’s happening.

Commissioner Chad McLeod said he would be willing to have once a week commission meetings through March, then re-evaluate the situation.

Delgado said he will schedule time for twice daily updates and weekly meetings, though no official vote or action was taken.

“This is an unusual challenge as the health care providers said we have never gone through or never even contemplated going through this,” he said. “We want to be nimble and flexible but we don’t want to take you out of the loop. I guarantee you that will not happen.”

City Attorney Palmer Davis said the commissioners could call an emergency meeting if necessary to respond to an emerging COVID-19 crisis with only a few hours notice while staying in compliance with the state’s Sunshine Law. Lakeland officials would be allowed to attend the meeting via teleconference or other remote technology if sick or traveling, according to Palmer, given the circumstances.

McCarley also pointed out the commission has the sole authority to declare the state of emergency has ended.

Cook has created a special COVID-19 section on the city’s website at lakelandgov.net. It provides a running list of the city’s latest actions and FAQ on the virus.

LIGHTHOUSE POINT CORONAVIRUS UPDATE: Due to the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, a Declaration of Emergency was issued today for the City of Lighthouse Point by Mayor Glenn Troast.

As per the declaration, City Hall, the library and the Building Department are closed to the public until further notice.

Consistent with an executive order issued by Gov. Ron DeSantis today for Broward and Palm Beach Counties, effective Friday, March, 20, at 10pm, all restaurants, cafeterias and other food service establishments in Lighthouse Point are mandated to cease all on-premises service. However, these establishments will be able to continue to operate their kitchens for delivery or take-out services. The order will be in effect until March 31, 2020, but may be renewed.

City Hall will still provide phone assistance Monday to Friday, 8am-4pm, at 954-943-6500.

All City recreational and library programs, including senior activities, are cancelled until future notice. For now, library materials may still be reserved online 24/7 or by phone, Monday to Friday, 10am-4pm. Details on reserving materials and library online resources, including eBooks, can be found on the library’s website.

DeGroff Park and Exchange Club Park are closed until further notice, and hours of operation at Frank McDonough Park and Dan Witt Park are subject to change.

The Building Department will still allow approved permits to be picked up, but arrangements must be made one hour in advance by calling 954-943-6509 for instructions. New permit applications are being accepted. They can be submitted Monday to Friday via the drop box located at the front door of the Building Department, or see the list of acceptable permit applications being accepted electronically. There will be no fee to drop off new permit applications.

The March 24 special meeting of the City Commission, and the March 24 regular meeting of the City Commission are cancelled. The acceptance of the results of the March 17 election and the organizational meeting of the City Commission will be rescheduled to a future City Commission meeting.

All April meetings of City boards and advisory committees, and the Code Enforcement Special Magistrate, are canceled.

The Lighthouse Point Tennis Center Pro Shop and pavilion are closed until further notice, and use of the tennis courts is limited to members of the Tennis Center and Lighthouse Point residents only.

The issuance of all special event permits, including garage sale permits, is suspended until further notice.

The City will not be accepting requests to rent or use City facilities for any reason other than confirmed governmental or emergency purposes until further notice.

The Declaration of Emergency for Lighthouse Point will be in effect for as long as the State of Emergency for Florida is in effect, unless modified or terminated earlier.

Since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, the Lighthouse Point Fire Department has changed its procedures, and is prepared to respond to any COVID-19 calls.

Firefighter-paramedics are taking stricter personal protective precautions, and are trying to limit exposure to crew members by having one person make patient contact. They have also increased their decontamination procedures of vehicles, equipment, and personnel if they have been exposed to a patient that meets the COVID-19 criteria.

There is increased communication with county dispatch to identify the homes of residents who are possibly infected with COVID-19, so first responders can take the necessary precautions for future calls at those addresses.

In order to prevent cross-contamination in the rescue vehicles, the driver’s cab has been sealed off from the patient’s compartment.

The Fire Department is continuing to train and update its personnel with the latest information and protocols involving COVID–19.

The city’s contracted waste hauler, Waste Management, has temporarily closed its residential call centers (while maintaining electronic customer communications), but at this time, there is no impact to scheduled residential collection service.

Another effort to combat COVID-19 began on Thursday, when Broward Health opened a drive-through COVID-19 testing site in Pompano Beach, behind the Festival Flea Market on Sample Road. Testing will be by appointment only.

Individuals must be prescreened and meet testing criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) and the Department of Health. To schedule a time, patients must first get a written prescription from a physician, and then call the Broward Health line at 954-320-5730 from 7am to 7pm to register. Those who qualify will be required to present a photo ID, the written prescription and the registration confirmation number.

The city of Marco Island has declared a state of emergency to ensure the health and safety of residents and visitors amid the coronavirus pandemic.

""This proclamation shall activate the disaster emergency plans applicable to the city and shall be the authority for the use or distribution of any supplies, equipment, materials and/or facilities assembled or arranged to be made available,"" according to the declaration.

The proclamation, made during Monday's meeting, authorizes City Manager Mike McNees to take appropriate emergency measures.

""This declaration activates your disaster emergency plans in exactly the same way you would do so for a hurricane,"" McNees said. ""It delegates to the city manager certain emergency decision making authority should we be in a position where City Council was unable to meet.""

Vice-chair Jared Grifoni asked McNees to explain what else would the declaration allow him to do.

""It would give me the ability to establish curfews, limit the sale of alcohol [...] and call the National Guard,"" McNees said

McNees said it is unlikely he will have to call the National Guard but he pointed to the possibility of cancelling all events sponsored by the city.

A sign at the entrance of the police department building, where the city's community room is located, read that people should come to the City Council meeting only if necessary and encouraged residents to watch the meeting online.

A city employee was observed disinfecting common surfaces in and outside the room prior to the meeting.

And: Seafood fest, business expo canceled in Marco Island amid worldwide coronavirus outbreak

Earlier on Monday, Collier County commissioners declared a local state of emergency as the novel coronavirus continues to spread, joining a growing list of local governments in Florida that have already done so.

Commissioners held an emergency special meeting at the commission chambers to discuss responses to COVID-19 and receive an update from county officials about the current situation in Collier.

Among other things, Collier will shut down league play, for things like Little League, at county facilities; cancel, postpone or limit county programs with more than 50 participants; and scrap non-essential meetings, such as advisory committee, planning commission or neighborhood informational meetings.

The city of Naples also declared a local state of emergency Monday due to the coronavirus outbreak and set up a COVID-19 hotline.

President Donald Trump on Monday issued guidelines that called for people in the United States to avoid social gatherings of more than 10 people and to limit discretionary travel.

Gov. Ron DeSantis on March 9 declared a state of emergency that would broaden his powers to respond to the novel coronavirus, including allowing him to deploy National Guard troops if necessary.

The city also canceled the farmers' market, among other events.

""Based on the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control that public gatherings in excess of 50 people be curtailed, I have made the decision to suspend the operation of the Wednesday Farmers Market for this week,"" McNees wrote in an email on Monday.

On Tuesday, the city announced the cancellation of all organized programming at Mackle Park, city special event permits to be held at city-owned locations, committee meetings and this month's code enforcement magistrate hearing.

Special event permit applications will not be accepted between March 17 and April 1

""The city is assessing locations which have large gatherings of people, such as recreational areas, houses of worship for trending and policy changes,"" according to the city news release.

The city last week canceled several events and services out of abundance of caution amid the worldwide coronavirus outbreak, according to top city officials.

Pizza with the Police and a CPR class, both scheduled in March, and fingerprinting services were canceled as three Collier County residents tested positive for COVID-19.

""We are taking precautionary (measures) right now following CDC guidelines,"" said Chief Tracy L. Frazzano of the Marco Island Police Department on March 12.

Frazzano said the department is also having personnel issues.

""We do have some people that are actually out sick already.""

None of the department's staff is suspected of having the virus, according to Frazzano.

She said the department suspended its fingerprinting services as well.

""The county has canceled theirs already and we were starting to receive the influx from the county,"" Frazzano said.

Chief Mike Murphy of Marco Island Fire-Rescue said the department has canceled an upcoming CPR class for similar reasons.

Murphy said the department canceled the class as a precaution to avoid the spread of the virus.

Murphy said first responders are following standard procedures like they do in cases where a patient might have the flu.

""With flu cases there is a standardized SOP that tells us to put a mask on the patient, wear a mask yourself, and we also keep away non-essential personnel on those types of calls,"" Murphy said. ""One person will go in when it's a flu case or anything like that and evaluate the patient to make a determination of what needs to be done.""

""This is what we do everyday.""

""We are encouraging everyone to follow the guidelines that has been put out by the CDC which include limiting your social interactions as much as possible, only go where you really need to go,"" McNees said on March 12.

McNees said staff continues to monitor the situation closely and evaluate city operations. In the future, the city might consider options like having staff working from home, he said.

McNees said the most important thing he wants to emphasize is that Marco Islanders need to follow the advice of the CDC and Florida Department of Health.

""If you are an elderly resident of the island who has a known compromised immune system, you certainly need to evaluate for yourself, whether the city is closing events or not or whether the city hall is open or closed, you need to evaluate for yourself what you think your risk might be,"" McNees said.

""That's something where people need to take individual responsibility.""

RELATED: CORONAVIRUS BY COUNTY/CITY: Cases jump to 2,900, infant diagnosed in Santa Rosa

But the declaration did not come without controversy, with the council debating for nearly two hours to what extent they were allowed to impose restrictions on citizens to protect public health.

The state of emergency that ultimately passed does several things, including:

— Closing City Hall and encouraging all transactions to take place via the drive-thru window, and removing online payment fees to encourage online payments

— Giving law enforcement officers authority to break up groups of more than 10 people that gather in public places

— Strongly encouraging citizens to reduce movements to essential travel to provide food and care for loved ones, to obtain necessary items for the care and maintenance of the home or business, or for other necessary supplies

The declaration does not close public parks, does not impose a curfew and does not enforce a shelter-in-place order, though it does encourage citizens to restrict their movements to only necessary trips.

The local state of emergency allows the city to apply for state and federal financial aid to help recoup losses caused by the pandemic.

The vote came only a couple of hours after the Department of Health revealed that a 2-year-old Santa Rosa boy is one of four county residents to be confirmed positive for the coronavirus. In Escambia County, there were 10 confirmed cases, as of Tuesday morning.

Councilwoman Shannon Rice had several objections to the declaration, including words in the document directing citizens to ""comply"" and ""obey"" with necessary emergency orders.

Rice was also worried about a line that allowed ""all emergency authority for protection of the lives and property of the people of this city and continuity of government with a minimum of interruption,"" saying it would turn the city into a ""police state"" — something Police Chief Tony Tindell adamantly denied would happen.

""We’re not going to violate people’s rights,"" Tindell said, addressing the council. ""We’re here to serve and to protect, and that’s simply what we’re going to do.""

Tindell added that two of his officers were having to self-quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.

City of Milton attorney Eric Meade, who attended the meeting remotely via telephone, said words like ""comply,"" ""direct"" and ""obey"" were appropriate in the extraordinary circumstances.

""I would tend to agree in every other setting, but every citizen’s liberty is dependent upon not inflicting injury or harm upon any other citizen, and in this situation that has particular force,"" Meade said. ""Because it is precisely the gathering into groups of greater than (10 or more people) that constitutes a clear and present danger under these circumstances, where we have a contagion that is making its way through the population.""

Mayor Heather Lindsay said she believed certain words were necessary in the declaration to relay the correct tone during a time of crisis.

""I can’t help but think back to when I’m with my children and they were very young, and they don’t know all that could make them unsafe, and you are very direct with your child and you may be harsh even with your child if you think your child is unsafe and your child doesn’t know that,"" Lindsay said. ""It’s not our role to treat our citizens as children, but it is an analogy to correlate that when you’re in a state of emergency, there’s a different tone than when there’s not a state of emergency.""

Rice maintained her opposition to the declaration, and was the only council member who voted to oppose it. Councilwoman Peggi Smith was not in attendance.

""This is not the time to infringe on our citizens’ rights. People have died to defend these rights,"" Rice said. ""It’s not the time to hand over our city to the city manager, the police chief and the fire chief. We should stay involved, and that’s what I feel that this is doing. This is handing this city over to non-elected officials, and that is not what our citizens want.""

The state of emergency lasts through April 30.

The city of Naples declared a local state of emergency Monday due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus and has set up a COVID-19 hotline.

The emergency declaration gives the city the administrative powers to buy supplies and make decisions in the wake of an emergency.

City residents can call the city's COVID-19 hotline at 239-213-4902, Naples Fire Rescue Chief Pete DiMaria said.

The announcement comes a day before the Naples election where city residents will elect the mayor and three city councilors for the next four years.

“It is important to note, the city encourages residents to vote,” Mayor Bill Barnett said.

Jennifer Edwards, the Collier County Supervisor of Elections, said staffing will be reduced at polling locations, but asked for patience from city residents. More than 80 election workers have excused themselves from working Tuesday, Edwards said.

“There may be some lines. Please be patient with us,” Edwards said. “It’s a short ballot, so processing of the voters will move along very quickly.”

More than 59 polling locations will be open across the county on Tuesday, Edwards said.

Businesses, parks and city workers

Naples is not taking steps to close businesses or restaurants, Barnett said. The ability to close those establishments is not within the city’s purview, city manager Charles Chapman said.

“We are not contemplating shutting down any private business or any private restaurant or food court operation at this point in time,” Chapman said. “We are taking into consideration public safety as it related to our public facilities and we are reviewing the CDC guidelines.”

All permitted weddings and picnic shelter rentals at City facilities are cancelled.

Naples is making adjustments to allow city staff to work from home. The city has canceled all business-related travel for city employees outside of Collier County until May 1, 2020, Barnett said.

Any non-essential city meetings will be postponed until the end of March, Barnett said.

Public meetings of the city’s Design Review Board, Planning Advisory Board and code enforcement board will continue as scheduled.

No cancellations or changes have been made to City Council meetings as of Monday, Barnett said.

Mayor Bill Barnett and the City of Naples declared a state of emergency during a press conference Monday in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).

City administration is working with partner agencies and adjusting operations to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the city’s emergency response team is working to provide resources for the community. This involves taking steps with Florida Department of Health to prioritize testing for as many people as possible, improving access to testing.

With the state of emergency declared, city employees will be able to work from home. For people who cannot work from home, the city will be sanitizing work spaces.

Business-related travel for employees is canceled until May, and public meetings and advisory meetings will be postponed.

Amid the state of emergency, people we spoke to seem to be going about their daily lives but with extra precautions.

“We were conscience in church,” visitor William McNamara said. “I think a little more distance between other folks.”

Locals such as Russ Abraham says he is also following the steps for health safety.

“Washing your hands a lot, trying to figure out what we’re going to do with the rest of our lives,” said Abraham, who has lived in Naples for 20 years.

The city is not currently making any orders to close businesses or restaurant but expect them to abide by current guidelines.

“This pandemic will undoubtedly have an impact on our local businesses and nonprofit organization,” Barnett said.

It’s a move that has visitors and locals split.

“We’ve been trying to eat out doors and enjoying that,” McNamara said.

“Those are gathering places for people,” Abraham said.”You know take out service would probably do just as well.”

CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS

There are six positive COVID-19 cases in Collier County, one of those a confirmed NCH Healthcare System patient.

NCH tested 40 people for coronavirus at it mobile collection site Monday and says it’s prepared for more cases.

“NCH has planned well for the supplies and resources necessary to protect our staff and our patients,” said Paul Hiltz, the NCH CEO and president.

TUESDAY ELECTION ON SCHEDULE

The city is still encouraging residents to vote Tuesday during the primary. Jennifer Edward, Collier County supervisor of elections, spoke during the press conference. She also said there will still be an election. Hand sanitizer and wipes have been purchased for all 59 polling locations.

However, two assisted living facilities have withdrawn from being polling locations and have been change to new ones. And over 80 election workers have excused themselves from coming to work, so locations are understaffed. Officials warn to expect lines.

There is no exact time frame for how long the state of emergency will last in Naples. A consideration for closing beaches and parks is under review and has not been decided.

NORTH PORT — The North Port City Commission declared a state of emergency Tuesday because of the coronavirus.

The ordinance adopted takes effect for seven days and can be renewed while the emergency persists.

""This Is one of those extremely fluid situations,"" North Port City Manager Peter Lear said Tuesday. ""The situation is changing — I want to say daily but it’s changing faster than that.""

The order itself does not impact private businesses but it does open up the possibility of the city receiving reimbursement from the federal government for any expenses related to the coronavirus.

Commissioners also considered the possibility of both taking public comment electronically and holding virtual meetings. When the five-member board, plus charter officers and the police chief are considered, those officials alone constitute the 10-person limit suggested by Gov. Ron DeSantis.

As part of a second unanimous vote, it canceled in-person meetings for all city advisory boards but left open the option for the planning and zoning advisory board and board of zoning appeals to meet virtually or by teleconference.

Also in that second motion was an authorization to suspend utility fees and fees associated with additional bulk waste pickup and authorization for city staff to work with nonprofits ranging from the United Way of South Sarasota County to area churches and other volunteer groups to publicize any relief efforts they may undertake during the self-quarantine period on the city website and Facebook page.

The city also opened up the option of working with the school board or other groups, to open up city facilities for expanded meal distribution, aimed primarily at keeping schoolchildren fed while schools are closed.

Monday, the city closed the North Port Aquatic Center, Warm Mineral Springs, the Canine Club dog Park and the Scout House at Dallas White Park through the month of April.

The Morgan Family Community Center and George Mullen Activity Center remained open for drop-ins.

Drop-in are people who use the centers for unstructured/unscheduled activities such as basketball, pickleball, table tennis, and volleyball.

That was when the CDC recommended limiting large gatherings of 50 or fewer people.

Lear said that after a 2 p.m. conference call with the Sarasota County EOC, he would be able to determine what the new recommendation to reduce gatherings to 10 people or fewer would mean for those two facilities.

Currently the commission plans to meet as scheduled on March 24.

Public comment may occur electronically. That process is still being worked out, but Lear noted it could be as simple as an email that he would then read into the record.

""We’re looking at the possibility of electronic meetings where we would not even have to assemble to have a meeting,"" Lear said.

City Attorney Amber Slayton noted that quarantine issues in the future may make it impossible to have a physical quorum.

With that in mind, the city may enact ordinances that would allow for a virtual meeting, in addition to electronic public comment.

Authorities imposed new restrictions on movement and travel Saturday as the spread of confirmed coronavirus cases accelerated in Palm Beach County and deaths linked to the pandemic spiked across Florida.

Delray Beach and Palm Beach on Saturday became the county’s second and third cities to issue stay-at-home orders, joining Boca Raton, and the first to add curfews.

Delray Beach’s order, which takes effect Monday, includes a curfew restricting residents to the premises of their residences each night from midnight to 6 a.m. Palm Beach’s curfew extends from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

The moves came as Palm Beach County’s confirmed cases rose to 318 Saturday, a 32 percent single-day jump and more than double the total on Wednesday, state officials said.

The number of deaths in the county rose to six, up from five Friday, and jumped statewide to 56 – an increase of 10 from the previous day.

>> Palm Beach County is last in Florida in testing per capita

The county’s sixth victim was a 90-year-old woman, state records show. The dead also include a 63-year-old intensive care nurse at Miami’s Jackson Memorial Hospital, The Miami Herald reported.

As more cities urged residents to stay at home, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for coronavirus checkpoints on the state’s highways, saying travelers arriving from Louisiana and New York on major interstates would be directed to self-quarantine for two weeks.

""I think it’s in everybody’s interest that we deal with the spread that we have here now, try to blunt it, flatten the curve but we don’t allow importing new infections like we may be,"" he said at a news conference Saturday.

The checkpoints would be in place on southbound Interstate 95 and eastbound Interstate 10 and are in addition to checkpoints in place at the state’s major airports, he said.

>>Sales boom at this Riviera Beach air purifier factory — so do jobs

Underscoring the increasing concerns, the state surgeon general sent a public safety alert to Floridians’ cellphones Saturday afternoon urging anyone 65 or older or with medical conditions to stay at home. DeSantis said those messages will continue.

Statewide, 4,038 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, a 26 percent one-day increase, the figures released Saturday night show.

Palm Beach County’s cases increased Saturday more briskly than Florida’s overall, but numbers for both are rising at a faster pace than just a few days ago. The number of cases both statewide and in Palm Beach County are now on pace to double in less than three days.

While confirmed cases continue to rise, DeSantis’ decision Friday to open a drive-thru testing center in the county is sure to yield an even greater number of cases.

>>PBC firefighters poised to loan ambulance ventilators to hospitals

Plans are underway to open the center at the FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach but no activity took place there Saturday. State officials did not respond to questions about the plans.

Those infected in Palm Beach County range in age from 6 to 92. More women are being diagnosed in Palm Beach County, with men dropping to 53 percent of the cases from 68 percent a few days ago.

>>Expectant moms face different world, new rules

With the pace of contamination quickening, state and local officials are going to greater lengths to control the spread.

Saturday morning, the town of Palm Beach became the county’s second city to issue a ""shelter-in-place"" order. Palm Beach has had recorded one death and six other positive cases associated with the disease, the health department reported.

The order, announced shortly before noon, says that Palm Beach residents ""are urged"" to shelter in place but stops short of requiring people remain in their homes.

>>Post staffers, veterans of past disasters, don’t blink in the eye of the coronavirus pandemic

It says residents are free to leave their homes to shop, go to work, visit family, worship or exercise. The town’s curfew was put in place before Saturday’s stay-at-home directive.

Later in the day, Delray Beach announced its own stay-at-home order and a curfew, both to take effect Monday at midnight.

Delray Beach City Commissioner Adam Frankel called the curfew ""reasonable,"" saying the city had begun to draw people from Broward and Miami-Dade counties where stay-at-home orders are in place countywide.

""We are trying to strike a balance between keeping people safe while allowing our businesses to operate somewhat in what if not impossible than very difficult time,"" he said.

>>Readers tell us how they are coping day to day

The only other Palm Beach County city to issue a shelter-in-place order is Boca Raton. County officials have declined to go that far and Sheriff Ric Bradshaw has opposed a countywide curfew.

DeSantis announced the interstate checkpoints at a news conference Saturday where he also said the state had arranged to buy doses of hydroxychloroquine from an Israeli pharmaceutical company.

Hydroxychloroquine is a malaria drug that has shown some early signs of helping in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but health authorities say its benefits are unproven.

>>Locals are sewing masks for nurses and doctors. Do they help? It’s complicated

A Miami Herald reporter was denied access to DeSantis’ news conference, a move that the Herald reporter attributed to a request by the Herald and six other newspapers, including The Palm Beach Post, for the governor to conduct news conferences through a digital video conference application or in a larger room.

Doing so, the newspapers argued, would allow journalists to maintain ""social distance"" and still ask questions. The state suggested the reporter would be safer by skipping the news conference entirely.

The governor’s office did not announce the timing of the news conference in advance and reporters who are not present cannot ask questions.

DeSantis issued an executive order Friday night that orders travelers to Florida from ""an area with substantial community spread"" to ""self-declare"" and go into a 14-day quarantine.

The governor also expanded an earlier order directed at flights from New York City to include travelers from Louisiana, which has become a COVID-19 hotspot that researchers linked to the annual Mardi Gras celebration in February.

In addition to the checkpoints set up this week for flights from New York to South Florida, DeSantis plans to have state troopers and sheriff’s deputies screen cars for visitors from areas where there has been substantial community spread of the disease.

Signs were erected along I-10 to direct eastbound drivers to a checkpoint where they were notified about the requirement. DeSantis said he planned to establish one on I-95 to catch New York travelers.

""Having the 10 and 95 (checkpoints) is good and I think that provides the protection,"" DeSantis said when asked about other routes into the state.

Currently, National Guard members greet visitors from the greater New York City area at airports in South Florida. Officials say the Guard had collected 3,406 enforcement forms from New York travelers in the past week.

South Florida remains the epicenter

South Florida remained the epicenter of the pandemic in Florida, with Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties accounting for more than 2,200 cases, more than half the state’s total.

Miami-Dade cases surpassed 1,000 for the first time, rising to 1,121; while Broward County rose to 820 from 631 a day earlier.

To Palm Beach County’s north, Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties account for 64 cases, up from 49 Friday night.

At 22 confirmed cases per 100,000 residents, Palm Beach County has a lower rate than Broward, at 43, or Miami-Dade, at 40.

The health department said 37 patients are hospitalized with the disease in Palm Beach County.

Nearly half of Palm Beach County’s 292 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning were in south county, with the Boca Raton area accounting for 54, Boynton Beach 41 and Delray Beach 40.

The list of retirement communities infected with the virus west of Delray Beach and Boynton Beach continues to grow.

The Valencia Palms Homeowners Association has notified its residents that the community has one confirmed case and two other residents awaiting test results

All three are recovering and have placed themselves into quarantine, said Bob Kamen, president of the homeowners association. He added that none of the three had done any traveling outside of South Florida.

The communities of Palm Isles, Coral Lakes, Valencia Falls and Majestic Isles have previously reported coronavirus cases, as has Hunters Run Country Club in Boynton Beach.

While Florida cases continue to rise, at least five states have more cases: New York, New Jersey, California, Michigan and Massachusetts.

U.S. cases topped 121,000, with more than 2,000 deaths. Worldwide, the death toll surpassed 30,000.

Globally, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases climbed close to 659,000.

2 Sri Lankan villages sealed off after positive coronavirus tests

Mnuchin says decision to reopen business will be health decision not economic

Fauci warns U.S. will have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths

More than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.

As the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.

The U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.

Fauci was speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union” as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.

Fauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged “it’s a little iffy there” right now.

With Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.

The White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.

The addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.

Sri Lanka seals off two villages

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.

The villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.

More than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.

Health before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.

Mnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.

But he says President Donald Trump’s top objective is the health of the American public.

Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.

He said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.

He said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.

Louisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed

WASHINGTON — Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state’s health care system.

Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week” that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.

He said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.

He made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.

Muscovites told to stay home

MOSCOW — The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.

A video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch’s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.

Non-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.

14-year-old boy dies in Portugal

LISBON, Portugal — The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.

Minister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.

Portugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.

Pelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn’t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The top Democrat in Congress says the government should be “taking every precaution” and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.

Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump’s “denial” early in the crisis was “deadly.”

She says: “As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.”

Pelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: “What did he know and when did he know it?”

Panama to allow cruise ships to use canal

PANAMA CITY — Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn’t immediately clear.

Holland America Line said via a Facebook post, “We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew” and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.

The Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.

Holland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.

Panamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.

50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations

MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.

Many of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

Sanibel's city council met in a special session Wednesday and unanimously approved a resolution proclaiming a local state of emergency for the city because of the coronavirus outbreak.

Additionally, the council approved placement of 250 signs at all island beach access points that highlight social distancing and crowd numbers suggestions.

The vote was 5-0 with Mayor Kevin Ruane, Vice Mayor Mick Denham and council members Richard Johnson, Jason Maughan and Holly Smith voting.

The official resolution is an emergency measure deemed necessary for the protection of the public health, welfare and safety, due to the serious threat of COVID-19, an explanation of the action said.

""This just allows us to be part of any procurement and reimbursement,"" connected to the COVID-19 issue, Ruane said.

During the meeting, closed to actual public visitation but open to citizen questions via email, about 25 such queries had to be read into the record, Ruane said.

He said people made all sorts of suggestions, closing the beaches, keeping the beaches open, closing restaurants.

""People suggested closing the causeway,"" he said. ""We don't have the authority for that.""

The emergency measure will roll over every seven days as needed, he said, because law limits such a measure to that time frame.

Ruane also said the 250, plastic-coated signs, which were just manufactured, would be placed at beach access points to remind those using the areas about keeping a defined space between them and others and limiting the numbers in their groups.

""It will say the things the governor asked us to do,"" he said.

VENICE — The city of Venice officially declared a state of emergency over coronavirus Monday morning, as city officials have canceled upcoming advisory board meetings and a planned Wednesday joint meeting between the Venice City Council and the Venice Planning Commission that would have been hosted in the county-run Venice Community Center.

The local state of emergency, which Venice City Manager Ed Lavallee signed into effect at 9 a.m., would remain in effect for seven days.

See our complete coverage of the coronavirus outbreak

The order itself does not impact private businesses, but it does open up the possibility of the city receiving reimbursement from the federal government for any expenses related to the coronavirus.

On March 12, Lavallee canceled permits for all special events held on city-owned property. As part of that, the Saturday farmers market, hosted at Venice City Hall, was canceled through the month of April.

Before Sarasota County’s decision on Sunday to close the Venice Community Center, the city had planned to have emergency medical personnel conduct screenings of anyone who planned to attend the joint council-planning commission meeting.

That process would also have been in place Tuesday, when the planning commission had been scheduled to meet.

Venice Fire Chief Shawn Carvey said those screenings would, at the very least include a series of questions and possibly a temperature or visual wellness check, pending CDC guidelines.

""We’re going to go through a list of questions, like if they walked into a hospital,"" Carvey said. ""Have they traveled, have they been around anybody that’s traveled — those types of things, to eliminate any high-risk type person.

""If they answered yes to those questions, they were going to be turned away from the meeting.""

Carvey was waiting for an update during the afternoon conference call with the Sarasota County EOC, to make sure all agencies are on the same page.

In addition to canceling advisory board meetings, city officials are also reviewing the agenda for the March 24 city council meeting, and weighing whether or not to cancel that meeting as well.

""They’re trying to make sure there’s nothing that is time sensitive, and if there’s nothing that becomes time sensitive, there’s no reason to do any type of meeting,"" Carvey said.

Tuesday’s planning commission meeting potentially had one time-sensitive item — a temporary-use permit to allow the city to relocate Fire Station 51 from the city hall campus to 925 S. Tamiami Trail, while a new station is constructed as part of the overall city hall campus renovation.

Carvey said he had planned to ask for the decision to be moved to the April 7 meeting anyway, since negotiations are still under way with the property owners.

Meanwhile, the decision to pull all city event permits also means postponement of the 28th annual Venice Shark’s Tooth Festival, as well as the 18th annual Venice Shark’s Tooth Fishing Tournament for Special Olympics Athletes, which had been set for April 2.

Venice Marine Patrol Officer Paul Joyce said discussions are ongoing as to whether the tournament can be hosted later this year or if it will be postponed until next April.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

Trump floats 2-week quarantine of NYC, Gov. Cuomo calls it ‘federal declaration of war’

WASHINGTON —President Donald Trump said Saturday that he may order an “enforceable quarantine” for New York City and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut —prompting surprise and shock from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

“This would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I’d rather not do it, but we may need it,” Trump said.

Cuomo likened such a quarantine to a “federal declaration of war” on the city and state. “It would be chaos and mayhem. … I don’t think it is plausible. I don’t think it is legal,” he said hours later on CNN.

Such an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. In China, a two-month lockdown in Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, began easing only on Saturday.

New York has roughly half of the nation’s confirmed cases.

“We’re looking at it and will be making a decision. A lot of the states that are infected — they’ve asked me if I’d look at it so we’re going to look at it,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a short flight to Norfolk, Va., for a visit to a Navy hospital ship headed to New York. “It would be for a short time.”

Cuomo’s immediate reaction: No thanks.

“I don’t like the sound of it,” he told reporters in Albany. “I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don’t know what you would be accomplishing.

France orders a billion protective masks

PARIS — France has ordered more than one billion protective masks, mainly from China, to try to make up for a shortage that is being felt in nations fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced.

But French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, noting tensions in world markets, suggested at a news conference that traffickers and black marketeers are now in the mask business, given the competition in procuring the vital necessity for health workers.

Veran said that an “air bridge” to China was being put in place, but “I will have the certitude (the masks arrived) … only the minute the planes are on the tarmac.” He said one major difficulty is that countries already hit by the virus remain vigilant that should the epidemic return they are equipped.

As of Saturday, France had 37,575 confirmed cases and 2,314 deaths — with 319 new deaths in the last 24 hours, health authorities said.

The prime minister warned the French that “the fight has just begun.”

Infant dies of COVID-19

CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death.

Officials didn’t release other information about the infant, who was from Cook County, which includes Chicago, including whether the child had other health issues.

The risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.

Children have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized.

Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill.

Italy: COVID-19 crisis an “appointment with history”

ROME — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is hoping the European Union will put together a cohesive response to the plight of countries like his, whose economy has been crippled by the coronavirus outbreak.

Conte vowed to fight “to my very last drop of sweat” to prompt a “strong and cohesive European response.” Conte echoed an appeal the same evening by Spain, which is also reeling under a devastating COVID-19 outbreak.

Conte called the crisis “an appointment with history. Europe must say if it’s ready for this appointment” to effectively deal with social and economic shock wreaked by the pandemic.

Germany and the Netherlands are leading other EU nations in resisting calls for an issuance of joint European debt, colloquially dubbed “coronabonds.” Italian Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri expressed dismay that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in an interview described the bond idea as a “only a slogan.”

Crisis may delay Polish elections

WARSAW, Poland — Poland President Andrzej Duda says the May 10 date for the presidential election may not be realistic if the coronavirus spread continues and Poland remains under the current strict isolation regime for the citizens.

Duda’s words were the first sign from the ruling team that the elections may not be held as planned.

Earlier Saturday, the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party had the parliament approve changes to the electoral law to allow sick, quarantined and elderly people to vote remotely, in a clear preparation for May election.

Florida governor supports NYC quarantine

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump, tells reporters he had spoken with the president about the possibility of a coronavirus quarantine for the New York City area.

DeSantis says Florida will soon set up a checkpoint along Interstate 95 to screen travellers from that area, similar to one already in place along Interstate 10 to screen people from Louisiana. Many airports in Florida also are screening travellers from certain areas, requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days.

“I think whatever works is what we need to do,” DeSantis said. “We’re either fighting the virus or we’re not. The more people are being shuttled around the country, I just think it makes it more difficult. I think it would make it a lot easier if we didn’t have folks coming in from hot zones.”

Some South Carolina cities defy governor’s opposition to stay-at-home orders

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Leaders of several South Carolina cities say they are defying Gov. Henry McMaster’s opposition to stay-at-home orders and Attorney General Alan Wilson’s opinion that only McMaster can issue such measures.

In Folly Beach, where town officials had removed their checkpoint and had allowed vacation rentals to resume, the city council unanimously voted to re-establish the checkpoint and ban any new short-term rentals beginning Sunday.

Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin says on Twitter that his city’s stay-at-home order would take effect at 12:01 a.m. Sunday as scheduled. He says Wilson’s Friday opinion is “incorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis.”

Italy frees up $400 million euros for food coupons and food aid

ROME — Three weeks into national containment measures that have shut down most shops and non-essential industry, many Italians are hurting for food money during the lockdown amid the country’s devastating COVID-19 outbreak.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte told the nation he has signed a decree freeing up 400 million euros ($440 million) for food coupons and packages of food aid. Volunteers from Italy’s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.

Conte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: “People are suffering psychologically, they’re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.”

Conte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.

Germany: 12 die in nursing home

BERLIN — Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.

Authorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn’t shown symptoms of COVID-19.

Local officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.

Another nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.

Germany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.

First coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.

One person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.

There are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.

The Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.

Spain: Future of the EU is at stake

MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc’s southern flank.

“It’s Europe’s time to act. Europe is at risk,” Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.

Sanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.

He calls for a “new Marshall Plan” to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.

Italy and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.

Spain: Commuting ban starts Monday

MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.

Sanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home “as if it were a weekend” to “intensify” efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Spain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.

Spain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.

New Orleans one of U.S.’s COVID-19 hot spots

NEW ORLEANS — New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.

The donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.

“Like many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,” New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.

New Orleans is one of the nation’s hot spots for coronavirus.

Italy’s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day

ROME — Italy’s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.

Civil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a one-day high in the country which has the world’s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus.

The day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day’s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of COVID-19 and days ago surpassed the total of China, where the outbreak began in early 2020.

The current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.

U.N. donates protective masks to NYC

UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the donation of 250,000 protective face masks, which had just been located in United Nations storage facilities, to the United States for use in hard-hit New York City.

The U.N. chief says: “These masks, in surplus to United Nations requirements, will be given to the medical professionals in New York City who have been working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives.”

Guterres says the United Nations and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office to ensure swift delivery of the masks to medical facilities around the city.

“On behalf of the U.N. community and the diplomatic corps, we sincerely hope this modest donation makes a difference,” Guterres said.

Illnesses in Detroit, a national hot spot for COVID-19, predicted to worsen next week

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to help the state address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The declaration announced by the White House on Saturday follows a back-and-forth between Trump and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has criticized the Trump administration for its slow response to the pandemic, saying “we cannot weather this alone.”

The U.S. surgeon general said Friday that Detroit, a national “hot spot” for cases of the new coronavirus, will worsen next week. More than 3,600 people in Michigan were confirmed to have COVID-19 Friday. At least 92 have died, most from the three counties in the Detroit area, according to state officials.

Detroit has recorded 28 deaths and 1,166 cases, according to the city’s health department.",quarantine,678.0,30.6197,-85.7062

WINTER HAVEN — The world continues to get smaller as the city of Winter Haven on Wednesday night joined a global list of cities, states and countries declaring a state of emergency to deal with the COVID-19 crisis.

The City Commission unanimously declared a local emergency in Winter Haven and ratified City Manager Mike Herr's decision to shut down most indoor facilities for 60 days beginning Thursday. The vote came during an emergency commission meeting called earlier in the day.

The city has also canceled meetings for most advisory and special committees for the next two months with the exception of the city and planning commissions and a few other bodies.

The city and planning commissions will be moved out of City Hall to Nora Mayo Hall to accommodate social distancing between city officials and the public attending the meetings. Wednesday's meeting was held at Nora Mayo, where commissioners and staff were seated at least six feet apart as were chairs for the public.

The list of facilities closed includes the AdventHealth Fieldhouse and Conference Center, including the neighboring Rowdy Gaines Olympic Pool; the Senior Adult Center; the Winter Haven Recreation and Cultural Center; the Tennis Center, including the aquatic splash pad playground; and the public library. All parks and trails will remain open but park buildings will be closed.

The closures are consistent with state and federal government advisories to limit gatherings to 10 people or less, Herr said.

Not determined yet is whether the municipal Willowbrook Golf Course will remain open, although the clubhouse will likely close.

Officials had not yet consulted executives with Billy Casper Golf, the private company managing the course under lease with the city, Herr said. It will be addressed at Monday's regular commission meeting.

Mayor Brad Dantzler pushed back at closing the golf course and tennis center. He argued both sports by their nature are played in small groups and that residents need some exercise place to deal with tensions during the COVID-19 crisis.

“To me, this is overreach,” Dantzler said. “Somehow our citizens have to have some release at this time.”

Travis Edwards, director of the parks, recreation and culture department, said the decision to close the tennis courts was made in anticipation it would attract large crowds because of the closure of all the other municipal recreation facilities.

“If you're not a tennis player, and all of the sudden the tennis center is the only thing open, you're not going to run out and play tennis,” Dantzler said.

The mayor conceded when no other commissioners appeared to support him.

“I personally feel we need to act in the most conservative way we can because we don't know about this virus,” Mayor Pro Tem Nat Birdsong said. “I've heard so many times it's better to overreach than underreach.”

The city will not lay off any of its 504 full- or part-time employees as a result of the closures, Herr said.

“For a 60-day period, there's going to be plenty of work to keep people busy,” he said.

The city manager is exploring having some municipal employees work from home or other remote site, Herr said. Top managers are compiling a list of workers who might be able to do that.

Herr acknowledged, however, nobody knows whether the 60-day period will need to be extended as the nation struggles to control spread of the coronavirus.

In addition to the city and planning commissions, the police, fire and general pension boards will continue meeting because they may have to take action in light of the COVID-19 crisis, Herr said. They will also meet at Nora Mayo.

The city will also suspend any disconnections of water and sewer services for the next 60 days.

The emergency declaration allows the city manager to waive a number of restrictions on actions he can take, City Attorney John Murphy said.

That includes purchasing, including the requirement to seek competitive bids for goods and services worth more than $30,000; closing facilities; and taking some workforce actions, he said. The state of emergency will last for 60 days.

Previous story: A mobile unit is being set up at Northeast Georgia Medical Center in Gainesville to assist in the response to COVID-19 in our community and local hospital officials are urging people to stay home.

The unit, which the hospital received from the Georgia Department of Public Health, will provide for about 15 to 30 treatment spaces, according to Northeast Georgia Health System director of public relations Sean Couch. There is not yet a timeline for when it will be in operation nor information about exactly how it will be used.

Hall County as of noon Tuesday had just one case of COVID-19. Numbers coming from DPH are tallied by residence of the patient. The health system is currently treating two patients at its Braselton location.

Dr. Shravan Kethireddy, NGMC medical director of critical care, said the spread of infectious diseases is measured by the doubling rates of the disease, which show the effectiveness of quarantining measures.

Canton,GA,03-23-2020 10:47,https://patch.com/georgia/canton-ga/coronavirus-canton-adopts-emergency-ordinance,Coronavirus: Canton Adopts Emergency Ordinance,"CANTON, GA — The City of Canton is working to provide our community updates on the spread of coronavirus. Recently, Mayor Bill Grant and the city council followed suit with a local emergency ordinance under the current state and federal declarations.

""It is imperative that our citizens and businesses get behind local efforts to flatten the curve and decrease the spread of this virus,"" the city said in a press release. ""We need your help.""

On Thursday, March 19, the mayor and council held its regularly scheduled meeting. The city council adopted an emergency ordinance which allows the mayor and council to meet via conference call during the next 90 days to conduct business of the city. It also allows the mayor and/or city manager to adopt policies and regulations related to city personnel, limit public access to meetings to livestream only, and to restrict access to the public to city facilities. Additionally, the mayor and council cancelled all public meetings for the month of April, except for special called emergency meetings that may arise from local concerns.

The City of Canton facilities will remain closed to the public through April 13. This includes City Hall, Public Safety & Municipal Court Complex, Public Works Facility, and the Canton Theatre.

The city is encouraging individuals to do business with the City of Canton via Cantonga.gov, by calling 770-704-1500 for non-utility concerns, calling 770-704-1502 for all utility concerns, and emailing at TellUs@cantonga.gov. Additionally, the city is moving to a minimal on-site staffing level until April 10 to allow employees to telework from home, work remotely from city fleet, and to provide back up redundancy to critical city operations. Additional information about city operations can be found in this memo from the city manager.

On Friday, March 20, Grant issued an Executive Order allowing restaurants to provide package sales of beer and wine with to-go orders. The hope is that this measure will cut down on the number of individuals dining out inside restaurants and encourage take out orders, while providing support to local restaurants.

Cherokee County recently announced the temporary suspension of county ordinances related to the sale of unopened/uncorked bottles of beer and wine by licensees holding a ""consumption on the premises"" license in conjunction with to-go food orders. Licensees who hold a ""consumption on the premises"" license shall be allowed to sell unopened/uncorked bottles of beer and/or wine in package form with to-go food orders.

This temporary suspension will remain in effect through April 30, or until reinstated by the Board of Commissioners, whichever occurs first.

Additionally, the city is waiving penalties and late fees for utility bills, is suspending disconnects on utility accounts through April 30, and is allowing for small business hardship claims to be sent by email for extensions on business occupational license renewals and other monthly/quarterly business filings.



The city gave other tips for businesses, faith based leaders and citizens, including:

What can your business do?

One of the best ways to slow the spread of COVID19 is to limit public contact. While the City of Canton is not currently looking to restrict business operations, we believe it is in the best interest of the community that local businesses follow the CDC Guidelines for Businesses & Employers as well as follow the 15 Day Guidelines published by the White House to stop the spread of COVID19. These guidelines encourage citizens to avoid social gatherings of 10 or more and avoid dining in at restaurants and bars. We hope that our business community will take these guidelines as a recommendation for best business practices from the City during these challenging times. Encourage occupational limits in your facilities. Encourage to-go, delivery, and curbside services. Encourage online shopping. Please work with us to discourage large gatherings.

Your business can make a big difference in the slowing of coronavirus. If you are making any operational adjustments and want us to help get out the word, please email us.

What can our faith based community do?

We highly encourage our local churches to utilize online platforms for services. We have seen in neighboring communities the impacts of worship gatherings and the spread of COVID19. Please follow the guidelines for small gatherings. Additionally, we need our local faith based community to help provide daily social assistance to our vulnerable populations. Please call and check on your members, especially seniors and those with severe health conditions.

What can our citizens do?

There are many ways that every person in Canton can participate in slowing this pandemic. First and foremost, stay home if you are sick! The CDC and Department of Public Health urge citizens that exhibit symptoms of coronavirus (dry cough, fever, shortness of breath) to call a local health provider, emergency room, or public health before going to those facilities. The Georgia COVID Hotline is 1-844-442-2681.

For our public that is not sick, we encourage you to practice social distancing. This means sheltering in place, limiting public contact by being considerate of distances in local grocery stores, keeping your hands clean after coming in contact with high-touch areas such as fuel pumps, ATMs, and door handles. Reach out to local restaurants and utilize to-go, carryout, and delivery services. Please do not dine in restaurants and limit your gatherings to 10 people or fewer if you must gather. You may utilize City parks and trails for exercise, but again we stress social distancing. Please discourage your children from using playgrounds as these can only be cleaned so often and are difficult to completely close down given their integration with our parks.

Lastly, our citizens can look out for each other. Now is a great time to clean out closets and consider future contributions to organizations like MUST Ministries, Cherokee Family Violence Center, Salvation Army, and Goodwill. There are so many others. Consider a donation to these and other non-profit organizations that are currently providing assistance for laid off workers, emergency housing, meal and bill assistance programs, and general social services. Consider providing assistance to local businesses by buying a gift card, shopping online, or just calling to say hello.

The City of Cleveland declared a state of emergency and approved emergency measures to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 during a called meeting on Thursday, March 26.

The state of emergency will take effect today, Thursday, March 26, and will expire on April 16, unless the council decides to extend it or terminate it earlier.

The City of Helen made its own emergency declaration on Tuesday, March 24, and the White County Board of Commissioners approved an emergency declaration for the unincorporated areas of White County earlier on Thursday.

Highlights of the ordinance include:

• For the duration of the declared emergency, there shall be no public gatherings on any property owned or controlled by the City. To avoid confusion, the following definitions shall apply under this Section: a ""public gathering"" shall mean the organized gathering or assembly of ten (10) or more persons at a specific location; ""property owned or controlled by the City"" shall include any park, public square, public space, playground, recreational area, or similar place of public gathering, but nothing herein shall prohibit individuals or families from using sidewalks or designated pedestrian areas of parks for walking or other exercise if they are not participating in an organized gathering.

• Restaurants and other eating and dining establishments where food is served must cease offering dine-in services but may continue preparing and offering food to customers via delivery, drive- through or take-out services. Patrons, employees and contractors of the establishments must maintain at least six (6) feet of personal distance between themselves. Restaurants, licensed by the City of Cleveland to sell/serve beer, wine, mixed drinks, or alcohol in any form, for on-premises consumption, shall not be authorized to sell any opened or unopened bottles or cans of beer or wine or mixed drinks or alcohol in any form, for take-out consumption off-premises

• All businesses which remain open during the emergency must post signage on entrance doors informing consumers to maintain at least six (6) feet of personal distance between themselves and others and shall not allow morethan ten (10) people into suchestablishment at any one time if such social distancing cannot be maintained.

• All public and private gatherings of more than ten (10) people occurring outside of a household or living unit are prohibited. Nothing in this ordinance, however, prohibits the gathering of individualsfor the purposes ofcarrying on business certified as· ""essential"" by the Georgia Emergency Management Agency pursuant to O.C.G.A. §38-3-58, the provision of medical or health services, or critical infrastructure businesses and employees as designated by the Governor or identified by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity and InfrastructureSecurity Agency (as may be found in the Memorandum on Identification of Essential Critical Infrastructure Workers During COVID-19 Response, or subsequent document).

• Any person violating the provisions of this ordinance shall be deemed guilty of an offense, and upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by the municipal court of the City of Cleveland. Such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during which any violation of this ordinance is committed, continued or permitted by that person and shall be punished up to $1000.00 per day for the violation.

There is no curfew included with the state of emergency.

The action follows Gov. Brian Kemp’s executive orders earlier in the week that required “medically fragile” Georgians and those at high risk of contracting the novel coronavirus to stay at home, closed all bars and nightclubs, and prohibited gatherings of 10 or more unless the participants remain at least 6 feet apart.

Dallas,GA,,https://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/dallas-county-declares-public-health-emergency-following-community-spread-case-of-coronavirus,Dallas County declares public health emergency following community-spread case of coronavirus,"Dallas County has issued a public health emergency disaster declaration after its first case of community-spread COVID-19 coronavirus.

Health officials announced Friday night that Dallas County has an additional five presumptive positive cases of the virus. One of the new cases did not have any travel history, meaning it was spread within Dallas County.

The county has filed for a public health emergency declaration and community gathering order prohibiting gatherings of more than 500 people. The declaration will take effect Friday at 11 a.m. and is scheduled to last one week, at this time. Those who do not follow the ordinance could be cited.

Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins says the ban on public gatherings does not include schools, office towers, theaters, airports or grocery stores as long as more than 500 people are not present at once or within arm’s length of each other.

RELATED: Coronavirus coverage

""It is a very serious situation and one that will be getting a lot worse before it gets better,"" Jenkins said. ""But how we fare as a community will depend on all of us, and not just depending on gathering orders, but to use our brains as we're all very good at doing in this community, and ask yourself the question as you do things, 'Is this worth the risk, not just to me, but to the community?'""

Health officials say groups larger than 250 people are highly discouraged, but they are not prohibited at this time. Those with increased risks, such as 60 years or older or pre-existing conditions, should not gather in groups of 10 or more, officials said.

The new cases involve a woman in her 70s, a man in his 40s, a man in his 50s, a man in his 60s and another woman in her 60s. Two of them are in the hospital while the other three are self-isolating at home. Four of the cases involve Dallas residents while one lives in Balch Springs.

When it comes to how the five people got the virus, health officials said: two are from domestic travel, one from international travel, one is being investigated as ""likely transmission from a close contact"" and one is believed to be the community-spread case.

Mayor Eric Johnson issued a proclamation declaring a local state of disaster late Thursday, similar to the county’s declaration.

The city manager is authorized to restrict gatherings of 500 people or more. The city is also asking that labs report the number of COVID-19 tests done daily.

The proclamation lasts for seven days and would then need to be renewed by the Dallas City Council.

A meeting will be held at the Dallas City Hall at 10 a.m. Friday to discuss how the city and county are preparing.

The late Thursday announcement brings the total cases of the coronavirus in Dallas County up to eight. There are also four cases in Collin County and one case in Tarrant County.

Coronavirus health tips

While COVID-19 is a new respiratory virus, daily precautions recommended to prevent respiratory illnesses are the same:

• Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer when you can't wash your hands.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

• Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue away. If you don’t have a tissue, use the elbow of your sleeve. Don’t use your hands to cover coughs and sneezes.

RELATED: Coronavirus FAQ: Here’s what you need to know about the COVID-19 outbreak

• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

• Stay home when you are sick and keep children home when they are sick.

• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

• Get a flu shot. (Although the flu shot does not protect against COVID-19, it is flu season.)

This story has been updated.

Decatur, GA- The Decatur City Commission at its March 16 meeting declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic and granted the mayor emergency powers.

Due to social distancing measures, the meeting was a quorum only, consisting of Mayor Patti Garrett, Mayor Pro Tem Tony Powers and Commissioner Kelly Walsh.

The city is not ordering the closure of bars and restaurants, but Mayor Garrett said that option remains on the table for now.

In a related measure, the city also expanded its leave benefits and granted paid sick leave for parttime employees, like school crossing guards who are out of work now that the schools have closed indefinitely.

Just before the meeting, the city announced that all city buildings are closed until further notice. This includes the cancelation of municipal court through April 13. A full announcement on that is published at the end of this article.

The expanded leave policy allows employees to use unearned leave, City Manager Andrea Arnold said, and expands the time employees would need to provide medical documentation. If employees can work remotely, they will be expected to work their regularly scheduled hours. Full-time employees who cannot work remotely will be on paid administrative leave. The new policy will be evaluated every 30 days.

Commissioners unanimously approved a resolution declaring a public health state of emergency which temporarily gives the mayor some emergency powers and relaxes some city regulations.

The city manager will recommend the adoption of certain measures that may be necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Competitive bid requirements will be temporarily suspended.

Under the city’s code, the mayor temporarily has the power to:

– Enforce all rules, laws, and regulations relating to emergency management and to assume direct operational control over all emergency management resources; – Seize or take for temporary use, any private property for the protection of the public; – Sell, lend, give or distribute all or any such property or supplies among the inhabitants … and to maintain a strict accounting of property or supplies distributed and for funds received for such property or supplies; and – Perform and exercise such other functions and duties, and take such emergency actions as may be necessary to promote and secure the safety, protection and well-being of the inhabitants Source: City of Decatur Code of Ordinances.

The resolution expires on April 16 unless it is renewed.

“The thought behind this was even though we have a state of emergency at the state level and national level, this assures us we are able to work at the local level in a quick and expedient manner if it is necessary,” Garrett said. “It gives us the legal authority.”

Mayor Pro Tem Powers said the resolution gives the city authority to consider things like a curfew and closing or limiting restaurants and bars.

“It’s a fluid situation,” Powers said. “It’s probably going to change daily at best, if not hourly.”

Mayor Garrett said the resolution could also make recovery funds available to the city after the crisis has ended. Garrett noted that city-sponsored events have been postponed, after school programs have stopped and business-related travel for employees has stopped.

Garrett said the number of people restaurants over the weekend was a concern for her.

“It is concerning that we have residents that are not doing this [social distancing] and we saw it over the weekend and I hope as our restaurants are continuing to be open at this point, I hope that social distancing is important enough to everyone to take those good health and protection recommendations seriously,” she said.

But she stopped short of calling for those businesses to close and announced that city-owned parking would now be free for 30 minutes so people can pick up to-go orders from restaurants. Garrett said any closures would need to be coordinated with other cities and the county. The city of Brookhaven has already moved ahead with a temporary closure of restaurants and bars, except for delivery and take out.

“County and cities within the county are giving serious consideration to closing all bars and restaurants,” Garrett said. “We understand the financial hardships.”

Mayor Pro Tem Powers said there will be hard days ahead.

“It’s going to be a challenging time,” he said. “Every day is going to be different which is going to require a lot of personal sacrifice and a lot of patience, but at the end of the day, we need to maintain that level of civility. That’s what’s going to get us through this.”

Coronavirus","DOUGLASVILLE, GA — Faced with too few coronavirus test kits and an intensive care unit filled to capacity, the Douglas County Board of Health Wednesday unanimously approved an order mandating shelter-in-place, limited gatherings and closed restaurants except for takeout and delivery. The vote followed more than two hours of debate via teleconference, with audio livestreamed to Facebook.

Drawn from pieces of similar orders from Cobb and Carroll Counties, the Douglas County order requires residents to stay at home unless absolutely necessary, restricts gatherings to 10 or fewer people, and closes restaurants except for drive-through, takeout or delivery.

""Although testing is increasing, it's not at the place where we need,"" said Dr. Janet Pak Memark, district health director of Cobb & Douglas Public Health. ""If we do nothing, the cases will surge beyond our ability to take care of the patients.""

Don't miss updates about precautions in Georgia as they are announced. Sign up for Patch news alerts and newsletters.



Memark told the board via teleconference that the lone drive-through testing site in Cobb County was testing only 30 patients a day, far fewer than the number of people likely infected with the coronavirus. Test results generally are not available until at least three days after testing. At the same time, all 19 intensive-care beds at WellStar Douglas Hospital are already occupied.

As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, 17 coronavirus infections and one related death had been reported in Douglas County. Memark said that the newest cases of the viruses appeared to be due to community spread and not from outside infection.

The final order with details will be posted by Patch.com when it becomes available.

New numbers announced Wednesday night show that 438 Georgians are hospitalized, 47 have died, and 1,387 have been infected with coronavirus, the Georgia Department of Public Health said.

There have been 4,697 tests done in a commercial lab, with 1,172 coming back positive. The DPH has done 1,482 tests, with 215 positive.

The vote came during a called teleconference meeting broadcast via YouTube.

On Wednesday, the Douglas County Board of Health spent two hours hammering out the order, which mandates shelter-in-place, limited gatherings and closed restaurants except for takeout and delivery. At that time, 17 cases of the new coronavirus and one death related to it had been reported in Douglas County, and the intensive-care unit at WellStar Douglas Hospital already was filled to capacity.

""The number 17 doesn't sound like a very big number, but that's only what we know,"" said Mayor Pro Tem Terry Miller. ""We may have a lot more cases out there that we're not aware of. It's all about the math.""

The new restrictions include:

Citizens are to shelter in place, with no unnecessary travel.

Restaurants no longer can offer dine-in and are limited to drive-through, takeout and delivery. Restaurants already licensed to serve beer or wine can sell unopened containers for consumption off premises.

Non-essential businesses may open between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. as long as at least 6 feet of social distancing is maintained.

""Essential"" businesses include grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, media, hardware stores and plumbers — basically, all businesses required for life to go on minimally. ""The definition is very broad,"" said Suzan Littlefield, chief assistant city attorney.

Don't miss updates about precautions in Georgia as they are announced. Sign up for Patch news alerts and newsletters.



Council members spent much of the hour-long meeting debating what to limit and how strictly to enforce those limits. Ultimately, they decided to go with a lighter touch.

""We will be more in a compassionate mode than we will be in making arrests,"" said councilman Mark Adams. He said that he saw the ordinance more as a means to inform citizens and that he hoped they would honor it ""as a matter of personal responsibility.""

""We will not be arresting anyone unless they become completely disorderly,"" said Douglasville police chief Gary Sparks.

""This is a very difficult thing to do,"" Mayor Rochelle Robinson said of the newly endorsed restrictions. ""We've been trying to do the best for our community, and it's not taken lightly.""

Although Douglas County has relatively few cases thus far, she noted that it's ""nestled in"" next to much harder hit counties in metro Atlanta. ""The only weapon we have (in the absence of a vaccine) is social distancing,"" she said.

The full ordinance is posted on the City of Douglasville's website.

Duluth will be under emergency declaration until the council decides to terminate it, spokeswoman Alisa Williams said. Duluth City Council is allowed to meet via teleconference and the will postpone or cancel all other scheduled meetings and hearings while it’s under the emergency declaration.

Suwanee’s emergency declaration, which expires March 23 but can be renewed, does not explicitly address teleconference meetings, but the city will be allowed to hold them while under emergency declaration due to the Georgia Open Meetings Act.

Regular meetings like city council require 24 hours notice even when a city is under an emergency declaration, but emergency meetings can be called without a day’s notice.

The Duluth resolution passed Friday afternoon also extends deadlines for occupational taxes, alcohol license renewals and “all other licenses or fees” owed to the city until June 30. Any alcohol taxes that acrue through June 30 can be paid in six installments, according to the Duluth emergency declaration.

All gyms, movie theaters, performance spaces, bowling alleys and entertainment centers must close in Suwanee under an executive order issued by Mayor Jimmy Burnette.

Bars and restaurants in both Suwanee and Duluth must close to in-person dining, drinking and entertainment, and must reduce person-to-person contact as much as possible. Businesses in both cities will be allowed to sell unopened beer and wine to go if they have a permit to serve alcohol. Workers in the city must maintain a six-foot distance from each other whenever possible, the order says.

Not all emergency orders have included bans on in-person dining or other businesses that facilitate large groups of people. Gwinnett County, Norcross and Lawrenceville have issued statements and orders encouraging businesses to limit in-person contact, but have not strictly banned in-person dining or the operations of theaters and gyms. Lawrenceville Mayor David Still issued a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more Friday afternoon.

Both cities had already closed many public buildings in order to reduce personal contact and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Gwinnett County has 20 cases COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.

Empire,GA,03-21-2020 23:21,https://www.wsav.com/c19emergency/,LIST: COVID-19 emergency declarations in Coastal Empire and Lowcountry,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (WSAV) – In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, national, state and local leaders are taking emergency action to slow or prevent the spread of the virus.

In recent days, President Donald Trump, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp have each issued various public health emergency orders.

Public schools, colleges and universities in Georgia and South Carolina have moved to online learning in the wake of the outbreak. On Monday, McMaster took emergency action prohibiting groups larger than three and Kemp issued a measure for the “medically fragile” to quarantine.

At this time in the Coastal Empire and Lowcountry, there are no curfews or shelter-in-place orders.

But what does a state of emergency mean at the local level? In most cases, the following applies:

All bars and nightclubs, which do not serve food, close

All gyms and fitness centers, movie theaters, live performance venues, bowling alleys and arcades close

Restaurants and other eating/drinking establishments where food is served must reduce seating capacity by 50% for dine-in services; delivery, drive-thru, take-out available

*Not applicable to cafeterias in hospitals, nursing homes, hospice centers and similar facilities

*Not applicable to cafeterias in hospitals, nursing homes, hospice centers and similar facilities Funerals consisting of more than 10 mourners encouraged to conduct graveside services only or postpone to a future date

All sightseeing, guided and/or narrated tours must cease

For many areas, these measures will remain in place for either two weeks or 30 days, unless further action is taken. And in counties, cities and towns that have not issued emergency declarations, many have closed government buildings and community centers.

Though the city has issued no social distancing or business closure measures, Johnson encouraged citizens to adhere to guidelines from the Ga. Department of Public Health.

“City of Fayetteville leaders are in continuous communication with county and state health official regarding the coronavirus pandemic, and we are grateful for the community’s patience and cooperation as we navigate this challenging time,” said Johnson.

“While the City of Fayetteville has not mandated any social distancing or business closure measures, we do stand with the Georgia Department of Public Health in encouraging the following guidance expressed by the District 4 Public Health office.

“Based on the Centers for Disease Control recommendations regarding social distancing, District 4 Public Health recommends food service facilities go to a carryout/drive-thru only model. Facilities who decide to continue in-house dining are strongly encouraged to remove at least half of their seats in an effort to limit the number of customers to provide social distancing. Facilities are required to continue using proper protocols for cleaning and sanitizing frequently used surfaces. Please take these measures to protect your employees and customers.”

Johnson said the city’s website, www.Fayetteville-GA.gov, has been updated repeatedly since the coronavirus pandemic was declared. Click the COVID-19 at the top, and you will find many helpful resources there about the pandemic. The website includes information about how residents and other city customers can continue engaging the government remotely while city buildings are closed to the public. Many services and accounts can be accessed online, and a special page has been built to aggregate that information: www.Fayetteville-GA.gov/Transactions.

“As always, the City of Fayetteville Public Safety and other essential services, such as water, sewer, and solid waste collections, are operating as normal. In an emergency, dial 911,” said Johnson. “Again, thank you for your cooperation and understanding as the City of Fayetteville continues to adjust and adapt to the coronavirus situation in order to better protect and serve the community, ‘our small business owners,’ and our employees.”​",None,17802.0,33.45,-84.4709

(WJBF) – The City of Grovetown has passed new ordinances in the effort to combat the spread of COVID-19 within the city.

The new ordinance calls for the closure of specific business activities.

Beginning at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, March 24th, and lasting through at least April 5th, all restaurants offering only dine-in options will close, as will personal grooming businesses (hairdressers, barbers, nail salons) and entertainment venues.

The ordinance also prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people regardless of location.

Businesses with less than 30,000 square feet of space may not have more than 10 customers inside at any one time, and businesses with more than 30,000 square feet may have no more than 50 customers at any one time.

These rules do not yet apply to grocery stores and pharmacies. Grocery stores, banks, pharmacies, gas stations and medical facilities are not included in any closures.

Read the full release below:

Citizens of Grovetown – The City Council and I continue to monitor the spread of the coronavirus across the nation and the State of Georgia and study the impact of actions and decisions of neighboring governments and leaders. Based on what we know, we believe it is prudent to extend the actions we have already taken to protect our citizens’ health and safety. Therefore, at 1:00 p.m. this afternoon the City Council and I unanimously passed an emergency ordinance to extend coronavirus protections and closures. Building on the decision to close City buildings and facilities last week, this new ordinance directs the closure of select business activities. Specifically, effective 12:01 a.m. tomorrow – March 24, 2020 – and lasting through at least April 5, 2020, all restaurants offering only dine-in options will close, as will personal grooming businesses – hairdressers, barbers, nail salons – and entertainment venues. The ordinance prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people regardless of location. Other City of Grovetown retail sales establishments will be permitted to remain open, but with restrictions. Businesses with less than 30,000 square feet of space may not have more than 10 customers inside at any one time, and businesses with more than 30,000 square feet may have no more than 50 customers at any one time. These rules do not yet apply to grocery stores and pharmacies, but residents should exercise social distancing to the maximum extent possible, remaining at least 6 feet away from one another. Grocery stores, banks, pharmacies, gas stations, and medical facilities are not included in any closures, but we ask proprietors to establish systems to keep customers and employees safe. To the extent possible, monitor customer’s temperatures and provide hand sanitizer prior to entry – not admitting those running a temperature – and ensure patrons maintain adequate distances from one another, especially when in payment lines. A city curfew is not yet in effect, but the City Council will continue to proactively monitor this highly fluid situation and make decisions as circumstances warrant to keep our residents safe and healthy. Governor Kemp is scheduled to make an announcement today at 5:00 p.m. about COVID-19. Grovetown residents can expect additional announcements in the coming days from City leaders as we learn more from the Columbia County and State of Georgia Departments of Public Safety. The City Council and I continue to do all in our power to protect our citizens and ask for all citizens’ cooperation with these and any new procedures. If you do not need to go out Stay Home to Save Lives. To remain updated on City closures and other decisions, we encourage residents to monitor the City of Grovetown website at www.cityofgrovetown.com, the Grovetown Facebook site, and to call the Grovetown Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at 706-863-5674, Option 1, Monday through Friday between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. — Mayor Gary E.

-- No test kits available locally

March 14, 2020 -- There will be a meeting here at my office next Monday, March 16. The executive officers of our local governments, agency heads of all emergency service entities in the county, representatives from our public and private schools, along with representatives from our health department and local hospital will be in attendance. We will hopefully come up with some answers to some of the public’s concerns at this meeting.

In my capacity as EMA Director, I can say that we have received no new information from the Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA), nor any new information from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), that differs from what the national and local news media outlets have already broadcast. The most recent and comprehensive information regarding the virus is available from the Georgia Department of Public Health and this is a link to their website: https://northcentralhealthdistrict.org/coronavirus/

It is my understanding that there are NO test kits available locally at this time. People with dry coughs or fever and flu-like symptoms should contact their medical provider and follow the provider’s instructions. Your medical provider will advise you regarding testing if your symptoms meet the criteria for testing. Elderly people and people with existing health problems should avoid contact with crowds and persons who might possibly be infected with the virus.

The following closures are in effect at this time:

Putnam County Public Schools will be closed for students from Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 20. Teachers and other employees should report for work on Monday the 16th and will receive further instructions at that time.

Grand Jury and jury trials for Putnam County and the other seven counties (Baldwin, Greene, Hancock, Jasper, Jones, Morgan, and Wilkinson) of our circuit are canceled for the next 30 days. Other Superior Court functions will remain open until further notice.

The Putnam County Recreation Department is closed through the end of next week, Sunday, March 22.

We will update information regarding closures just as soon as we are notified of such.

I urge people to remain calm, practice good hygiene, and use good old common sense until they receive other official notices from legitimate government entities.

Thanks,

HRS

State Senator Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, said on Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus. Beach was at the Georgia Capitol on Monday for the special session.

He will now be in a 14-day quarantine at home. Beach released a statement:

""After experiencing a fever and cough, I sought medical attention last week. The diagnosis I was given was not coronavirus, but I did get tested for it on Saturday. With medication, I felt better by Monday and thought I was in the clear. Today, however, my test came back positive.

For now, I'm at home. I continue to suffer from a fever and cough, but I'm following doctor's orders, including the admonition to stay away from the hospital unless it becomes difficult to breathe. I know many Georgians are praying hard as we weather this crisis together, and frankly, I'd ask that they pray for me, as well as all the others in our state who are going through this right now – and those who soon will.

I know I face a difficult two weeks, but I'll work to keep everyone updated on my progress. With the support of my wife – who is keeping a safe distance and so far doesn't have symptoms – and my family and friends, I know I'll get through this and get back to work for my constituents.""

Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan released a statement Wednesday that said he will be in self-quarantine due to the positive test results from Beach.

New numbers released Thursday from the Georgia Department of Public Health show there have been 10 deaths and 287 cases of coronavirus across the state.

With the new cases, the DPH released the numbers of tests taken across the state, which totaled more than 1,800.

There have been 1,323 tests done in a commercial lab, with 174 coming in positive. The Department of Public Health Lab has done 508 tests, and had 113 positives.

The number of confirmed and presumed positive cases of COVID-19 rose from 197 on Wednesday to 287 cases in 28 counties on Thursday.

Globally, more than 222,000 people have been infected and more than 9,100 people have died from the new coronavirus, Johns Hopkins reported Thursday.

“I believe it is in the best interest of the City to declare a local state of emergency to provide certain emergency powers to cope with such an emergency for the protection, safety, health and welfare of the public,” said Mayor David Still in a press release. “In addition, this action will allow the City to be creative in responding to the needs of our local businesses in order to lessen the impact to their bottom line.”

Other cities that have declared states of emergency include Atlanta, Norcross and Brookhaven.

City of Marietta Declares Emergency Situation, Provides Resources for Small Businesses

MARIETTA – On Tuesday, March 24th, City Council declared an emergency situation within the City of Marietta and enacted emergency measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in conjunction with Governor Kemp's Emergency Declaration and Federal Health Guidelines.



The City's declaration does the following:

Places restrictions on bars, restaurants, and other on-premise food consumption businesses to allow for food only take away and delivery options until the expiration of the resolution on April 10th

Any business involving close physical contact will not be able to operate until the expiration of the resolution – this includes hair salons, beauty shops, barber shops, nail salons, and tattoo parlors

It limits parks and outdoor facilities' hours of operation from 6:00 am to 8:00 pm. All playgrounds and organized sports are suspended until April 10th. All pavilion rentals will be suspended or refunded during this time. All parks facilities will operate in a manner consistent with the CDC recommended 6-foot personal distance requirements.

Businesses will be required to implement policies to enforce social distancing among its employees, agents, and customers.

Telecommuting and home offices will be allowed in residential zoning during the time period.

All zoning and land use matters that require a public hearing will be postponed until after April 10th.

As part of the Special Called Meeting to make the declaration, City Council also voted to extend the due date for business license renewal payments to May 30th and to establish six 15-minute parking spots around the Square for curbside pickup in an effort to help small businesses continue to operate while following CDC guidelines relating to social distancing.

Our Economic Development Division has created a COVID-19 information page on its website to serve as a resource to all City businesses during these uncertain times. We will continuously share resources and assistance opportunities as they arise. Because Georgia has officially been listed as a declared state for Coronavirus (COVID-19), Georgia small businesses now qualify to apply for the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The details on how to apply for those loans and other helpful information is contained on that website.

The City of Marietta will remain open and able to provide government services to all its residents while in the declaration of an emergency situation. We will work to prevent disruption of services, sanitation will continue to run, and City Hall will remain open, with proper health restrictions, to the public while ensuring the health and well-being of our employees, their families and our residents. All City Buildings and floors within those buildings now have dispensers installed with hand sanitizer available to the public and employees and protective shields are being used along with physical distancing. We also have access to sanitizing machines. We plan to use them to sanitize prisoner transport vans, police cars, fire trucks and any other equipment that is in the field and can come in contact with the public. We will also sanitize buildings and other public places as needed.

We are in constant contact with the Cobb Douglas Public Health Department on a daily basis. Our leadership is participating in regular conference calls with Federal Agencies and the White House. The City has plans in place to respond to staff reductions resulting from any illnesses and we have solutions we can use if needed to ensure continuation of services.

Milton,GA,03-19-2020 11:01,https://patch.com/georgia/alpharetta/coronavirus-alpharetta-adopts-emergency-operations-ordinance,"Coronavirus: Alpharetta, Milton Adopt Emergency Ordinance","ALPHARETTA/MILTON, GA — The Alpharetta City Council adopted an Emergency Operations Ordinance Monday that puts in place temporary measures to allow the local government to more quickly respond to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. The ordinance guarantees the continued provision of essential services and also allows for Alpharetta's elected officials to conduct meetings, including binding votes, via email.

""This is an extraordinary time in our history,"" Mayor Jim Gilvin said. ""As the elected representatives of the people of Alpharetta, it is this council's duty to make sure we can continue to conduct the business of the City of Alpharetta for the people of this community. That is why we are enacting this ordinance today; to ensure we have the ability to continue to serve and protect our citizens and our employees for the next 30 days in the face of the unusual circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.""

The ordinance allows the Alpharetta City Council to temporarily vote on actions via email without advertising or convening a public meeting. It further provides that the ordinance can be extended for an additional 30 days or repealed by a majority vote of the City Council.

""It gives us the flexibility that the private sector has to make decisions more quickly and enable us to provide services without requiring people to put their health at risk by coming to or gathering in our facilities,"" Gilvin said.

In keeping with the guidance issued by federal, state, and county health officials and the emergency declaration issued by Gov. Brian Kemp, Alpharetta has already closed all its facilities to the public and cancelled all city meetings and events through April 12. While maintaining essential services such public safety, public works, and trash collection, the city has instructed all employees who can perform their duties by teleworking from home to do so. Those who must physically be at work are under direction to not gather in groups larger than necessary to complete their assigned tasks.

""We continue to closely follow the guidance issued by health professionals at the federal, state, and county level and will adjust our policies as quickly as possible as that guidance is updated to reflect this evolving situation,"" Gilvin said. ""We appreciate everyone's patience as we make these changes, and we assure the public that we will remove the measures enabled by today's ordinance as soon as possible.""

The City of Alpharetta encourages the public to follow guidance as it is issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has established a website to make it easy for everyone to access factual information about the Covid-19 situation, CDC guidance, and the city's response and prevention efforts.

Milton City Hall closed to public; Milton City Council passes emergency ordinance

As part of efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, the City of Milton closed City Hall to the public effective Monday - the same day the city council passed an emergency ordinance that extends for the next 30 days.

There will also be no further access to Milton's Police headquarters and fire stations as well as City Hall, meaning all city buildings will be closed to the public. The city has previously announced that there will be no Milton Municipal Court sessions in the coming weeks, in addition to calling off meetings, programs, and facility rentals due to COVID-19.

""The public's health and safety - including that of City employees - is our foremost priority,"" Milton Mayor Joe Lockwood said. ""We don't want to put anyone at unnecessary risk.

""Still, even if city buildings are closed, that doesn't mean city operations are closed. We will continue to serve Milton residents, providing them with the services they need and deserve, as best we can.""



The 30-day time range for these closures and cancellations aligns with the emergency ordinance approved Monday night by the City Council. In accordance with the city's charter, the ordinance aims to ""provide for the operation of the city of Milton during the public emergency."" Among other elements, this ordinance states that ""all matters requiring a public hearing ... are hereby stayed for 30 days.""

""We take our responsibilities to the citizens of Milton very seriously, including the need to be as transparent and clear as possible,"" Lockwood said. ""That is why the council approved this emergency ordinance: to legally document actions we want to undertake to slow the spread of this coronavirus.""

Any permits that lapse during this time ""remain in full force,"" according to the ordinance.

Initially, the city announced closures and cancellations through April 12. All those - in athletic programs, events, and the like - will now extend a few more days, city leaders will continuously evaluate the situation, and these plans may change at any time.



Even with buildings closed to the public, city employees throughout government will continue to serve our citizens in myriad ways. There will still be inspections and permits issued, for instance. The Public Works Department will maintain right of way and tackle other projects. Police officers will continue to patrol Milton, working diligently to keep the city safe for all. And members of the Milton Fire-Rescue Department will keep responding to calls for fires and medical emergencies.

State Senator Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, said on Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus. Beach was at the Georgia Capitol on Monday for the special session.



He will now be in a 14-day quarantine at home. Beach released a statement:

""After experiencing a fever and cough, I sought medical attention last week. The diagnosis I was given was not coronavirus, but I did get tested for it on Saturday. With medication, I felt better by Monday and thought I was in the clear. Today, however, my test came back positive.

For now, I'm at home. I continue to suffer from a fever and cough, but I'm following doctor's orders, including the admonition to stay away from the hospital unless it becomes difficult to breathe. I know many Georgians are praying hard as we weather this crisis together, and frankly, I'd ask that they pray for me, as well as all the others in our state who are going through this right now – and those who soon will.

I know I face a difficult two weeks, but I'll work to keep everyone updated on my progress. With the support of my wife – who is keeping a safe distance and so far doesn't have symptoms – and my family and friends, I know I'll get through this and get back to work for my constituents.""

There are no known cases within city limits, but the emergency declaration allows the city to work towards preventing its spread. The city council’s first action in declaring the emergency was to approve holding meetings by teleconference.

The state of emergency will last until April 17 and can be renewed if necessary. The city code regarding emergencies is vague, saying they can be used to make “all reasonable provisions deemed necessary to deal with or meet such an emergency for the protection, safety, health or well-being of the citizens of the city.”

The city had already closed a park to groups larger than 10, closed its municipal court and altered employees’ schedules to reduce in-person interaction. The Norcross Police Department has asked the public to call before coming to its headquarters and will be taking reports for more incidents over the phone.

Future meetings of the Norcross City Council will be streamed on Facebook and the city website.

Johnson made the state-of-emergency announcement during a teleconference call with all City Council members on Thursday afternoon, as part of a new regular initiative to provide updates on matters related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Johnson earlier indicated that he was considering this action during a video message posted on Saturday, March 14.

""I don’t take it lightly,"" Johnson said of his decision to make the state-of-emergency declaration, adding that although no confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been diagnosed in Savannah by Thursday afternoon, he is certain that its spread here is imminent or already underway. ""We have reason to believe that there are unconfirmed cases out there. ... We have to be very clear about where we are.""

With an aim toward limiting gatherings of people which could speed the transmission of the highly contagious coronavirus, Savannah’s state-of-emergency declaration contains the following directives:

• All bars and nightclubs that do not serve food will be closed.

• Restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments must reduce seating capacity by 50 percent for dine-in services. These eateries may continue to prepare and serve food and drink via delivery, drive-through, and takeout. Cafeterias in hospitals, nursing homes, hospice centers and similar facilities will not be subject to these restrictions and may continue normal operations.

• All gyms, fitness centers, movie theaters, live-performance venues, bowling alleys, and arcades will be closed.

• All sightseeing, guided and/or narrated tours must stop operations.

• Funerals with more than 10 mourners are encouraged to conduct graveside services only or to postpone indoor services to a future date.

• All of Savannah’s public metered parking and garage parking will be free for the first hour, to give drivers time to pick up food.

The emergency declaration also allows City Manager Pat Monahan to activate emergency operations plans, according to a press release issued by a Savannah spokesperson after the teleconference call. City employees will soon begin working from home as directed by Monahan.

The declaration is scheduled to last through April 5, unless it is canceled or extended, Johnson said. The full City Council will need to vote on the declaration at their next meeting, scheduled for Thursday, March 26.

During the teleconference call, Johnson also spoke with council members about other coronavirus-related issues affecting Savannah, ranging from safety measures for city employees to plans for protecting the homeless.

Johnson mentioned that Chatham County’s first drive-through COVID-19 site will begin operating on Saturday, March 21, under the auspices of the Coastal Health District, but stressed that it is only available to patients who are referred to be tested by a doctor.

Furthermore, Johnson said that the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System will use 12 area schools as food-distribution centers for underprivileged students.

Although Governor Brian Kemp declared that all of Georgia’s public schools will remain closed until at least April 2, Johnson said that several of Savannah’s campuses will continue to prepare and serve meals during the closure, including Gadsden, Brock, and Henderson elementary schools, and Groves, Savannah, and Johnson high schools.",state_of_emergency,280082.0,32.0281,-81.1785

Despite the emergency declaration, Dacula will still hold its local election on Tuesday. The city cites “express authorization” given by the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office on March 16 as its reason for proceeding with the vote despite concerns over the spread of the virus.

READ | Gwinnett closes playgrounds, outdoor sports facilities due to coronavirus

Emergency declarations give cities additional powers to hold meetings on short notice, use teleconferencing to reduce person-to-person contact and issue executive orders banning actions that could worsen the situation. Dacula’s emergency declaration does not directly address any of these options, but it still has these powers.

Snellville’s emergency declaration allows restaurants in city limits to sell unopened beer and wine and beer growlers to go. Snellville is not placing restrictions on group gatherings or movement, but encourages residents to shelter in place — not leave their homes unless necessary — and to practice social distancing.

Norcross, Lawrenceville, Duluth, Sugar Hill and Suwanee had previously issued state of emergency declarations. Each city is handling it slightly differently, with Suwanee and Duluth banning in-person dining but Lawrenceville officially discouraging it. Norcross’ police chief has discouraged residents from gathering in groups of 10 or more.

Suwanee and Duluth both approved emergency declarations, Suwanee on Thursday and Duluth on Friday.

READ | State of emergency: Coronavirus changes how local governments meet

Duluth will be under emergency declaration until the council decides to terminate it, spokeswoman Alisa Williams said. Duluth City Council is allowed to meet via teleconference and the will postpone or cancel all other scheduled meetings and hearings while it’s under the emergency declaration.

Suwanee’s emergency declaration, which expires March 23 but can be renewed, does not explicitly address teleconference meetings, but the city will be allowed to hold them while under emergency declaration due to the Georgia Open Meetings Act.

Regular meetings like city council require 24 hours notice even when a city is under an emergency declaration, but emergency meetings can be called without a day’s notice.

The Duluth resolution passed Friday afternoon also extends deadlines for occupational taxes, alcohol license renewals and “all other licenses or fees” owed to the city until June 30. Any alcohol taxes that acrue through June 30 can be paid in six installments, according to the Duluth emergency declaration.

All gyms, movie theaters, performance spaces, bowling alleys and entertainment centers must close in Suwanee under an executive order issued by Mayor Jimmy Burnette.

Bars and restaurants in both Suwanee and Duluth must close to in-person dining, drinking and entertainment, and must reduce person-to-person contact as much as possible. Businesses in both cities will be allowed to sell unopened beer and wine to go if they have a permit to serve alcohol. Workers in the city must maintain a six-foot distance from each other whenever possible, the order says.

Not all emergency orders have included bans on in-person dining or other businesses that facilitate large groups of people. Gwinnett County, Norcross and Lawrenceville have issued statements and orders encouraging businesses to limit in-person contact, but have not strictly banned in-person dining or the operations of theaters and gyms. Lawrenceville Mayor David Still issued a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more Friday afternoon.

Both cities had already closed many public buildings in order to reduce personal contact and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Gwinnett County has 20 cases COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.

Tucker, GA – Tucker Mayor Frank Auman has instituted a curfew to stop the spread of coronavirus.

Currently, there are no reported cases in Tucker, but testing for the virus has been limited.

As of March 20, there are now 420 confirmed cases in Georgia, a 46 percent increase in confirmed cases since March 19. There have been 13 deaths statewide. Yesterday there were 10 reported deaths.

In DeKalb County, there are now 35 confirmed cases, up from 22 reported yesterday.

Auman implemented the following policies:

– A curfew imposed between the hours or 9 p.m. and 6 a.m.

– All businesses must comply with FEMA guidelines

– An order that any public gatherings within the City of Tucker meet with federal guidelines in terms of group size and social distancing

“Our general approach has been to allow as much freedom as possible to our people and businesses to continue normal activities as long as they could and would comply with guidance from our state and federal public health authorities,” Auman said. “The public response here in Tucker has been astounding and gratifying. Businesses have voluntarily closed or severely modified their practices [and] the public has been more cooperative than we could have hoped for.

“Now, despite all the voluntary compliance, I have reached the conclusion that we have run out of the logic that allows us to proceed on that basis alone, and that we must enforce certain restrictions to protect the public.”

The rules take effect at midnight this Friday evening, March 20.

The City Council held a meeting two nights ago to issue an emergency declaration.

The Tucker recreation center is closed. The city hall and annex are staffed with essential personnel only.

For now, the City Council meeting for Monday at 7 p.m. is still on. It will be held at the city hall annex.

A Tucker spokesperson said, “We will practice social distancing, so many of Council will be joining over the phone and anyone who shows up from the public will be spaced out appropriately.”

Both counties also declared state of emergencies on Monday.

WASHINGTON COUNTY

In a Facebook post Monday, the Washington County Sheriff's Office says the Board of Commissioners consulted with the county Board of Health and Emergency Management Agency before declaring a state of emergency.

The declaration stops gatherings of 10 or more people including church services, funerals, family reunions, and political events starting Tuesday.

A curfew for nonessential travel was also issued between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., the Facebook post says. This does not include work-related travel and emergency situations. The curfew starts Monday night.

The post makes it clear the declaration does NOT stop businesses with 10 or more employees from operating.

This comes as the Georgia Department of Public Health reported the county's first confirmed case of COVID-19 Monday at noon.

The declaration is in place until further notice.

Here's a list of Central Georgia counties and cities that have a curfew.

DODGE COUNTY

Dodge County's state of emergency includes the city of Eastman and will last at least through April 20.

The declaration stops all in-person services at Eastman City Hall and restricts public access to city buildings. You must now make an appointment to visit.

The declaration also stops public and in-person dining, but restaurants an offer take out options. Unopened containers of beer and wine can also be sold for take out.

Customers are not allowed inside the business to order, and employees must maintain a safe distance of six feet from each other.

The county and city of Eastman encourage the elderly to stay at home, businesses to allow employees to work remotely, and people to maintain a proper social distance.

The declaration issues a curfew banning all nonessential travel between 10 p.m. and 6 p.m. The curfew starts Monday night and should last at least through April 20.

Dodge County does not have a confirmed COVID-19 case at this time, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.

""The borough understands the public's concerns about COVID-19 and our health officer is working closely with local, county and state officials to monitor and respond to the situation,"" officials stated.

Leaders of the City of Crouch are asking people to avoid Crouch and the Garden Valley area at this time amid COVID-19 concerns.

City leaders say they are following current CDC and Central District Health Idaho recommendations to maintain gathering limitations to 10 or fewer people at a time, limit social situations and maintain proper hygiene.

As Crouch and the surrounding areas are tourist destinations, city leaders say the increase in visitors will increase the risk of exposure from coronavirus.

The city says they have noticed an increase in visitors coming to Crouch and the Garden Valley area from the Treasure Valley. This increase is putting a strain on depleted grocery stores, as well as stressing out their local EMS system and putting pressure on Crouch residents.

City leaders are acting in accordance with the City of McCall and the City of Cascade, in that they are requesting visitors to avoid Crouch and the Garden Valley area until further notice.

Pullman declares State of Emergency

On Thursday, Pullman Mayor Glenn Johnson declared a State of Emergency.

The emergency declaration facilitates potential future assistance related to COVID-19, more commonly known as coronavirus. This includes assistance from the Small Business Administration, and access to regional and state resources.

The declaration is a means to ensure all necessary resources will be available, according to a statement from the city.

There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Whitman County.

The city has also opened an Emergency Operations Center at the Pullman Police Department, which will manage emergency-related information and resources as needed.

Mayor Johnson also urged Pullman residents to continue supporting local business.

“This support is critical to maintaining our local economy, and he knows that our local businesses have instituted additional measures to protect employees’ and consumers’ health. The City of Pullman will help connect businesses to loans as they become available from the SBA,” the city’s statement reads.

Thirty people have died and at least 366 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Washington state. More than 3,000 people have tested negative.

Senators: “We must take every possible step to secure our nation’s blood supply in this critical time.”

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the midst of a nationwide shortage of donated blood spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) are leading a group of their colleagues in raising concerns with the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) discriminatory blood donation deferral policy for men who have sex with men (MSM).

While government health officials encourage every healthy individual to consider donating blood, the FDA continues to enforce a discriminatory donor deferral policy that effectively prohibits many healthy gay and bisexual men from doing so. In their letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Senators urge the administration to swiftly change these discriminatory blood donation policies to help save lives.

The Senators write, “We write to express our concern with the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) discriminatory blood donor deferral policy for men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly in the midst of a nationwide shortage of donated blood and blood products spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. We must take every possible step to secure our nation’s blood supply in this critical time, and in order to do so, we need to shift away from antiquated and stigmatizing donation policies to ones that are scientifically sound, based on individual risk, and inclusive of all potential healthy blood donors.

They continue, “… while government health officials encourage every healthy individual to consider donating blood, the FDA continues to enforce a discriminatory donor deferral policy that effectively prohibits many healthy gay and bisexual men from doing so.

The Senators conclude, “In light of this shortage, we urge you to swiftly update blood donor deferral policies in favor of ones that are grounded in science, are based on individual risk factors, do not unfairly single out one group of individuals, and allow all healthy Americans to donate. We strongly encourage you to consider this critical solution as you work to develop a comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure that Americans have access to life-saving blood transfusions.”

The letter was also signed by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The full letter is available here and below. An online version of this release is available here.

Dear Commissioner Hahn,

We write to express our concern with the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) discriminatory blood donor deferral policy for men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly in the midst of a nationwide shortage of donated blood and blood products spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. We must take every possible step to secure our nation’s blood supply in this critical time, and in order to do so, we need to shift away from antiquated and stigmatizing donation policies to ones that are scientifically sound, based on individual risk, and inclusive of all potential healthy blood donors.

It is vital that all Americans have access to the health care services they need during this outbreak, and for many individuals, including accident and trauma victims, organ transplant recipients and cancer patients, blood transfusions remain a necessary component of care. Unfortunately, our nation’s blood supply has been severely constrained due to a decline in healthy donations. In fact, AABB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks, has predicted 355,000 fewer blood donations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.

During this crisis, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Brett Giroir, and Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which oversees the safety of blood and blood products in the United States, have all expressed that blood donation for healthy individuals remains safe and is much needed. But while government health officials encourage every healthy individual to consider donating blood, the FDA continues to enforce a discriminatory donor deferral policy that effectively prohibits many healthy gay and bisexual men from doing so.

We are steadfastly committed to ending this policy and encourage the FDA to shift to scientific practices that secure our nation’s blood supply based on individual risk rather than the perpetuation of inaccurate stereotypes. We have written to your agency on this subject in the past and have appreciated the FDA’s willingness to engage in discussions and make changes to the MSM deferral policy. In 2015, the agency took the important step of moving from a lifetime ban to a one-year deferral policy after last sexual contact.

However, with important advances in blood screening and safety technology, a time-based deferral policy is not scientifically sound, continues to effectively exclude many healthy gay and bisexual men, and does not meet the urgent demands of the moment. Further, with the increased uptake of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which reduces the likelihood that an HIV-negative individual will acquire HIV, many more gay and bisexual men are aware of their HIV-negative status and are taking steps to effectively eliminate their personal risk of HIV transmission. As such, it is imperative that we move away from discriminatory donor deferral policies that prohibit many healthy individuals from contributing much-needed blood and blood products.

In light of this shortage, we urge you to swiftly update blood donor deferral policies in favor of ones that are grounded in science, are based on individual risk factors, do not unfairly single out one group of individuals, and allow all healthy Americans to donate. We strongly encourage you to consider this critical solution as you work to develop a comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure that Americans have access to life-saving blood transfusions.

Thank you for your attention to this important issue.

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.

Black Press Media posted these files from the Associated Press at 5 p.m., Saturday, March 28.

Trump floats 2-week quarantine of NYC, Gov. Cuomo calls it ‘federal declaration of war’

WASHINGTON —President Donald Trump said Saturday that he may order an “enforceable quarantine” for New York City and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut —prompting surprise and shock from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

“This would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I’d rather not do it, but we may need it,” Trump said.

Cuomo likened such a quarantine to a “federal declaration of war” on the city and state. “It would be chaos and mayhem. … I don’t think it is plausible. I don’t think it is legal,” he said hours later on CNN.

Such an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. In China, a two-month lockdown in Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, began easing only on Saturday.

New York has roughly half of the nation’s confirmed cases.

“We’re looking at it and will be making a decision. A lot of the states that are infected — they’ve asked me if I’d look at it so we’re going to look at it,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a short flight to Norfolk, Va., for a visit to a Navy hospital ship headed to New York. “It would be for a short time.”

Cuomo’s immediate reaction: No thanks.

“I don’t like the sound of it,” he told reporters in Albany. “I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don’t know what you would be accomplishing.

France orders a billion protective masks

PARIS — France has ordered more than one billion protective masks, mainly from China, to try to make up for a shortage that is being felt in nations fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced.

But French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, noting tensions in world markets, suggested at a news conference that traffickers and black marketeers are now in the mask business, given the competition in procuring the vital necessity for health workers.

Veran said that an “air bridge” to China was being put in place, but “I will have the certitude (the masks arrived) … only the minute the planes are on the tarmac.” He said one major difficulty is that countries already hit by the virus remain vigilant that should the epidemic return they are equipped.

As of Saturday, France had 37,575 confirmed cases and 2,314 deaths — with 319 new deaths in the last 24 hours, health authorities said.

The prime minister warned the French that “the fight has just begun.”

Infant dies of COVID-19

CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death.

Officials didn’t release other information about the infant, who was from Cook County, which includes Chicago, including whether the child had other health issues.

The risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.

Children have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized.

Separate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill.

Italy: COVID-19 crisis an “appointment with history”

ROME — Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is hoping the European Union will put together a cohesive response to the plight of countries like his, whose economy has been crippled by the coronavirus outbreak.

Conte vowed to fight “to my very last drop of sweat” to prompt a “strong and cohesive European response.” Conte echoed an appeal the same evening by Spain, which is also reeling under a devastating COVID-19 outbreak.

Conte called the crisis “an appointment with history. Europe must say if it’s ready for this appointment” to effectively deal with social and economic shock wreaked by the pandemic.

Germany and the Netherlands are leading other EU nations in resisting calls for an issuance of joint European debt, colloquially dubbed “coronabonds.” Italian Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri expressed dismay that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in an interview described the bond idea as a “only a slogan.”

Crisis may delay Polish elections

WARSAW, Poland — Poland President Andrzej Duda says the May 10 date for the presidential election may not be realistic if the coronavirus spread continues and Poland remains under the current strict isolation regime for the citizens.

Duda’s words were the first sign from the ruling team that the elections may not be held as planned.

Earlier Saturday, the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party had the parliament approve changes to the electoral law to allow sick, quarantined and elderly people to vote remotely, in a clear preparation for May election.

Florida governor supports NYC quarantine

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump, tells reporters he had spoken with the president about the possibility of a coronavirus quarantine for the New York City area.

DeSantis says Florida will soon set up a checkpoint along Interstate 95 to screen travellers from that area, similar to one already in place along Interstate 10 to screen people from Louisiana. Many airports in Florida also are screening travellers from certain areas, requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days.

“I think whatever works is what we need to do,” DeSantis said. “We’re either fighting the virus or we’re not. The more people are being shuttled around the country, I just think it makes it more difficult. I think it would make it a lot easier if we didn’t have folks coming in from hot zones.”

Some South Carolina cities defy governor’s opposition to stay-at-home orders

COLUMBIA, S.C. — Leaders of several South Carolina cities say they are defying Gov. Henry McMaster’s opposition to stay-at-home orders and Attorney General Alan Wilson’s opinion that only McMaster can issue such measures.

In Folly Beach, where town officials had removed their checkpoint and had allowed vacation rentals to resume, the city council unanimously voted to re-establish the checkpoint and ban any new short-term rentals beginning Sunday.

Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin says on Twitter that his city’s stay-at-home order would take effect at 12:01 a.m. Sunday as scheduled. He says Wilson’s Friday opinion is “incorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis.”

Italy frees up $400 million euros for food coupons and food aid

ROME — Three weeks into national containment measures that have shut down most shops and non-essential industry, many Italians are hurting for food money during the lockdown amid the country’s devastating COVID-19 outbreak.

Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte told the nation he has signed a decree freeing up 400 million euros ($440 million) for food coupons and packages of food aid. Volunteers from Italy’s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.

Conte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: “People are suffering psychologically, they’re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.”

Conte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.

Germany: 12 die in nursing home

BERLIN — Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.

Authorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn’t shown symptoms of COVID-19.

Local officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.

Another nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.

Germany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.

First coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.

One person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.

There are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.

The Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.

Spain: Future of the EU is at stake

MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc’s southern flank.

“It’s Europe’s time to act. Europe is at risk,” Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.

Sanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.

He calls for a “new Marshall Plan” to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.

Italy and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.

Spain: Commuting ban starts Monday

MADRID — Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.

Sanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home “as if it were a weekend” to “intensify” efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.

Spain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.

Spain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.

New Orleans one of U.S.’s COVID-19 hot spots

NEW ORLEANS — New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.

The donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.

“Like many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,” New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.

New Orleans is one of the nation’s hot spots for coronavirus.

Italy’s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day

ROME — Italy’s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.

Civil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a one-day high in the country which has the world’s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus.

The day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day’s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of COVID-19 and days ago surpassed the total of China, where the outbreak began in early 2020.

The current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.

U.N. donates protective masks to NYC

UNITED NATIONS — U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the donation of 250,000 protective face masks, which had just been located in United Nations storage facilities, to the United States for use in hard-hit New York City.

The U.N. chief says: “These masks, in surplus to United Nations requirements, will be given to the medical professionals in New York City who have been working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives.”

Guterres says the United Nations and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office to ensure swift delivery of the masks to medical facilities around the city.

“On behalf of the U.N. community and the diplomatic corps, we sincerely hope this modest donation makes a difference,” Guterres said.

Illnesses in Detroit, a national hot spot for COVID-19, predicted to worsen next week

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to help the state address the COVID-19 pandemic.

The declaration announced by the White House on Saturday follows a back-and-forth between Trump and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has criticized the Trump administration for its slow response to the pandemic, saying “we cannot weather this alone.”

The U.S. surgeon general said Friday that Detroit, a national “hot spot” for cases of the new coronavirus, will worsen next week. More than 3,600 people in Michigan were confirmed to have COVID-19 Friday. At least 92 have died, most from the three counties in the Detroit area, according to state officials.

Trump floats 2-week quarantine of NYC, Gov. Cuomo calls it ‘federal declaration of war’

WASHINGTON —President Donald Trump said Saturday that he may order an “enforceable quarantine” for New York City and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut —prompting surprise and shock from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

“This would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I’d rather not do it, but we may need it,” Trump said.

Cuomo likened such a quarantine to a “federal declaration of war” on the city and state. “It would be chaos and mayhem. … I don’t think it is plausible. I don’t think it is legal,” he said hours later on CNN.

Such an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. In China, a two-month lockdown in Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, began easing only on Saturday.

New York has roughly half of the nation’s confirmed cases.

“We’re looking at it and will be making a decision. A lot of the states that are infected — they’ve asked me if I’d look at it so we’re going to look at it,” Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a short flight to Norfolk, Va., for a visit to a Navy hospital ship headed to New York. “It would be for a short time.”

Cuomo’s immediate reaction: No thanks.

“I don’t like the sound of it,” he told reporters in Albany. “I don’t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don’t know what you would be accomplishing.

France orders a billion protective masks

PARIS — France has ordered more than one billion protective masks, mainly from China, to try to make up for a shortage that is being felt in nations fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced.

But French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, noting tensions in world markets, suggested at a news conference that traffickers and black marketeers are now in the mask business, given the competition in procuring the vital necessity for health workers.

Veran said that an “air bridge” to China was being put in place, but “I will have the certitude (the masks arrived) … only the minute the planes are on the tarmac.” He said one major difficulty is that countries already hit by the virus remain vigilant that should the epidemic return they are equipped.

As of Saturday, France had 37,575 confirmed cases and 2,314 deaths — with 319 new deaths in the last 24 hours, health authorities said.

The prime minister warned the French that “the fight has just begun.”

Infant dies of COVID-19

CHICAGO — Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death.

Officials didn’t release other information about the infant, who was from Cook County, which includes Chicago, including whether the child had other health issues.

The risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.

Deerfield,IL,03-17-2020 12:11,https://patch.com/illinois/deerfield/deerfield-declares-state-emergency-response-coronavirus,Deerfield Declares State Of Emergency In Response To Coronavirus,"DEERFIELD, IL — Mayor Harriet Rosenthal declared a state of emergency Monday after the village board voted unanimously to grant her expanded disaster authorities in response to the new coronavirus. Rosenthal's initial orders under the emergency declaration provide for expanded purchasing authority, allow emergency police and public works staff scheduling and encourage coordination with other government agencies.

Rosenthal said the village was facing an extreme public health risk from the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. She said representatives of the Lake County Health Department informed village officials at least one resident had been infected.



""As has been experienced in other locales in the United States and around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to infect large number of people in a short amount of time, placing extreme burdens on the health care system and the economy,"" Rosenthal said. ""In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the village and to protect the residents of the village from this disease and death, I find that it is necessary to issue this declaration to implement emergency regulations and orders.""

On Saturday, the village announced a family member of a Deerfield High School student had tested positive for COVID-19. The student was reported to be asymptomatic.

There were six confirmed coronavirus cases in Lake County as of Monday afternoon, although public health officials had not found evidence any of them were caused by community transmission.

The mayor's new emergency powers include the authority to impose a curfew on some or all of the city, to order businesses or streets closed and to set the maximum prices of goods or services offered within the village. Violators may be fined. Trustees voted to extend the state of emergency until the adjournment of their next board meeting.

According to Village Attorney Steve Elrod, most Illinois municipalities have not incorporated the authority they have under the Illinois Municipal Code to issue local disaster declarations. At an emergency meeting over the weekend in Highland Park, Elrod said he would advise all his municipal clients to make such amendments.



In Deerfield, Village Hall is open Tuesday as an election day polling place but no in-person village services are available, according to staff. The Patty Turner Center and Deerspring Pool were set to remain open as polling places, but the voting site planned for Congregation B'Nai Tikvah was moved to Saint Gregory's Episcopal Church, the Lake County Clerk's Office announced Monday morning.



Non-emergency village staff are available to help residents by phone, email or appointment. No door-to-door solicitation permits are being issued. Payments and service requests can be processed online.

The Deerfield Police Department has suspended non-emergency services including fingerprinting, child safety seat inspections, disability parking placards, ride-alongs, tours and presentations.



After Gov. JB Pritzker's executive order shuttering dine-in restaurants, the Deerfield-Bannockburn-Riverwoods Chamber of Commerce provided a list of nearly a dozen Deerfield eateries offering delivery and curbside pick-up service during the mandatory closure.

Rosenthal said she would work with Village Manager Kent Street to provide a list later in the week of opportunities for volunteering and to meet community needs.

Also at the March 16 board meeting, trustees took action to allow for members of village board and commissions to conduct future meetings electronically.

Des Plaines,IL,03-04-2020 15:10,https://www.journal-topics.com/articles/des-plaines-emergency-management-keeps-eye-on-coronavirus/,Des Plaines Emergency Management Keeps Eye On Coronavirus,"As concerns about the coronavirus outbreak grow and more cases are reported in the U.S., including two this week in the Northwest suburbs, Des Plaines is preparing to keep local residents safe if a local outbreak occurs.

According to John Pluta, director of the Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency in Des Plaines, he has been meeting with city department heads regularly to discuss plans for management of the virus since the first case in the U.S. was reported in late December.

As of Sunday (March 1), 87,137 cases of novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, have been reported globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Overall, 43 cases have been reported in the U.S., both travel-related and person-to-person spread. Six deaths have been reported in Washington state as of Monday.

Coronavirus causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In severe cases, the infection can result in death.

The first local case of person-to-person spread of the virus was reported in January when a woman who had traveled to Wuhan, China, and her husband, both in their 60s, were diagnosed and treated at St. Alexius Hospital in Hoffman Estates. Both were released in February.

Another local case was diagnosed Saturday, Feb. 29 and requires confirmation by the CDC, according to the Illinois Dept. of Public Health (IDPH), as well as a fourth case on Monday (March 2). The patient diagnosed Saturday is a man in his 70s who is being treated at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights. His wife was diagnosed Monday and is being quarantined at home, said the IDPH. Both are in good condition.

People who may have come in contact with the couple, including two Arlington Heights Elementary School Dist. 25 employees and their children, are being monitored, said the department of public health and the district.

“We’re following our emergency operations plan,” said Pluta of Des Plaines’ preparations for a potential coronavirus outbreak.

Des Plaines’ Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency is accredited through the Illinois Emergency Management Act and follows Illinois Administrative Code guidelines for creating emergency operations plans to help communities recover from disasters.

Each emergency and disaster agency serving a specific political subdivision, such as Des Plaines, is required to have a plan that addresses public information, mass care for population, health and medical services, mortuary services and more by the time they are reviewed this September, according to the most recent version of the administrative code, updated in July 2018.

Pluta said the agency followed a similar plan during the H1N1 outbreak around a decade ago.

Currently, the city has about two dozen Emergency Management and Fire Corps volunteers, Pluta told the Journal & Topics. He said the volunteers respond to day-to-day emergencies and would not perform differently during a pandemic.

Until 2017, the city also had over 160 Medical Reserve Corps volunteers, though many resigned that year due to a dispute between volunteers and the city regarding paperwork and licenses. While that program is now on hold, Des Plaines is working to restructure and modernize the program with help from Holy Cross Hospital and Oakton Community College, said Police Chief William Kushner.

Bruce Ahlman, who helped coordinate Medical Reserve Corps and Citizen Corps volunteers until 2012, said the two groups helped purchase thousands of dollars in equipment that could help the city during an outbreak. Kushner said the city still has emergency supplies, though some supplies Ahlman said were purchased, such as N95 respirator masks, would have outlived their usefulness.

Approximately one month ago, the city ordered approximately 1,000 new N95 masks. However, they have yet to be delivered due to a high demand globally.

“It’s problematic,” Kushner said, adding that the masks — which require a testing process that will render about half the masks ordered obsolete — are also being sold for unusually high prices.

Masks should only be necessary for those who do not want to transmit the virus to others, Kushner said.

In the case of an outbreak, the police chief said the city would work to maintain “continuity of operations,” that is, to make sure the city keeps providing necessary services to residents. If a vaccine for coronavirus is developed, this would include distribution of the vaccine to key government employees, elected officials and their families, he said.

For now, Kushner said police are also monitoring the situation and are in contact with the IDPH and CDC on a daily basis. He urged local residents to maintain hygiene habits that could prevent the spread of the virus, such as hand washing, and avoiding public places when experiencing flu symptoms.",None,58193.0,42.0344,-87.9008
Evanston,IL,03-16-2020 09:16,https://patch.com/illinois/evanston/evanston-mayor-announces-state-emergency,Coronavirus: Evanston Mayor Announces State Of Emergency,"EVANSTON, IL — The City of Evanston is under a state of emergency, Mayor Steve Hagerty announced Sunday night. The mayor's message cites confirmed coronavirus cases in Evanston, alongside state and federal actions to reduce the spread of the virus, as the cause of the state of emergency.

Hagerty said the state of emergency is ""a proactive measure which will enhance our City's ability to respond to this infectious disease.""

The state of emergency means:

The opening of the city's Emergency Operations Center, allowing for greater coordination and management. It will be led by the mayor, acting city manager, Health and Human Services director, city emergency manager and the police and fire chiefs.

Hagerty has assembled a Coronavirus Task Force for the city with ""key members of the education, government, business, faith, nonprofit, health, and senior communities"" to disseminate information to their communities and to share their concerns.

A special City Council meeting is scheduled for Tuesday at 6 p.m. ""to take care of some time-sensitive City business ... Please watch from home.""

The mayor repeated the city's effort to ""flatten the curve"" to slow the spread of the virus by taking efforts like thorough hand washing and social distancing.



Since the mayor's last message, he said, several major events have taken place, listed below:

Two Evanston residents have been confirmed to have COVID-19. They are self-isolating and are being monitored by our Health and Human Services Department.

The Health and Human Services Department is conducting an investigation of all those who were in direct contact with the confirmed cases. These individuals are required to self-isolate and report to Health and Human Services on a daily basis.

Additional residents who have come into close contact with other non-Evanston COVID-19 exposures will also be required to self-isolate for 14 days.

On Friday, the President declared a national emergency.

This afternoon, Governor J.B. Pritzker announced the closure of all bars and restaurants statewide effective Monday, March 16, at close of business through Monday, March 30. (Restaurants will remain open for delivery, drive-through and pick-up orders.)

""In light of these developments and the growing threat to our community, I took the action today of formally declaring a local state of emergency,"" the mayor said.



Mayor Hagerty continued:

""I know this is an unusual, uncertain, and frightening time. Having spent my career helping communities prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters, I can say that the social fabric of Evanston is strong enough to withstand this threat if we all comply with the directives of CDC and IDPH; continue to organize, lend a hand and help one another (for we all will be impacted by this emergency, but not impacted equally); and understand that our community leaders and organizations will be pressed to make difficult decisions.",state_of_emergency,74756.0,42.0463,-87.6942

This action was not taken lightly, and I feel strongly I am doing what is best for the safety of our people. The recurring theme I have seen during my research into previous pandemics is “social distancing.” Keeping people apart is the most effective action a community can take to stop the spread of a virus. For that reason, I am postponing all city-hosted meetings and events until further notice. I strongly encourage individuals, groups and organizations planning events and meetings to postpone, reschedule or move to a virtual environment. We are working diligently to develop a work schedule that will not jeopardize the city’s obligation to provide core services.

No other details at the moment.

The state Health Department hasn’t updated its webpage with coronavirus stats today.

We can't resist without our readers!

But, coincidentally, state Rep. Denise Garner (D-Fayetteville) made public her letter to Gov. Asa Hutchinson calling for a shutdown of all but essential activities.

Governor,

It’s difficult to imagine the stress you’re under as you agonize over decisions having to be made for our state. And I know you’re hearing from many experts.

I’m writing these views from my experience as a nurse practitioner, owner of a restaurant that we’ve closed until safe, wife of a 65 y/o, cancer survivor MD/JD husband on the front lines here in Fayetteville, mom of one MD, MPH, MSHE son who’s at the epicenter of trying to lessen the curve in TN, and one out of a job because of the shutdowns.

I’m asking you to please, make decisions based on the assumption that we already have Covid-19 spread in our state.

Our pediatricians are telling us they have clinically diagnosed patients that were not a priority for testing.

We cannot depend on all of them to self-quarantine as advised. Many certainly spread the virus before showing symptoms & after suggested quarantine.

Conservative estimates suggest actual cases in each state are about 10 times the number of diagnosed, but researchers in Boston project it is upwards of 50 times the number of diagnosed.

We can see from China, Italy, Seattle, San Francisco, and New York where this is going.

Our health care system will be overrun in a matter of weeks, if not before.

Decisive action today will save lives.

There is also a strong economic case to make to take aggressive actions now. The longer we fail to act, the longer this continues. That will lead to more job loss, more closed businesses, more bankruptcies. It will not take a long-term view to see that waiting to act did not help local economies and small businesses.

These are our families, our friends, our communities at stake. I know this is weighing heavily.

You can save lives and mitigate the economic impact by aggressive, decisive action.

PLEASE DECLARE A STATE EMERGENCY.

Shut down non-essential services through executive action. Call in the National Guard to aid with logistics, field hospital setup, etc. Develop surge capacity for beds, equipment, and workforce through executive action and integration of the non-health sectors. Communicate roles and responsibilities to all levels of government, individuals, and the private sector.

This is a daunting task in front of us, but we are in this together.

Decisive action today can make all the difference.

Thank you,

Denise Garner

The declaration came after a 7-0 City Council vote to amend the city code to create a process for civil emergencies and was followed by another unanimous vote extending the state of emergency until the next council meeting.

""It will not go on indefinitely,"" Rotering said. ""We are scheduled to meet again April 6. But, within the resolution, there's also the opportunity to call a special meeting, as we have today. So we can call a special meeting in a week, we can call a special meeting in two days, whenever it's necessary to end these powers.""



Most local governments in the state have not incorporated authority granted by the Illinois Municipal Code to declare their own states of emergency, Corporation Counsel Steve Elrod explained. He said his firm Elrod Friedman encouraged all its municipal clients to put such provisions on their books.

""We are in interesting times and very fluid times, dealing with a state of emergency that has been called at the not only at the national level but at the state level,"" Elrod said. ""There are certain powers that have been codified into Illinois statute that would currently appear, without any further action by the City Council, [to] allow the mayor and the city manager ... to exercise certain extraordinary powers. Many of those powers have not been tested in the 150-year existence of the city of Highland Park, and in my opinion, ought to be confirmed by the corporate authorities.""

The initial orders were limited to a direction for city officials to coordinate with other public bodies in the state, implementing emergency staffing protocols for employees of the city's fire, police and public works departments, and executing emergency contracts. The ordinance and the emergency declaration allow for additional emergency regulations and orders.

Late Monday, Rotering issued a supplemental orders shuttering all health and recreational clubs and all motion picture and live performance theaters starting at the close of business Tuesday. The move followed an executive order issued earlier in the day by Gov. JB Pritkzer implementing a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more and shuttering dine-in restaurants and bars.

""It is difficult to order the closure of businesses within our community, however, theaters, health clubs, and recreational clubs naturally result in individuals interacting in close quarters. As we've seen worldwide, an effective method to combat COVID-19 is maintaining significant distances between people,"" Rotering said. ""After discussions with the City Council, City Manager and evaluating guidance provided by the CDC and Illinois Department of Public Health, it became clear that the closure of such facilities was necessary as we work to diminish the spread of COVID-19.""

City Manager Ghida Neukirch reminded the community that emergency services will remain available, even as municipal buildings close to the public.

""The general public is encouraged to take social distancing practices and adhere to public health recommendations for staying healthy,"" Neukirch said. ""Please know that your city is in close communication with our government partners in Highland Park, with state and federal agencies, with neighboring municipalities, Highland Park Hospital and, really, the entire community.""

In a statement at the March 14 emergency meeting, after declaring the state of emergency, Rotering urged residents to support one another and heed warnings from public health officials.

""This week has seen dramatic steps being taken to accelerate social distancing in an effort to slow down the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the anticipated challenges to our health care system. In recent days, our city has experienced the closure of all public access to city buildings except the police station, the senior center, the library, all schools, all park district facilities, Ravinia Festival, the art center and more. While these steps may seem extreme, they are advised by the careful guidance of the Illinois Department of Public Health, which urges all Illinois residents to reduce social contact as much as possible,"" she said.

""I cannot stress this enough: stay home. Let's do everything we can to minimize social contact and slow the spread of this virus. If your kids are home or coming home from college, please keep them at home. This is not a time for gatherings — for hanging at friends' houses.

Rotering said people with symptoms of the virus — fever, cough and shortness of breath — should contact their doctor to arrange for potential testing.

""This is not the city of Highland Park's area. I urge you, call Lake County Health,"" Rotering said. ""Anyone who is not feeling well should seek medical care without fear. Documentation status will not be checked before care is provided. It's critical that everybody get medical help if needed as quickly as possible.""

Rotering also asked the community to consider how to support the most vulnerable in the community. The mayor said the Moraine Township food pantry needs donations from the public at its office at 800 Central Ave. Goods can be dropped off weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. outside the office. Needed this week: oatmeal, canned fruit or fruit cups, cereal, crackers, tuna, mac & cheese, pasta, pasta sauce and paper bags with handles. The township also accepts donations. Call 847-432-3240 for more information.

""Please check on your neighbors. As we self-quarantine and socially distance ourselves, concerns about seniors and others becoming isolated are critically important, and while the city is offering well-being checks, we need everybody's help. Think about your neighborhood. Think about your network. Who's living alone? Who might get sick with nobody knowing? Who might run out of food or medication with no way to get help? Every one of us knows people who are elderly, or disabled or living alone or otherwise unable to get what they need during this crisis. Please, make a plan to check on them daily. It can be by phone, it can be by email, it can be by a door knock and then a few steps back from the door, if they're sick. Let's keep an eye on everybody. Nobody should be left alone during this crisis,"" she said. ""If we all, street by street, block by block, think of who needs to be checked on, we can keep all members of our community safe, and if that friend, or neighbor, or family member does not respond, please call the Highland Park police and they will check up on them. Together we can care for each other and pull through this time of challenge.""

Police Services – Police Department Lobby to remain open



The Police Lobby will remain open to the public for emergency situations. All non-emergency, not-in-progress crimes should be called in to the non-emergency number at 847-515-5311 to have the initial report taken via phone. For non-emergency situations, the dispatcher will take the required information and an officer will re-contact you as soon as possible via telephone to handle your call for service. Examples of non-emergency calls include but are not limited to: theft reports, damage to property, and fraud. Additionally, certain non-emergency issues can be reported using the new online police reporting program. Residents are encouraged to use this form of reporting these types of calls to help limit face-to-face interaction with the public on non-emergency calls. As a reminder, always call 911 in an emergency.

The Medication Drop Box located in the Police lobby will be closed until further notice. To find alternative locations for this service, please see the DEA location list. Earlier this week, Huntley Police Department (and many neighboring public safety agencies) made adjustments to their response procedures. Dispatchers have begun asking additional questions regarding symptoms of COVID-19. This allows the first responders to use proper precautions when caring for our community.

Police officers will continue to physically respond to all high-priority, emergency, exigent, in progress calls that effect life safety issues. Again, always call 911 in an emergency or if you are in danger.

Utility Bill Payments: At this time, we are asking the public to conduct business online as much as possible. Utility bill customers wishing to pay their bill in-person can use the drop box located in the front drive aisle of the Municipal Complex at 10987 Main Street. You can also call 847-515-5200 to make a payment over the phone using Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express. Requests for service may also be submitted online by navigating to the Finance Department home page on the Village website. The Village also offers an online payment option and automated bill payment pro gram. Should you have any questions or require any Village services, please contact us at 847-515-5200.

Building Permits and Inspections: Building permits are now being processed through email. Permit applications and accompanying plans can be sent to inspections@huntley.il.us. In some instances, file sizes may be too large and will need to be sent via Dropbox. You will receive an e-mail from the Development Services Department confirming receipt of the permit application within one business day. If you do not receive an email or if you have questions, please call 847-515-5252.

Inspections of occupied homes have been suspended until further notice to limit direct contact between employees and residents. Additional inspections may be suspended or delayed depending upon the current situation. The Village will make every effort to ensure timely inspections, but for the safety and of residents and inspectors, this may not always be possible.

Public Meetings: As Governor Pritzker has ordered, all public meetings will be limited to no more than 50 people. Please consider carefully whether or not to attend any meetings. Please use precautionary measures if you choose to attend a public meeting. Please stay home if you do not feel well. Village Board meetings are recorded and posted the following day for viewing on the Village's website. Please check the Village website at www.huntley.il.us to check the status of any regularly scheduled meetings.

Thank you for your understanding, and please do the following to help prevent the spread of COVID-19:

Wash your hands frequently

Avoid large gatherings

Stay home as much as possible

Keep social distance to at least 6 feet

Do not touch your face

Please be sure to check with your neighbors, especially those who are elderly or have mobility issues, to see if you can lend a helping hand in running errands or picking up groceries or other necessities.

Lake Bluff,IL,03-18-2020 23:00,https://patch.com/illinois/lakeforest/gyms-ordered-closed-lake-bluff-declares-coronavirus-emergency,Gyms Ordered Closed As Lake Bluff Declares Coronavirus Emergency,"LAKE BLUFF, IL — Village trustees voted unanimously via speakerphone at an emergency village board meeting Wednesday to amend the Lake Bluff municipal code to expand the definition of a civil emergency to include epidemics of infectious diseases.

Village President Kathy O'Hara then declared such an emergency in response to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. Trustees then extended the state of emergency until the end of the next village board meeting. O'Hara was the only elected official to attend the meeting in person.

""The Illinois Department of Public Health has now confirmed localized community person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in Illinois, significantly increasing the risk of exposure and infection to Illinois' general public, and creating an extreme public health risk in the village and throughout the state,"" O'Hara said, in the declaration.

As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, there were 22 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, among Lake County residents, according to the Lake County Health Department. The department learned of the first infected county resident a week earlier.

""As has been experienced in other locales in the United States and around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to infect large numbers of people in a short amount of time, placing extreme burdens on the health care system and the economy,"" O'Hara declared.

In her first set of emergency orders, O'Hara mandated the closure of all physical fitness facilities and membership sports and recreation clubs starting Thursday.

Zak Rivera, owner of Focused Results Personal Training, addressed the board before the vote. He explained the basis of his fitness business was one-on-one training and there was never more than eight people present at one time. Amid concerns over the coronavirus, he said about half of the sessions conducted by personal trainers at his facility have been conducted online and virtual.



""We've been diligent and we understand the severity of the issue, and we're just trying to operate our business as any small business owner would like to do, and also take care of our clients,"" Rivera said, asking the village president to allow him to stay open and offering to adhere to additional hygienic restrictions.

""We're trying to have our clients be safe as well as our trainers, but as our trainers — and obviously myself and my wife who own the space — are reliant on our doors to be open, or at least to be able to do virtual sessions,"" he said. ""In order to pay the trainers, for them to make a living, for us to make a living, it's pretty much imperative that we have that ability to be able to operate our business to some degree.""

O'Hara said she truly appreciated Rivera's concerns. Later in the meeting, a trustee asked the village president if an exception could be made for local small businesses to conduct one-on-one training.

""I am certainly not thrilled about having to do this declaration. But I am closing them all, and that is under my authority to do so,"" O'Hara said.



Despite the hardship for affected businesses and workers, O'Hara said the public's health and safety were the paramount concerns of village leaders.

""I truly believe that at this point in time we have to do this,"" O'Hara said. ""I am hoping that it will not be for a long duration, and I truly understand how this will affect a lot of local businesses and everything else — both locally and nationally.""

The declaration also authorized emergency purchasing and staffing measures for village employees in the police and public works departments, as needed, to protect health and safety.

The amendment to the village code and emergency declaration is essentially identical to similar such ordinances incorporated by other suburban municipal clients of Elrod Friedman, recently co-founded by Lake Bluff's village attorney. The changes define civil emergencies and extraordinary emergency authorities.



The Illinois Municipal Code grants local governments the power to declare their own states of emergency, and the firm encouraged all its municipal clients to update their codes to include the authority, according to co-founder Steve Elrod.

The order to close gyms in Lake Bluff follows the closures of Lake Bluff village, park district and library facilities to the public.

Gov. JB Pritzker issued a disaster declaration on March 9 and subsequent emergency orders that mandated the statewide closure of all public and private schools, a ban on gatherings of 50 or more people and a restriction on dine-in service at bars and restaurants.

In Highland Park, Mayor Nancy Rotering ordered all health clubs, movie theaters and live performance venues closed by the end of the day Tuesday after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend.

Lake Forest has closed all city playgrounds and all non-essential municipal buildings, and fire department officials have asked residents to limit calls to 911 to true medical emergencies, according to an announcement from city staff. Emergency personnel and public health officials requested that those experiencing only mild symptoms stay home and try to avoid infecting others.

Dr. Sana Ahmed, medical epidemiologist at the Lake County Health Department, asked those showing mild COVID-19 symptoms — fever, coughing, shortness of breath — to distance themselves from others in their household and using a separate bedroom and bathroom when possible. Call a doctor if the symptoms worsen.

""We are prioritizing testing for symptomatic people who have high risk of complications — older adults living in congregate settings and those with chronic health conditions like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, and those with weakened immune systems,"" Ahmed said in a release.

The moves are an effort to maximize social distancing practices, reduce the rate the coronavirus spreads in the general population and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, a public health intervention often referred to as ""flattening the curve.""

O'Hara was joined behind the dais by Village Administrator Drew Irvin and Village Attorney Peter Friedman at Wednesday afternoon's emergency meeting. They maintained a distance of at least six feet, as recommended by public health officials, to minimize the risks of transmitting the virus to one another.



""The most important message is that our residents need to stay home,"" O'Hara said in a release announcing the emergency declaration.

Trustees were able to vote over the phone thanks to an executive order by the governor. The next Lake Bluff Village Board meeting is tentatively set for April 13.

Oregon public health officials announced that seven more individuals are presumed infected with the novel coronavirus, including a person in Marion County. Gov. Kate Brown on Sunday declared a state of emergency as the total number of people reported to be infected doubled since Saturday.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown Sunday declared a state of emergency as officials detected seven new cases of the novel coronavirus, including the first known case in Marion County.

Five new cases were reported in Washington County, where a school employee was diagnosed with the disease at the start of Oregon’s outbreak, and one case in Douglas County.

The announcement of the new cases brings to 14 the known presumed cases of people infected with COVID-19.

“Today’s news is both troubling and expected,” said Pat Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority. “We know we will see more cases.”

Authorities were releasing few details about the new patients, but said the person ill in Marion County contracted the disease through community spread, not from foreign travel or contact another person known to be infected.

“I am declaring a state of emergency,” Brown said in a Sunday news conference with health officials.

DOCUMENT: Governor's declaration of emergency

The governor’s declaration is intended to free up more state resources to combat the spread of the disease. That includes activating a corps of retired medical professionals to help, including in conducting trace investigations to identify anyone who has had contact with those diagnosed as infected.

Allen urged Oregonians to take the outbreak seriously and to not stigmatize those who are infected or under monitoring.

“We cannot combat COVID-19 if we turn on each other,” Allen said.

Sign up for newsletter

The city of Marseilles declared a local ""state of emergency,"" which Mayor Jim Hollenbeck said was the first step for getting reimbursements from the federal government should they do so in the future.

Hollenbeck said Wednesday night he's been given additional powers as a result but said it's only to allow himself to make a decision quickly if needed in the coming weeks as a result of the coronavirus outbreak.

He said he won't be using them for anything beyond that, such as take anyone's guns away.

""For me, to use the extras power for something not related to the virus would be an abuse of power,"" Hollenbeck said to The Times following the meeting. ""If I make any decisions, it'll be strictly virus-related.""

Until then, he's hoping things remain ""status quo"" and that no further businesses are asked to temporarily close, which would further reduce the amount the city collects in sales tax.

""And I'm hoping our bars and restaurants aren't closed too long because they're small-business people,"" Hollenbeck said.

The city also isn't pulling in any money from gambling machines, which the state of Illinois also has banned for the time being.

""It's just not a good situation, so I'm hoping it starts to level off,"" he said.

City buildings closed, 3 ways to pay water bill

All Marseilles city buildings will be closed to the public, with the exception of police, fire and ambulance, which will be for emergency access only.

Additionally, all city parks are closed.

Water bill payments should be made in one of the three following ways:

• Online through the PSN Payment System. This can be accessed through the city website at www.cityofmarseilles.com, or through the App Store or Google Play. You can call 1-877-885-7968 for PSN payments also.

• Mail your payment to: City of Marseilles, 209 Lincoln St., Marseilles, IL 61341.

• Utilize the payment drop box at City Hall located on the outside of the building next to the door.

Water meter replacements will be suspended until further notice. Public utility staff will be prohibited from entering private homes, as well as building inspections, unless during an emergency.

Fire, ambulance and police services will not be interrupted. Protection guidelines and practices have been implemented for these services.

City staff will continue to be available via email and telephone at 815-795-2133 to address any concerns during normal business hours of 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. Refer to www.cityofmarseilles.com for contact information and forms.

Following the regular council meeting Wednesday, all upcoming scheduled meetings are cancelled.

""We are working on establishing a conference call system to allow commissions to meet remotely,"" said Mayor Jim Hollenbeck in a press statement.

Administrative adjudication is cancelled until further notice.

Restaurants and bars that serve food may not have any dine-in customers; however, restaurants may have curbside pickup or drive-through service along with delivery services. Carry outs are also permitted under the order as long as the space is large enough so individuals can still maintain social distancing. This would be the situations where someone makes an online order or telephone order and comes at a specific time when their food is done and picks it up.

Pritzker responds to a question after announcing that three more people have died in the state from from Covid-19 virus, two Illinois residents and one woman visiting from Florida, during a news conference Thursday, March 19, 2020, in Chicago. AP Photo

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered all state residents to remain in their homes except for essentials, joining similar dramatic efforts in California and New York to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Pritzker's order, which takes effect Saturday at 5 p.m. and is set to expire April 7, still allows the state's 12.6 million residents to head outside to buy groceries and medicine.

“If there are actions that I can take that will save lives in the midst of this pandemic, no matter how difficult, then I have an obligation,” Pritzker said. The Democrat said he was trying to prevent “potentially tens of thousands” of deaths but urged people not to panic.

“For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much,” he said, adding that people can continue to shop for groceries and visit pharmacies, gas stations and banks. Residents also can continue to pick up meals from restaurants and exercise outdoors, he said.

Pritzker acknowledged that the state doesn't have the resources or “the desire” to broadly enforce the order, but he said law enforcement will take action if necessary in individual cases. The order exempts people who work in many essential industries, including health care, manufacturing, transportation and food production or sales, including at grocery stores and restaurants.

The stay-at-home order will also mean schools statewide remain closed until April 8, he said.

Pritzker had previously ordered all schools statewide to shut down through the end of March and limited gatherings to 50 people to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the state. He also closed dine-in service at bars and restaurants, but allowed businesses to continue delivery or carryout options.

The governors of California and New York have issued similar orders.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who stood by Pritzker's side as he announced the order, said she agreed with the decision.

“Think of this as safer at home,” she said.

For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild cases recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe ones can take three to six weeks to get better.

As of Friday afternoon, Illinois has reported 585 cases of COVID-19 in 25 counties, up from 422 a day earlier. The state reported one more death Friday — a woman in her 70s from Cook County — taking the state's toll to five.

Sunday afternoon the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced the closures of all Illinois state parks and recreational areas owned by the IDNS, effective immediately until further notice because of the current Coronavirus pandemic that has swept across the United States and all over the world.

In a statement made on the IDNS Facebook page, all activities scheduled for IDNS properties have also been cancelled.

All scheduled events on state property are effectively cancelled; patrons are encouraged to call IDNR's Parks administrative line Monday through Friday at 217-782-6752 with questions.""

Earlier in the day, Governor J.B. Pritzker ordered all bars and restaurants to be closed to dine-in services effective at the start of business on Tuesday, which will coincide with the same period as all statewide public and private schools that will be closed until March 31, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, drive-through, delivery and carry-out service will continue during the time period. The Illinois Gaming Board also ordered the closing of all state casinos, including the Argos Casino in Alton and the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, effective from March 16-29, with reopening scheduled for March 30.

In updated statistics from the Illinois Department of Public Health, there are now 93 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including the first two confirmed in the Metro-East area, a woman in her 60s and a woman in her 70s from St. Clair County. There has yet to be a confirmed case in Madison County.

It was also announced all social gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned until further notice in the City of St. Louis, St. Louis County and St. Charles County in Missouri and both Madison County and St. Clair County in Illinois. All City public and St. Louis Catholic schools have also been closed, effective Wednesday until Apr. 3. It has also been recommended that all schools in the immediate St. Louis metropolitan area close no later than Wednesday, with all extracurricular activities, including sports, being cancelled.

Niles Mayor Andrew Przybylo issued an emergency declaration Sunday, March 15 related to the COVID-19 coronavirus, with a special village board meeting scheduled for 5:45 p.m. Tuesday, March 17.

At the meeting, village trustees are expected to discuss, “approval of an ordinance declaring an emergency affecting the public health, safety and welfare due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus.”

Although the meeting is open to the public, village officials are encouraging people not to attend the meeting in person, but to view it in other ways.

“The village is encouraging social distancing and invites the public to watch the broadcast (and/or rebroadcast) of the meeting rather than attend the meeting in person, in order to help ensure the health and safety of our residents, staff and elected officials,” a village statement read.

The meeting will be aired on the village’s local cable access channel and streamed through the village’s website live and on-demand after the meeting.

The disaster declaration is a preliminary step, which could free up funds for federal disaster assistance at a later date if needed, village spokesman Mitch Johnson said.

The village has canceled all other public meetings, closed the senior center and fitness center.

Niles Family Services, has limited services available on an appointment-only basis, including the food pantry 24-hour crisis line. Family services officials are making a plea to the public for donations of non-perishable food items for the pantry as a spike in demand is expected.

The village has a working group of department heads led by Niles Fire Chief Marty Feld coordinating the village’s response and planning for contingencies.

Niles police have ordered part-time, non-essential personnel to stay home and, although the police department remains open, are encouraging police reports for non-time sensitive or more minor incidents to be made over the phone or online.

Niles Police Sgt. Tony Scipione said police are scaling back responses to non-critical calls such as vehicle lockouts and are contacting nursing homes proactively via phone first to assess responses to calls rather than sending officers directly in person to nursing homes, to limit exposure to the extent possible.

The World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global pandemic March 11. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker declared a state disaster March 9 and has since ordered all schools, restaurants and bars closed for in-dining service through March 30. Pritzker banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people and advised against gatherings of 250 people or more.

The order came hours after announcing the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Oak Park. Two doctors at Rush Oak Park Hospital have since tested positive for coronavirus.

In its statement, Oak Park assured the public the order isn’t a travel ban, and police officers won’t stop drivers at its borders. Rather, according the village, the order was intended to “focus attention on the importance of social distancing.”

Residents are also free to go on walks.

The clarification shows the lockdown is nothing more than what is already being implemented in Chicago. The village won’t require any kind of “work pass” or village documentations for people traveling to and from work.

Residents are urged to stay home, but businesses providing “essential services” are exempt, according to the village.

That includes “grocery stores, banks, convenience stores, pharmacies, restaurants for delivery and pick up only, laundromats, skilled trades essential to maintaining the safety and sanitation of residences, hardware stores, medical service providers, first responders, transportation providers, government activities and essential social service providers and shelters,” officials said.

Mayor Anan Abu-Taleb declared a local state of emergency and Public Health Director Mike Charley issued the public order requiring residents to shelter in place beginning Friday through April 3, the village had announced Wednesday evening.

Earlier Wednesday, Oak Park officials said a man in his 30s was the village’s first confirmed case of the virus. He was recovering in isolation at home.

“The Oak Park Department of Public Health is working closely with officials from the Illinois Department of Public Health, investigating and notifying anyone who may have had exposure to the individual who tested positive for COVID-19,” officials said.

Violating the order will be treated as a violation of the Illinois Public Health Act, a Class A misdemeanor, according to a copy of the order obtained from the village.

The village’s website crashed in the minutes after the order was issued.

Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has pleaded with residents to stay home but thus far stopped short of a statewide lockdown, announced Thursday that 422 people in Illinois are so far confirmed COVID-19 patients. Four people have died.

The tally is expected to grow exponentially in the weeks ahead with expanded testing.

Thank you to everyone who has reached out regarding the shelter-in-place order issued Wednesday by the #OakPark Department of Public Health.

Plainfield,IL,03-23-2020 19:38,https://patch.com/illinois/plainfield/plainfield-mayor-renews-emergency-declaration-coronavirus,Plainfield Mayor Renews Emergency Declaration For Coronavirus,"PLAINFIELD, IL — Last Monday, March 16, Plainfield Mayor Michael Collins issued a State of Emergency declaration for the village as the new coronavirus began spreading into Will County. The length of such declarations can vary, and in last week's case it was deemed necessary to last seven days. Now that those seven days have expired, village staff told Patch that the declaration is being renewed.

While saying that there are ""no new circumstances"" in Plainfield's current situation, village Community Relations Director Amy De Boni added that, ""the disaster declaration will continue to be renewed throughout the ongoing COVID-19 situation.""



This means that until such time as it is deemed no longer necessary, the emergency declaration will continue to be renewed every Monday.

Declarations of a State of Emergency allow municipalities like Plainfield to receive disaster-relief funds from FEMA should that become necessary, and to change certain protocols regarding how the village government operates. In this case, declaring an emergency allows the village to activate its emergency operations plan. According to Village Administrator Brian Murphy, this plan has multiple tiers related to the spread of coronavirus, with different actions to be taken as more cases of the virus appear in proximity to Plainfield. As of Monday afternoon, a total of 26 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Will County and four cases had been confirmed in Kendall County.

""As this virus finds its way through the Chicagoland area... we have differing levels of action plans,"" Murphy said last Monday. ""They run from it being just a federal and state issue - we know it's that already. As of this afternoon it has moved into being a regional issue... The next two levels are when there cases that make it into Plainfield and then finally... if we have cases within the [village government] itself.""



At present, the most drastic step the village has taken in its plans is to close all municipal facilities to the public. This step complements the 'stay at home' executive order handed down by Governor J.B. Pritzker on Saturday, asking all Illinoisans to stay home except for essential tasks. Murphy also said the next Plainfield village board meeting will likely make use of digital and teleconference technology, to limit the amount of time board trustees and meeting attendees spend together physically.

""It will be live, it may be streaming only on cable,"" Murphy said. ""It may be that we just have a conference call right here in [Village Hall] and people can listen in.""

Raleigh,IL,,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/article241169916.html,Illinois governor orders schools closed due to coronavirus | Raleigh News & Observer,"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, along with elected and health officials give their daily update to Novel Coronavirus in Illinois, Friday, March 13, 2020. Tyler LaRiviere

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered the closing of every school in the state until March 30 starting Tuesday amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus.

Other states and large cities shut down schools this week over COVID-19 concerns, but officials in Illinois and Chicago resisted until Friday. Pritzker announced his decision in Chicago where more than 355,000 public school students will be affected. Statewide, nearly 2 million students will not be returning to the classroom.

Pritzker acknowledged that the decision will deeply affect students who receive meals at school and parents or family members who are unable to work from home. The Democrat, who has been particularly critical of the federal government's response to the spread of COVID-19 cases, said he still believes closing schools is necessary to limit the virus' spread.

“None of the choices that we have had to make over the last week have been easy or simple,” Pritzker said. “All of these choices have cascading effects.”

Illinois officials on Friday also reported 14 additional cases of people who had tested positive for the virus, bringing the state's total number of COVID-19 cases to 46. State officials are focused on trying to limit transmission in Illinois and hope that broader actions will help, said Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike.

“We would rather be overcautious than put the health of our most vulnerable citizens at risk,"" Ezike said.

A day earlier, Pritzker mandated the cancellation of events of more than 1,000 people and encouraged organizers of events with at least 250 attendees to cancel on their own.

“Having the general public stay home one day at a time will have a massive effect on bending this curve,” he said on Friday. ""And that means lives saved.""

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

The school cancellations are the latest blow to Chicago families, where students were kept out of classes earlier in the school year by an 11-day strike by the district’s more than 21,000 teachers. About 70% of the district's students are eligible for meals at school based on their families' incomes, making them particularly vulnerable to disruptions.

Chicago Public Schools Chief Executive Janice Jackson told reporters Friday evening that all district schools and offices will be closed Tuesday for everyone with the exception of essential personnel.

“The district will be providing meals to all of our students and families,” Jackson said. “All of our CPS locations will be food distribution centers beginning on Tuesday, March 17 at 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. every single day throughout the closure. Families will be able to pick up three days’ worth of food at any given time for each child that lives in their household.”

Learning packets for students will be available Monday.

Full-time and regularly scheduled district staff will be paid throughout the closure, Jackson said. Most central office staff will be asked to work remotely.

Pritzker said state officials are working to plan food delivery to students' homes or to neighborhood facilities around the state. He also said the state has granted access to unemployment benefits to people unemployed due to concerns about the coronavirus.

State Supt. Carmen Ayala encouraged school districts to provide activities that students can do at home but said administrators for each district have “full autonomy” to make their own decisions.

The closing of K-12 schools comes the same week that many large universities in Illinois suspended in-person classes due to concerns about the virus, including the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois, DePaul, Northwestern and Illinois State universities.

On Thursday, the Illinois High School Association limited attendance at the remaining games in this year’s 2020 boys basketball tournament and other sporting events.

Dozens of school districts and schools had canceled on their own earlier in the day, including the Archdiocese of Chicago.

“In light of (Pritzker's order) the best place for our students to be is at home,” said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who also appealed Friday to the city’s business community to work with — and be flexible with — employees who are parents of students.

“These are not ordinary times and we need employers to be in partnership with their employees,” Lightfoot said.

Under new workforce policies, city workers impacted by COVID-19 will be given additional paid time off and permitted to work from home when possible, she added.

“No parent should be forced to pick between staying home with a child and earning a paycheck,” Lightfoot said.

In addition to schools, other closures announced Friday in Illinois include casinos. Starting Monday, the state's 10 casinos must suspend gaming operations for 14 days, according to the Illinois Gaming Board.

This story has been corrected to show that the Archdiocese of Chicago is closing 170 schools with 51,000 students, not 205 schools with 71,000 students.

The Oak Park Village Board will vote Friday morning in a special meeting to expand the powers of its public health department director to respond to worries about the growing coronavirus threat.

Under the plan, Mike Charley, the longtime health department director, will have expanded authority, ranging from decisions on closing facilities, limiting the size of public gatherings to more mundane virus-mitigation actions, such as ordering supplies or equipment that would typically require village board approval.

""These are extraordinary times. We want to cut the red tape and empower our staff to make decisions,"" said Mayor Anan Abu-Taleb on Wednesday afternoon. ""We want to assure the public that we will always be forthcoming with any information we have and that we are taking this seriously.""

Abu-Taleb said that as of March 11, there were no known cases of infection in Oak Park.

""We are taking proactive actions,"" he said.

Cara Pavlicek, Oak Park village manager, said Tuesday that village government has been making internal policy changes since last week. Those range, she said, from following CDC protocol for cleaning voting machines in use during early voting at village hall, 123 Madison St., to placing quarantine restrictions on any employee who might be returning from a Level 3 country or any employee who might be returning from a cruise.

Additionally, village hall has suspended any employee travel through April 1. Village hall has also guaranteed that no employee will lose wages if they become sick with the virus and run out of sick leave.

Oak Park, said Abu-Taleb, is one of five municipalities in Cook County with its own public health department.

""This is a procedural step to allow Mike [Charley] to make decisions as he sees fit,"" said Abu-Taleb.

Pavlicek said the village board has the authority to rescind decisions it might disagree with.

Abu-Taleb said the village is in frequent communication with all local taxing bodies and will confer on all major decisions. But, he said, ""public safety issues tilt toward village hall.""

The expansion of health department authority had been expected to be approved at a village board meeting on Monday, March 16. The decision was made Wednesday to move more quickly and set a special meeting for Friday.

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown Sunday declared a state of emergency as officials detected seven new cases of the novel coronavirus, including the first known case in Marion County.

Five new cases were reported in Washington County, where a school employee was diagnosed with the disease at the start of Oregon’s outbreak, and one case in Douglas County.

The announcement of the new cases brings to 14 the known presumed cases of people infected with COVID-19.

“Today’s news is both troubling and expected,” said Pat Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority. “We know we will see more cases.”

Authorities were releasing few details about the new patients, but said the person ill in Marion County contracted the disease through community spread, not from foreign travel or contact another person known to be infected.

“I am declaring a state of emergency,” Brown said in a Sunday news conference with health officials.

DOCUMENT: Governor's declaration of emergency

The governor’s declaration is intended to free up more state resources to combat the spread of the disease. That includes activating a corps of retired medical professionals to help, including in conducting trace investigations to identify anyone who has had contact with those diagnosed as infected.

Allen urged Oregonians to take the outbreak seriously and to not stigmatize those who are infected or under monitoring.

“We cannot combat COVID-19 if we turn on each other,” Allen said.

(WTVO) — Officials from the Winnebago County Health Department said there were no additional cases of COVID-19 in the county, but 59 percent of test results are currently pending.

The county currently has 8 confirmed cases of coronavirus.

Director Dr. Sandra Martell said the county has 892 potential hospital beds available, but if the county is unable to mitigate the spread of coronavirus within 6 months, and 60 percent of the population of the county becomes sick, the healthcare system would need over 1,844 hospital beds.

Conversely, if residents follow Gov. JB Pritzker’s stay at home order, and only 20 percent of the population becomes infected, only 615 beds will be needed.

Rockford Mayor Tom McNamara said Winnebago County is fortunate to be behind the curve in its rate of infections, and said the local government is taking this time to prepare.

The Illinois Department of Public Health, announced 673 new cases statewide, more than double the 330 announced Wednesday.

IDPH Director Dr. Ngozi Ezeike also announced 7 deaths Thursday, for a total of 26 total dead. The deaths announced today include a man in his 50s, two men and two women in their 60s, a man in his 70s, and a woman in her 90s.

Currently, IDPH is reporting a total of 2,538 cases, including 26 deaths, in 37 counties in Illinois.

Mayor Gina Cunningham said in a statement that the declaration will help ""establish the legal authority for prompt resource mobilization, and establish the processes required for any possible federal or state disaster relief funds for [the] community.""

Cunningham called the declaration ""mainly procedural"" for the purpose of allowing Woodridge to coordinate ""more effectively"" with state and federal authorities. The declaration will also allow the village to enact emergency staffing protocols and to participate in contracts to buy emergency goods and services if needed.

The state of emergency is effective until March 24. After that, Woodridge may consider extending the original deadline.

DuPage County declared a state of disaster Monday after a nursing home patient in Willowbrook was confirmed to have the coronavirus. As of Thursday morning, 46 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed at the nursing home.

As fears over coronavirus lead to restaurant closures and increased social distancing, the DuPage County Courthouse has suspended all criminal and civil cases through April 17. Weddings and civil ceremonies have been rescheduled through April 24.

Updated Sunday, March 15 at 11:40 a.m.

The Alexandria Dept. of Health Sunday morning announced that a second Alexandria resident has been diagnosed with COVID-19, the illness associated with the novel coronavirus.

The resident had attended a conference in the District where an individual was later confirmed to have coronavirus. The second individual immediately traveled abroad, where they began to feel ill.

""As a result, the resident self-quarantined at home immediately upon return to Alexandria on March 6, and received regular monitoring from AHD. The resident was evaluated, tested and released from Inova Alexandria Hospital and is doing well at home. They will remain under self-isolation and be monitored by AHD until it is safe for them to return to their normal activities,"" according to a health department release.

City officials still believe the risk to the public is low.

Original story posted Saturday, March 14 at 7:44 p.m.

Some Alexandrians are quite concerned about coronavirus and others not concerned at all, but Alexandria’s City Manager Mark Jinks declared a local emergency Saturday morning. Doing so unlocks potential access to federal and state funds as the City of Alexandria implements its pandemic response plan.

Mayor Justin Wilson told residents on Facebook that City officials ""will be working to define options to assist businesses and residents over the next few days.""

Alexandria officials said the overall risk level remains low, as the City is not aware of current community transmission of the coronavirus COVID-19.

Just a few hours later, the Virginia Dept. of Health announced that a man in his 70s, who caught the virus from an unknown source, died of respiratory failure. He was being treated in the Newport News region of Virginia, about 150 miles southeast of Alexandria.

Area shopping centers will close at 7 p.m. Wednesday through March 29 and include the Brea Mall; Camarillo Premium Outlets; Carlsbad Premium Outlets; Del Amo Fashion Center, Torrance; Desert Hills Premium Outlets, Cabazon; Ontario Mills; The Outlets at Orange; The Shops at Mission Viejo; Fashion Valley, San Diego; Las Americas Premium Outlets, San Diego.

Simon, whose U.S. malls generate $60 billion in sales annually, owns 204 retail properties in 37 states.

Simon Property Group in a statement said it made the decision to close its malls after discussions with federal, state and local officials and “in recognition of the need to address the spread of COVID-19.”

“The health and safety of our shoppers, retailers and employees is of paramount importance and we are taking this step to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities,” said David Simon, chairman, CEO and president of Simon.

Simon’s decision comes two days after South Coast Plaza, owned by the Segerstrom family, opted to close the massive luxury mall in Costa Mesa. The closure came as mall operators learned a store employee at the Christian Louboutin boutique had tested positive for the coronavirus.

Mall operator Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield also said it is shutting down all of its U.S. malls, including centers in Canoga Park and Sherman Oaks. The centers will be closed Thursday, March 19, through Sunday, March 29, or until otherwise instructed by health authorities, according to the Paris-based mall giant.

In response to the COVID-19 containment, J.C. Penney Co. also announced Wednesday it was temporarily closing its stores and business offices, effective at 7 p.m. local time. The stores and offices are scheduled to reopen April 2.

Fashion giant Nordstrom said on Tuesday it will close more than 360 stores temporarily to stem the outbreak. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s also joined a growing list of retailers saying they would close their shops until the end of March. Apple, Nike and Allbirds had already shut down their stores.

Discount retailer Target, however, has lobbied to stay open saying shoppers need many of its products. Many governments have limited store openings to only merchants selling “essential” items.

The retail shutdown will have broad economic effects. UCLA economists say the nation’s already in a recession, a downturn that will hit California hard. And the loss of sales tax revenues is forcing many California cities to rethink their spending plans.

Anderson Independent Mail

Anderson County Council members approved a coronavirus emergency order during a brief but chaotic teleconference Thursday morning.

More than 300 people called in to the meeting, said Mark Williamson, the county's chief information officer.

The cacophony of noise on the line quickly frustrated County Council Chairman Tommy Dunn.

""Would everyone please be quiet and hold the noise down. Be quiet!"" Dunn pleaded while speaking into a cellphone. He was sitting in a conference room at the historic Anderson County Courthouse with Councilwoman Cindy Wilson and eight county staff members.

Dunn said the ordinance that was approved Thursday ""is to make it official that we're declaring a state of emergency for Anderson County due to coronavirus.""

""What this is going to do is to help us get reimbursed — some money back from the state and federal people that we're spending, taxpayers' money,"" Dunn said.

""We're not ordering any shelter-in-place. That will only be done by the governor and the federal folks,"" he said. ""We're not trying to take anyone's guns. We're just trying to protect our citizens and our economy.""

Dunn had difficulty hearing council members vote on the phone. But he and Wilson and at least two members on the phone did vote for the measure, creating the majority needed for it to pass. It did not appear than any council members voted against the ordinance.

Dun adjourned the meeting about seven minutes after it started.

""Not doing that again,"" Dunn said with a sigh. ""Unbelievable.""

County Administrator Rusty Burns said earlier this week that he does not intend to schedule any additional council meetings until social-distancing rules intended to slow the spread of COVID-19 are lifted.

Travis Air Force Base in California said in a tweet Sunday evening that an airman at the base, as well as the dependent of a service member, have tested positive for COVID-19.

And Air Mobility Command said that its headquarters at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois are implementing telework, staggered shifts and other steps to reduce personnel’s exposure to the virus while still getting the job done.

The announcements are some of the latest examples of how the coronavirus pandemic is prompting bases to take steps to mitigate its spread.

Declaring a public health emergency, as Andrews did at 10 a.m. Monday, allows Col. Andrew Purath, commander of the base and the 11th Wing, to take preventive steps to limit the virus’s spread, including restricting base movement and limiting services. Purath can end the emergency at any time, or extend it if necessary, Andrews said in a release.

“Declaring a public health emergency on Joint Base Andrews allows us a proactive approach to protect the safety and health of our airmen and the surrounding community,” Purath said. “Our top priority remains mitigating the effects and potential spread of this coronavirus.”

On Tuesday morning, Purath and Chief Master Sgt. Thomas Daniels will live stream a question and answer session on Facebook to address the community’s concerns about COVID-19.

Air Force details how coronavirus travel restrictions will affect airmen The movement restrictions cover all types of official travel, including permanent changes of station, temporary duty, and government-funded leave.

AMC said there are now no COVID-19 cases at Scott, but the schedule shifts are precautionary measures that will stay in place until the risk is lessened.

“My top priority is the protection and welfare of our airmen, employees and their families,” Gen. Maryanne Miller, AMC’s commander, said in Monday’s release. “Through these measures, we will limit physical interaction among our headquarters workforce to mitigate the risk of exposure and spread of this highly communicable virus.”

Travis said that the airman and the dependent who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are now in isolation at their respective homes off-base, and county public health officials have been notified.

“We are coordinating closely with our Team Travis and local county medical professionals to provide important care to the airman and family member,” Col. Jeffrey Nelson, commander of Travis’ 60th Air Mobility Wing, said in a tweet. “My leadership team and I are committed to the continued safety of our entire community and actively engaged and monitoring this evolving situation. We will continue working together with on- and off-base health care agencies to mitigate the effects of this virus and provide pertinent updates as timely as possible.”

Military health professionals at Travis are now tracing who came into contact with the airman and dependentn to find out if anyone else has been in close contact with them and may have been exposed.

The Air Force said last week that an airman at Altus Air Force Base in Oklahoma tested positive for coronavirus, in what is believed to be the first known case of an airman contracting COVID-19.

The Air Force also said in an email Monday that an active-duty airman at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia had a presumptive positive COVID-19 test — meaning that the person tested positive in a local test and is awaiting confirmation from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab — and is now undergoing evaluation and treatment.

Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Alabama also has a civilian employee who has been confirmed to have COVID-19 and is now undergoing evaluation and treatment, the Air Force said.

The Air Force has authorized its personnel who work at the Pentagon to telework, when their mission allows, to spread the workforce out during the outbreak.

The declarations came two days after the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control announced that three people in Beaufort County had tested positive for the virus and were in isolation.

DHEC said two of the people “are close contacts of each other and had known exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19 from another state.” The third person “has no known connection to any other case and recently traveled internationally.”

DHEC representatives did not immediately respond to requests for updates on the cases Monday.

The Beaufort County state of emergency, approved unanimously Monday by County Council, allows county administrator Ashley Jacobs the authority to “take any necessary actions for protections of the health, safety and welfare of Beaufort County citizens,” according to the ordinance.

The actions noted in the ordinance are:

• Utilize all available resources of county and municipal government as reasonably necessary to cope with the COVID-19 emergency.

• Transfer the direction, personnel or functions of county departments, agencies, etc., as needed for purposes of facilitating or performing emergency services.

• Contract, requisition and compensate for goods and services from private sources.

• Prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuations or relocations.

• Suspend or limit nonemergency activities and prohibit public assemblies,

Jacobs said Monday that county funds used under the declaration are eligible for state recompensation.

The state of emergency is in place until May 16.

Bluffton introduced its COVID-19 Operations Plan on Monday. A news release said its primary goal is to “minimize exposure between Town of Bluffton staff and the public.”

As of Monday, the town will remain open with reduced staff and functions. All public meetings are canceled, as is Bluffton Municipal Court. All municipal court cases scheduled for March 24 will be rescheduled.

The town is encouraging the public to use electronic payment methods. Business licenses can be renewed and accommodations tax and hospitality tax payments can be made on the town’s website: www.townofbluffton.sc.gov. The public can email forms, questions and applications to BusinessLicense@townofbluffton.com. Questions concerning payments can also be directed to 843-706-4501.

Town parks will remain open but public restrooms may be closed for cleaning and based on town staff resources.

News and updates can be found on the town’s Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages.

The public can be added to the town’s distribution list and receive all of its media releases and meeting notices. Sign up through the town website or email public information officer Debbie Szpanka at dszpanka@townofbluffton.com and ask to be added to the mailing list.

The lead agency in the state during a public health emergency is DHEC, which works closely with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coronavirus updates, news and guidelines on the disease can be found at scdhec.gov and cdc.gov.

According to DHEC, there were 33 confirmed cases of the virus in the state as of Monday, compared to 29 on Sunday and 13 on Friday. One of the cases resulted in the state’s first coronavirus-caused death, an elderly person in Lexington County.

“We emphasize the importance of practicing disease prevention measures and following recommendations for social distancing to protect our community as a whole,” Dr. Brannon Traxler, a DHEC physician consultant, said in a news release.

The release said people with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath should call their healthcare provider. If an individual doesn’t have a primary care physician, several health care systems are providing telehealth services so residents may be evaluated by a provider without having to leave their homes.

If it’s determined an individual should be tested, they will be instructed where to go to be tested. Individuals with minor illness are advised not to go to emergency departments, the release said.

Beaufort Memorial Hospital posted a news release Sunday asking for patients or loved ones to call ahead in the event that they have a fever, cough and shortness of breath.

“Your doctor's office will ask you a few questions and then give you appropriate instructions, which may include coming to their office for care or reporting to another site to receive rapid influenza and strep tests,” the post said.

“In some cases, patients may be asked to wait in their cars while a medical provider administers and processes the tests. Patients may be given additional instructions to receive Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) testing.”

Patients must have a physician’s order before receiving a COVID-19 test.

Patients who are sick and concerned about COVID-19 can initiate a video visit with a provider using the BMH Care Anywhere app.

Over the weekend, the hospital opened a drive-thru testing site for patients who have a physician order for a COVID-19 test.

The testing site near the Beaufort Memorial Medical and Administrative Center at 990 Ribaut Rd. in Beaufort is directly across from the hospital. It will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 1-5 p.m. Sunday.

On Monday, hospital representatives did not provide comment when asked for an update regarding the status of four staff members who were in self-quarantine after having contact with two people undergoing testing for the coronavirus.

Spokesperson Courtney McDermott said Saturday the hospital would not confirm if the Beaufort County cases were among those it sent to DHEC for testing.

The hospital has the following visitor restrictions in place:

• Only immediate family members over age 18 are allowed to visit patients.

• Only one visitor per patient is allowed. Additional visitors should not come to the hospital.

• Groups of visitors “taking turns” in and out of a patient’s room will not be permitted.

• Visitors with any symptoms of illness will not be allowed to visit patients or patient care areas.

The restrictions will remain in place until further notice.

Hilton Head Regional Healthcare currently has similar restrictions in place:

• No visits from children under the age of 18.

• Visitation is limited to one visitor per patient.

• No visits from people with fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath.

• No visits to any patient who is being tested or has a confirmed case of COVID-19.

For prevention, the public is reminded to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs with an elbow, stay home when sick, don’t attend public gatherings, and appropriately dispose tissues and other items with germs on them.",state_of_emergency,10085.0,40.7426,-85.173

They are doing it because they are concerned for their children and because they are told to keep children home if possible. But mostly they are doing it because childcare is expensive. When families lose their income, childcare is an obvious place to cut.

But once families pull out, the government subsidies that fund wages and rent for childcare centres go, which forces our education and care centres to close their doors eventually.

Childcare and coronavirus: Australian families won't be penalised for keeping children home Read more

They have been told they have to stay open to care for the children of essential workers and for children whose parents are working from home and can’t work with a toddler underfoot. But the centres can no longer afford to stay open.

Northside Community Services runs five long day cares in Canberra. Their executive director, Anna Whitty, puts it this way:

As a provider of early education, we’ve never had to deal with a crisis like this. Families are concerned, and understandably have been ending their children’s enrolments and keeping them at home. This has had an immediate and direct impact on our financial situation, which will only continue to get worse. We’ve committed to doing everything we can to keep paying our incredible team of educators across our centres, but we can’t keep that up forever – like every other early education provider we are facing incredibly difficult choices at the moment.”

The ex-director of an out of school hours care service in Western Australia says:

We are community managed and operated out of a school site. The management committee decided to close the service because we only had a few children still coming. All our educators were casual. They were given the option of becoming permanent part-time last year but they couldn’t afford to – the casual loading was what made their jobs possible. So they are now all gone.”

Goodstart Early Learning, one of Australia’s largest providers, had to lay off 4,000 casual educators last week.

Melinda Gambley is the director of a state-funded preschool in northern New South Wales.

She says:

As of now, we’re still open, but we don’t know when this could change. We went from 32 children attending, to just two by the end of last week. Parents and staff are anxious about their children, their own health and passing the virus on to their families. Our children’s families work in or own small businesses in tourism or hospitality. Many have lost their jobs or businesses. All are worried about money. Our staff keep showing up day after day, despite the risks to their own health, but they don’t know if they will have jobs to return to after the Easter break. None are paid well enough to have money set aside for a rainy day. And the children! Their routines have changed. They’re confused and sad. For some of them, we are their first relationships outside of their immediate family. They miss their teachers and their friends. One little girl said this week: ‘I’m really sad ‘cause I’ve got no brothers and sisters to play with and now I’ve got no friends at preschool either’. We miss the ones that are at home and we worry about them. We hope they are all safe.”

Unlike schools, childcare services are not actually government funded. Instead, parents pass on to centres the subsidies they receive and pay the gap fees.

On top of this convoluted method of funding, successive governments have increasingly privatised the whole gig. Our long day cares are now as likely to be run by large corporate providers and small businesses. Our out-of-school hours services are either owned by multinational private equity firms, or they are not-for-profit, or parent run. There is also no clear constitutional divide as to who should fund services either – the states or the commonwealth – which adds to the complexity.

The government should be paying more for childcare. Instead families are struggling with costs | Jen Jackson for the Conversation Read more

The childcare subsidy is a dog’s breakfast of rules and legislation. One of the last days that parliament sat, it passed changes to give the government some outs to this. But until services are actually closed, no funds are available. Services can’t even remove the gap fees for parents without committing fraud. The government opened a small grant program and now has to process over 14,000 applications. This won’t happen fast. There are ways for parents to claim higher subsidies, but these all involve myGov.

The educators and directors who are desperately trying to keep these services afloat are of the opinion that this is all barmy. The bureaucrats are so wedded to their complex funding models that they can’t think outside those models.

There was $8bn allocated to childcare in the last budget. All it would take to keep the sector running is to pay some of this money directly to each service, and bingo – we could continue to provide childcare to every child and family that needs it.

But unless this happen this week, services will close, and their educators will scatter.

When our nurses and doctors can’t turn up to their jobs because they have no one to look after their children there will be an uproar.

By then it will be too late to re-open them.

Under ‘Stay At Home’ Orders Due To Spread Of Coronavirus,"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Westmoreland County and Butler County have been added to the list of Western Pennsylvania counties under ‘Stay At Home’ orders, which went into effect at 8:00 p.m. Friday night.

The State Department of Health says the ‘Stay at Home’ order is necessary to “protect the public from the spread of COVID-19”.

Butler Health system confirms to KDKA News that so far, they have conducted 788 tests, 562 at the hospital’s outdoor facility.

There are 15 patients being treated at Butler Memorial Hospital.

One confirmed COVID-19 patient, and 14 patients suspected to have COVID-19.

7 of those patients are in the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit.

Butler Memorial says it has surge capacity plans in place for all types of patients.

Among those who tested positive at Butler Memorial’s Drive-through site for COVID-19, Representative Mike Kelly, a Butler native.

Representative Kelly announced on social media today he started experiencing “mild flu-like symptoms earlier this week”.

The concern of community spread, the reason the state necessitated Butler County to be placed under “Stay At Home” Orders.

“Getting the economy started again is important, but if we don’t have our health then we don’t have anything else,” said Thomas Waldenville of Butler.

“It’s an appropriate order considering the number of cases and how contagious this is and how severe it is,” said Laura Spack of Butler.

At the VA Hospital in Butler, drive-through testing will begin Monday for Veterans whose physicians indicate they should be tested.

It is by appointment only.

‘Stay at Home’ orders have also been issued for Westmoreland County as of 8:00 p.m. Friday night as well.

The numbers of those infected by COVID-19 in Westmoreland County has climbed to 30.

In addition, 450 county workers are being furloughed April 3rd.

“It’s heartbreaking because we spent many hours going over this. We have to do what’s right for the people of the county,” said Westmoreland County Commissioner Sean Kertes.

Roland “Bud” Mertz, Westmoreland County Public Safety’s Director told KDKA News, “We’re behind New York City. We don’t want that to happen here. We don’t want our hospitals overrun and have people in the hallways.”

Butler Health System says they’ve received many donations of personal protective equipment like masks but they’re encouraging community partners to continue donations.

Cambridge City,IN,03-24-2020 00:00,https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2020/3/24/city-council-coronavirus-measures/,Cambridge City Council Passes Measures to Mitigate Effects of Coronavirus,"The Cambridge City Council passed several measures Monday evening intended to give financial support to small businesses in Cambridge, identify potential emergency shelters, and halt in-person real estate showings during the coronavirus outbreak.

The City of Cambridge and the Cambridge Department of Public Health declared a public health emergency over COVID-19 Thursday evening, following the closure of Cambridge Public Schools and cancellation of all “non-essential” city meetings on Mar. 13. There are currently twenty recorded cases of coronavirus in Cambridge.

At the state level, Massachusetts Governor Charlie D. Baker ’79 ordered all non-essential businesses to shut down and issued a stay-at-home advisory on Monday. Baker declared a state of emergency on March 10 after the number of recorded coronavirus cases in Massachusetts doubled overnight.

According to the policy order — which was filed by Councilor Quinton Y. Zondervan and Councilor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler — “emergency appropriations” will provide financial relief to organizations whose operations have been limited by social distancing recommendations and requirements.

The measure passed by the City Council during their weekly meeting will allow the City Manager’s office to direct funds toward arts and culture institutions, nonprofits, food service establishments, and other businesses.

The policy order also states that loss of revenue associated with COVID-19 will be an “impossible hurdle to overcome without assistance.”

During Monday’s meeting, Zondervan said the measure would help “ensure [the] survival” of arts and non-profit organizations that “may not be eligible for some of the financial relief that may be forthcoming from the state government.”

The policy order also states that “the positive, uplifting power of art and music will be an important component of our healing process in the months to come.”

The City Council passed a measure asking the City Manager and directors of Cambridge’s assessment and inspection services to “compile an up-to-date list of housing units and buildings currently vacant in Cambridge” that may be used to house homeless individuals in the city while meeting the requirements of social distancing.

The policy order states homeless individuals are “especially vulnerable to the transmission and severe health risks of COVID-19, as many are older, struggle with compounding disabilities, and have little to no access to healthcare.”

There were 408 homeless people in Cambridge in 2018, according to an estimate from the Cambridge Department of Human Services.

Following the lead of Boston Mayor Marty J. Walsh, the City Council also passed a measure that will prevent brokers, landlords, and real estate agents from conducting in-person apartment showings during the COVID-19 pandemic. The measure is intended to curb the transmission of coronavirus.

The City Council also passed separate measures to support senior citizens in Cambridge and make city council meetings more accessible during the coronavirus outbreak by promoting social distancing.

Cambridge residents can now use Zoom — an online teleconferencing platform — to participate in the public comments section of city council meetings.

Mayor Sumbul Siddiqui and Councilor Timothy J. Toomey Jr. attended Monday’s meeting in-person at city hall while Vice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon, Councilor Dennis J. Carlone, Councilor Marc C. McGovern, Councilor Patricia M. Nolan ’80, Councilor E. Denise Simmons, Sobrinho-Wheeler, and Zondervan participated remotely.

CAMDEN — Camden County has declared a state of emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19, or novel coronavirus, effective at the end of business Monday.

The City of Camden followed suit a short time later, with Mayor Frank Moran closing most city offices effective at 4:30 p.m. Monday for at least two weeks. City Hall and all municipal buildings would be closed to the public, Moran said.

Moran also said city government was working with local utility companies, including PSE&G and American Water, to make sure there were no shut-offs due to lack of payment, as city residents face potentially weeks out of work or on severely scaled-back schedules.

The county state of emergency will last until at least March 31, the county said in a statement.

All non-essential employees and county personnel have been directed to work from home beginning Tuesday. Those who work in law enforcement, corrections, public safety and others will still be required to report for work as usual, the county said.

Non-essential employees are required to remain on call, and to work remotely as needed.

The City of Camden will continue essential operations such as trash collection; the Camden County Police Department will continue to ensure public safety, as will the Camden Fire Department, Moran said.

All city schools will close for students beginning Tuesday, said superintendent Katrina McCombs. Students and parents may pick up their remote learning packets at their schools from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Tuesday.

City schools will also continue to provide breakfast and lunch for students who rely on them for meals, McCombs said, adding that any student in Camden may go to any meal distribution site, regardless of what school that student attends. A list of sites may be found at www.camden.k12.nj.us/ and will be updated, she said.

In addition, Moran said he designated all city crossing guards as essential employees, so that they may help students get to and from the food distribution sites at schools safely.

Moran called the situation ""absolutely unprecedented,"" adding, ""We need to take seriously.""

""This is the new norm for us until we get clearance from the state and the (Centers for Disease Control),"" Moran said at a news conference Monday afternoon at City Hall. He spoke in Council Chambers to a room with media dispersed feet apart, with chairs set about six feet away.

He was joined by Lt. Gabe Rodriguez of the Camden County Police, Chief Michael Harper from the fire department, McCombs and Keith Walker, director of the city's Department of Public Works — all of whom were seated about 6 feet away from each other, an example of the ""social distancing"" he hopes city residents will do their best to emulate.

Moran said he expects grocery stores, pharmacies and medical offices will remain open — as will Camden's bodegas.

""As you all know, not everybody in the City of Camden can get to a big box store to (get) their grocery necessities ... and we recognize that, so we will be monitoring them and working closely with them,"" Moran said.

Burlington County said Sunday night that its offices will be closed to the public.

Camden County's announcement came shortly before the disclosure that a third county resident had tested positive for the coronavirus. Details about that case were not immediately available.

On Friday, county officials announced a second person, a woman in Cherry Hill, tested positive for the virus, which has forced statewide closures and curfews. She was self-quarantined at home and doing well, Camden County Freeholder Director Lou Cappelli said.

The county's first coronavirus patient, a Cherry Hill man in his 60s, was discharged from the hospital, according to Cappelli.

“The declaration is being utilized to protect the public health and ensure personnel can be home to care for their families during this unprecedented time,” said Cappelli in a statement Monday afternoon.

“This was not an easy decision to reach, however, our priority is to make judicious decisions that will benefit us all, flatten the curve, and reduce the spread of this virus. We will be constantly reevaluating our operations to ensure that we can provide these services while continuing to protect our employees and our residents.”

The impact of the county state of emergency is as follows:

County libraries will close at 5 p.m. Monday until April 13;

both campuses of Camden County Technical School will close and implement remote learning until at least March 31;

Camden County College extended spring break until March 29 and will transition to virtual learning thereafter;

all sheriff's sales and evictions have been halted;

Camden County Parks permits have been suspended;

the Camden County Pollution Control Financing Authority (PCFA), Municipal Utilities Authority (CCMUA), and Improvement Authority (CCIA), will close and reduce staff to essential personnel only; and

all county-operated and congregate senior center sites will close at 5 p.m. Monday. All senior citizens enrolled in the Camden County Nutrition Program will automatically begin receiving home-delivery of meals Tuesday. In light of broad closures among businesses and restaurants, as well as long lines and limited supply at supermarkets, the Division of Senior and Disabled Services is prepared to provide meals to any senior in need in Camden County, regardless of prior registration. To request assistance, residents should contact the Division at 856-374-MEAL or 856-858-3220.

“We acknowledge that this request is a tough pill to swallow, and we absolutely do not take that reality lightly, however sacrifices made today are necessary if we are to save lives tomorrow,” Cappelli said.

“The science is clear — the more we restrict social interaction, the slower the spread of infection becomes, and the fewer lives ultimately lost. This has become a life or death situation and the time to act is now.”

Those with questions or concerns related to the novel coronavirus may call a 24-hour public hotline at 800-222-1222 or 800-962-1253. Information regarding Camden County’s preparations, response, and general information provided to the public is available by visiting camdencounty.com.

“Due to the state of emergency declaration, it is paramount that I implement new operational procedures that will limit exposure of the public and city staff to the coronavirus,” said New Carlisle’s City Manager Randy Bridge.

As of Monday afternoon, there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19, or coronavirus in Clark County, according to Clark County Combined Health District Commissioner Charles Patterson. COVID-19 is a respiratory condition marked by fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Symptoms can appear up to two weeks after exposure, according to health officials.

However, Patterson said that he believes that there are cases in the community that have not yet been tracked.

In order to take precautions and prevent the virus from potentially spreading in the area, New Carlisle has closed all city owned buildings to the public. The entry way to the City Administration Building will remain open due to the night deposit box, according to a news release sent from the city.

“Should the night deposit box be used to a pay a utility bill, please place your bill stub and payment method in the envelope (provided on sight) to ensure proper account credit,” the release said.

However, city officials are urging residents to pay those utility bills online at www.newcarlisle.net or have the funds automatically deducted from their bank accounts.

Bridge said he is also implementing new work schedules for all full-time city employees. Starting today, city staff have been divided into two groups that will work alternating schedules, he added. In addition, all city sponsored special events over the next several months have been either cancelled or postponed.

City council meetings have also been reduced to once a month and will be held on the first Monday of each month until further notice.

The public is being asked to conduct city business by phone or email if possible and to limit direct contact with employees out in the community, when possible. Face-to-face city meetings have also been discontinued in the meantime.

The Clark County Sheriff’s Office will remain on duty in the city and the New Carlisle Fire Station will be closed to the public.

The order calls for an end to unnecessary travel, closure of all public playgrounds, and advises local workout facilities to close, according to a press release from the city. Banks can remain open, but only with ATM and drive-thru services.

A travel watch has been issued for the corporate limits of the city, according to the release. This means only essential travel for things like medical care, providing care to someone else, mandatory employment activities, getting things like gas and food, delivering food to people or stores, driving when you don't leave your car, and utility and emergency services, is permitted.

Those who are traveling to donate blood can, according to a press release from the city released on Thursday.

The following line was added to the emergency order to provide clarification:

“All persons utilizing a public trail or multi-use path, or visiting a public park, are permitted to travel to and from these facilities and to exit their vehicles in order to make use of them, provided that proper “social distancing” protocols are followed when doing so.”

Brainard also ordered the closure of Brookshire Golf Club except for those who are walking the course, according to the release. The city's Household Hazardous Waste Disposal Site on Range Line Road has also been closed.

The order went into effect at 7 p.m. Wednesday and is in effect until further notice, according to the release.

“I realize that the steps we are taking are difficult for local business owners and residents, but we must act quickly and we must act now to prevent the further spread of this deadly virus that has brought much pain and death to China and European countries and is threatening to do the same here in the United States of America,” Brainard said in the press release. “The pain we are experiencing today is nowhere near the pain we will most certainly experience if we sit back and do nothing. I urge all Carmel residents to join me in fighting this virus.”

The list of following items are included in the new order, according to the release:



A “Watch” travel advisory for the declared emergency is in effect within the corporate limits of the City of Carmel. Under this advisory, only essential travel is permitted and all non-essential travel should be avoided.

All employers within the City of Carmel are strongly encouraged to allow for teleworking arrangements to the maximum extent possible to minimize the amount of mandatory work travel.

All businesses, schools, government agencies, and other organizations located within the City of Carmel should implement their emergency action plans.

All public playgrounds located within the City of Carmel shall be closed. All trails and multi-use paths shall remain open and walking or bicycling thereon, as well as in public parks, is both permitted and encouraged.

In a formality that was a foregone conclusion hours before the brief meeting, the Clarksville City Council gave its unanimous blessing Wednesday afternoon to Mayor Joe Pitts' declaration of a state of emergency in the city to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Pitts declared the city state of emergency on Wednesday to facilitate what Clarksville City Hall intends to be an ""effective local response to the worldwide coronavirus outbreak and prevent the spread of COVID-19.""

In introducing the measure, Pitts had these remarks:

“Our nation and world face an unprecedented event that will define our generation. COVID-19, or the coronavirus, is a serious disease that threatens everyone, without discrimination.

“While we have the best scientists in the world working on prevention and a cure, we know certain irrefutable facts about this disease:

“Washing your hands helps. Keep a safe distance from others. Protect and be kind to one another. Don’t trade in misinformation, partial information or rumors.

“And if your faith is important to you, please pray for the continued safety of our community. I am convinced it is the ‘fervent prayers of a righteous people that availeth much.’"" Pitts said.

With that, the executive order approved by the City Council at a special called meeting took effect upon passage of the resolution. It will continue for seven days, and can be extended as necessary in seven-day increments until April 2.

Asked by Councilman David Allen about what happens beyond then, Pitts indicated that it could be extended still further if necessary.

In review: Coronavirus: State of emergency declared for Montgomery County

The city measure was preceded Tuesday by a state of emergency declared for Montgomery County by County Mayor Jim Durrett.

The city's order directs all Clarksville city departments and offices to minimize person-to-person contact “to the maximum extent possible” by using drive-through window service, and electronic, telephonic and mail methods of communication.

The order closes all Clarksville Parks & Recreation activities, programs and facilities to include swimming pools and recreation centers. Parks will remain open.

It also authorizes department heads to direct certain city employees to work from home.

The declaration also includes a city COVID-19 Response Plan that addresses internal engineering, administrative and work practice controls, and personal protective equipment necessary to reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the city’s employees.

“This order will allow us to take legal steps to prepare the city, its employees and our citizens for a potentially long struggle against this viral outbreak,” Pitts said in a prepared statement. “This will provide us some more flexibility to take proactive steps to protect the health and safety of our residents and employees.”

Clarksville City Hall says all members of the public and businesses are ""strongly encouraged"" to follow and comply with guidance and directives issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and state and local departments of health.

“All members of the public are strongly encouraged to remain calm, to resist panic purchasing, and to look after and help those most at risk to this pandemic to include the elderly and those with suppressed immune systems,” Pitts said.

TOP OF THE HOUR:

Connecticut and Oregon added to list of states under disaster declaration

2 Sri Lankan villages sealed off after positive coronavirus tests

Mnuchin says decision to reopen business will be health decision not economic

Fauci warns U.S. will have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths

More than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.

As the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.

The U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.

Fauci was speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union” as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.

Fauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged “it’s a little iffy there” right now.

With Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.

The White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.

The addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.

Sri Lanka seals off two villages

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.

The villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.

More than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.

Health before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.

Mnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.

But he says President Donald Trump’s top objective is the health of the American public.

Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.

He said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.

He said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.

Louisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed

WASHINGTON — Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state’s health care system.

Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week” that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.

He said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.

He made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.

Muscovites told to stay home

MOSCOW — The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.

A video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch’s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.

Non-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.

14-year-old boy dies in Portugal

LISBON, Portugal — The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.

Minister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.

Portugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.

Pelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn’t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The top Democrat in Congress says the government should be “taking every precaution” and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.

Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump’s “denial” early in the crisis was “deadly.”

She says: “As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.”

Pelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: “What did he know and when did he know it?”

Panama to allow cruise ships to use canal

PANAMA CITY — Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn’t immediately clear.

Holland America Line said via a Facebook post, “We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew” and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.

The Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.

Holland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.

Panamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.

50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations

MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.

Many of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

Complying with the state Sunshine Act, the board had encouraged citizens to email their comments and questions, and eight people did offer both lively praise and criticism. Board President Robert Fisher and Interim Superintendent Rick Dunlap, Jr. were televised from the board conference room, while other board members participated from home.

Dunlap, who said schools will now be closed until April 14, thanked the community for its support and warned the pandemic and economic downturn will likely mean the loss of an additional $500,000 in local revenue from sources including property taxes, and there will be further belt-tightening.

The school board, acting on legal advice, approved disaster emergency resolutions authorizing the superintendent to continue to pay bills, pay professional staff and excuse some staff from work, but with pay and benefits. The emergency powers will extend to June 30.

Resident C. Peter Barringer accused the school district of “taking advantage of a global situation.” He was among several citizens who expressed concern about the school district making decisions prior to board meetings without checks and balances.

Resident Karen Russo complained the school district does not “have its act together” in providing instruction for students stuck at home, but according to the parent advocacy group CCAP, Coatesville Community and Parents, some teachers are providing online learning.

In an effort to help the district offer all students remote learning on Chromebooks, the school board awarded a $42,500 contract to Build Something Different. The firm will receive a $35,000 PAsmart grant and $7,500 from the district to work with staff and build an online learning platform. Students are also receiving free grab-and-go breakfasts and lunches at numerous community sites.

Also visible during the meeting was James Bookman, of Coatesville, selected by the school board to fill the unexpired Region 1 seat of Jill Santiago, who recently resigned. Bookman was sworn in during the meeting and said he wanted to be a voice for students, reach out to legislators about the school district’s challenges and build community relationships.

The school board also: accepted the resignation, for personal reasons, of human resources director Karen Hall; increased the salary of Michelle Kelly, assistant business manager, from $94,916 to $120,000; hired Lori Diefenderfer as business manager on a five-year contract with a $140,000 annual salary; and passed a resolution allowing the superintendent to either suspend or not renew the contracts of 45 professional employees if fewer than 45 staff do not retire before the next school year.

And, much like Charleston’s stay at home order, Columbia’s measure has broad exceptions which will allow “essential” businesses and functions — such as grocery stores, gas stations, media, pharmacies, takeout and delivery restaurant services, manufacturing businesses, banks and insurance offices, commercial and residential construction and repairs, and many, many others — to continue to operate if they so choose.

City Council passed the measure during a Thursday afternoon meeting. The vote was 6-1, with Councilman Daniel Rickenmann voting ""no.""

The order — which the city calls Stay Home, Stay Safe — would go into effect at 12:01 a.m. March 29. The order says that, after that time, “individuals shall stay in their homes and not travel through or congregate in the streets, sidewalks, waterways and/or public spaces in the City of Columbia” unless they are traveling to work or do business with one of the long list of essential services that are allowed under the measure.

The city is ordering those functions operating under the guise of essential services to enforce “social distancing” of at least six feet between people.

Outdoor activity and exercise is still be allowed under the stay at home order, though the measure says citizens should “limit outdoor recreational activities to those that allow for social distancing of at least six feet, do not entail coming into close contact with other people or involve the sharing of equipment.”

The stay at home order is good for 14 days, but the city could go back and extend it if need be.

Columbia’s edict for people to stay at home is just the latest in a string of measures that have been put in place in the Capital City and across South Carolina in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, the lethal virus that has touched off a global pandemic. Columbia currently is under a nightly curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Gov. Henry McMaster has given law enforcement leeway to break up any groups larger than three people in public. The governor has also shuttered all dine-in services at bars and restaurants across South Carolina and barred groups from congregating on the state's beaches.

“It is imperative that residents and non-residents of this great city shelter at home, unless providing or requiring an essential service,” City Council’s March 26 order reads.

Much as as it has done across the rest of the country, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across South Carolina. According to numbers released by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control, as of the afternoon of March 25 there were 424 cases across 39 counties in South Carolina.

Third-term Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said Thursday that he thought a stay at home order was the appropriate next step for a city that is desperate to slow the spread of COVID-19.

""We've been on a smart path, a responsible path, trying to do every single thing we can possibly do to curb the growth of this virus in our community,"" Benjamin said.

As of March 25, eight people had died from the novel coronavirus in South Carolina. Among them was Jack West, the longtime Statehouse lobbyist and son of former Gov. John West.

Second-term Columbia City Councilman Howard Duvall, 77, told Free Times he was in favor of a stay at home order.

""We want to ask people to accept the seriousness of this situation, and start behaving like it is a very serious situation,"" Duvall says. ""Even if you are young and might be able to survive this thing, it is up to all of us to accept the responsibility. It doesn't do me any good, being 77, for a 20-year-old to think they are not going to get it, then give it to me.""

Columbia had an eye on what Charleston did earlier this week as it crafted its draft stay at home ordinance, including its vast list of ""essential services"" exceptions.

""We tried our best to replicate the list that Charleston used in the interests of consistency,"" Benjamin tells Free Times.

As noted by The Post and Courier, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said that city's staff modeled the proposed list of essential businesses on recommendations from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Columbia's measure has a wide array of essential services that are exempted from the stay at home order.

For instance, in the manufacturing sector, it lists ""food processing, manufacturing agents, including all foods and beverages, chemicals, medical equipment/instruments, pharmaceuticals, sanitary products, telecommunications, microelectronics/semi-conductor, agriculture/farms, household paper products, vehicle and aircraft manufacturing"" as exceptions.

Essential retail operations in the order include ""grocery stores and all food and beverage stores, pet stores that sell food and or medications, big box stores or wholesale clubs that have in-house grocery or pharmacy services, pharmacies, convenience stores, direct farm to consumer sales, gas stations, restaurants/bars (but only for take-out or/delivery), hardware and building material store and online retailers that deliver products and services to individual's homes or businesses.""

Banks, credit unions and check cashing services, insurance, payroll, accounting, services related to financial markets and legal services also are listed among the wave of essential services that could continue operating under the proposed measure.

Rickenmann had reservations about the stay at home order. In a statement sent to Free Times, he said such an order is ""the most drastic action any government can take.""

He says he thinks Columbians have been doing a good job social distancing without having a city edict.

""We’re already two weeks into a drastic shutdown of our economy,"" Rickenmann says. ""To close even more businesses for two more weeks could have devastating impacts on our small businesses that can’t afford to stay closed a month. Many may never re-open. The solution to this crisis is to continue to do what we’re doing well and ask everyone high-risk to stay home. If they don’t have families or neighbors to help buy groceries or get medicine, let’s organize that help. But they need to self-quarantine. That’s critical.""

Meanwhile, District 2 Councilman Ed McDowell said during the meeting that Council is tasked with considering the ""human loss"" potential of COVID-19, and that public health was at the top of his mind when considering the stay at home order.

""We are in a human crisis that says, 'We have to do our part,'"" McDowell said.

As for the police department enforcing the stay at home order, Benjamin said at a Thursday night news conference that the Columbia Police Department would use ""common sense and compassion.""

Benjamin was also asked about the fact that McMaster has not issued such an order statewide.

""It's the governor's prerogative,"" the third-term mayor said. ""We have led from the front on this issue. We have not paid attention to political desires or even personal desires. We have followed the data. Good data allows you to make good decisions.

""We have never seen anything like this in over 100 years in this country. It requires thoughtful public health professionals be listened to, and that elected leaders enact policies that help us slow down the curve and the spread of this virus and save lives. That's our goal here. Hopefully the governor will follow suit. I'm not sure that he will.""",shelter_in_place,9535.0,41.1612,-85.4855
Columbus,IN,03-29-2020 00:00,https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200329/coronavirus-ginther-has-broad-powers-as-columbus-mayor-during-emergency,Coronavirus: Ginther has broad powers as Columbus mayor during emergency,"The ordinances that Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther is using to grant emergency powers during the pandemic offer no language specifically spelling out in what forms mayoral orders are to be made. There's also no requirement to keep a journal of contracts issued and city laws waived, City Attorney Zach Klein said.

The early 1970s-era city ordinances that Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther used last week to grant himself emergency powers offer little guidance on the mechanics of how the mayor is to run Ohio's largest city until the coronavirus threat subsides.

They allow Ginther to suspend the enforcement of city codes “as he sees necessary,” for as long as six months, unless terminated earlier by the Columbus City Council. He can unilaterally issue city contracts without limitation, bypassing the normal city council channels, after providing council members with a written explanation “for the selection of the chosen contractor.”

The ordinances granting the emergency powers offer no language specifically spelling out in what forms mayoral orders are to be made, such as verbally or in writing, and no requirement to keep a journal of contracts issued and city laws waived, City Attorney Zach Klein said in an interview last week.

“The Columbus city code is silent to that,” Klein said.

>> This story is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. You can find more stories on coronavirus here. Please support local journalism by subscribing to The Columbus Dispatch at subscribe.dispatch.com.

The city's voluminous purchasing code says that in times of emergency, the mayor may unilaterally make contracts “for the procurement of materials, supplies, equipment, construction or service” without complying with its provisions.

Ginther spokeswoman Robin Davis said that since signing the executive order Wednesday, the administration had waived four city code requirements. One dealt with cleanup from recent flooding; one with deadlines for a Sullivant Avenue project using state and federal dollars; one for a computer contract; and one for the Division of Power to install streetlights.

The state of emergency ensures the city can provide essential city services, Davis said in an email.

“Clear direction has been sent to the directors on how to request and document these waivers,” Davis said. “The city auditor has established a specific code to track expenditures for COVID-19. Any procurement not critical to COVID-19 will go through normal procedures.”

On March 13, Klein sent Ginther and the city council a memo explaining that he had been asked to outline local emergency powers afforded the mayor in emergencies. Because of the “home rule” provisions of the Ohio Constitution, the city creates much of its own laws and rules, it says.

The executive power under the city charter is vested in the mayor, who has the duty of “chief conservator of the peace” and to see that all city ordinances are enforced.

A 1971 ordinance says that “when there is tumult, riot, mob or body of people acting together with the intent to commit a felony,” or during a flood, fire, snowstorm or “any other disaster affecting life and property” that impairs the functioning of the city, any of the following officers in order can declare an emergency: the mayor, the city council president, the director of public safety and the police chief, Klein's memo explained.

When a state of emergency has been declared, any of those people who find themselves in charge can “issue such proclamations as he deems necessary to protect life and property,” specifically including curfews, stopping alcohol and gun sales, and restricting movements of people and assemblies.

These sections of the ordinances don't say how long this could continue. Ginther's order says it will end when Gov. Mike DeWine ends the statewide declaration of emergency.

On March 16, Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin's chief of staff, Michael S. Brown, said that Hardin had decided that the council would not meet again until April 20, “barring an emergency calling us back.” The council held its last meeting that day, with a majority of members voting from remote locations via teleconferencing technology, under guidance from the state auditor.

In a “ceremonial resolution” that night, the council voted unanimously to express support for Ginther “should he invoke and utilize the emergency authority vested in his office.”

Though the city code doesn't specifically ban the mayor from making verbal orders to nullify existing ordinances, “it's definitely not a verbal process,” Councilwoman Elizabeth Brown said of Ginther's powers to act.

“These are extraordinary times, and mountains must be moved to protect health and well-being — in a day's time let alone a week's notice, which is the council meeting schedule.”

Even though the council is currently suspended, members are still in close contact with the administration, said Councilman Rob Dorans.

“We know that this crisis isn't going to pass quickly, therefore it was important to ensure that the mayor has the authority to keep the basic functions of the city operating without city council meeting due to the safety concerns involved,” Dorans wrote in an email. “The executive order will help do so.”

Under the city charter, the auditor is the “chief accounting officer,” responsible for processing, recording, maintaining and reporting all city financial transactions “in accurate, systemized detail.”

City Auditor Megan Kilgore said should her office need to process payments over $50,000 that normally would require city council approval, her protocols will call for the mayor to submit a written request indicating the project, its purpose under the state of emergency, and include appropriate signatures and approvals.

After the emergency passes, the division or department making the request will follow up with the city council to obtain an ordinance, Kilgore said.

Covington,IN,,https://www.nkytribune.com/2020/03/covington-mayor-declares-state-of-emergency-local-order-speeds-city-response-to-covid-19-pandemic/,Covington mayor declares State of Emergency; local order speeds City response to COVID-19 pandemic,"













Covington Mayor Joe Meyer declared a formal State of Emergency in Northern Kentucky’s largest city. The move is a legal maneuver that speeds the City’s ability to take actions to protect the public and mitigate the impact of the spreading coronavirus pandemic.

“Extraordinary times call for extraordinary steps,” the Mayor said. “This is not a normal disaster situation. This declaration will enable us to act more quickly and with flexibility and authority to serious needs and concerns related to the spreading COVID-19 crisis.”

City Manager David Johnston said the City’s declaration is also required for Covington to be reimbursed by federal agencies for disaster-related expenses incurred during this time.

Among other things, the order empowers the Mayor to waive procedures and formalities otherwise required by the law pertaining to:

• Performance of public work.

• Entering into contracts.

• Incurring obligations.

• Employment of permanent and temporary workers.

• Utilization of volunteer workers.

• Rental of equipment.

• Appropriation of public funds.

If necessary, the Mayor could also institute a curfew as a strategy to limit the spread of the highly contagious acute respiratory disease.

Specific changes would be implemented via executive order, and Mayor Meyer announced his intent to sign three specific executive orders in the days ahead:

• Appointing Assistant City Manager Bruce Applegate as the City’s coronavirus pandemic coordinator.

• Granting small businesses a 90-day grace period to pay tax obligations related to occupational license and net profits taxes, mimicking an announcement made by the IRS for individual taxpayers.

• And adjusting attendance protocols for Tuesday night City Commission meetings.

Details of those orders will be published via email and on the City’s website and social media as they are signed.

The emergency declaration will be in effect until rescinded.

As of today, more than 10,000 people in the United States have been diagnosed with COVID-19, and 150 have died. But the confirmed numbers are widely believed to be a fraction of the actual total (given the lack of ability to test sufferers), and the numbers are expected to increase exponentially in the coming weeks.

As pandemic coordinator, Applegate will serve as the point person for public agencies and others, and help sift through the tsunami of information, directives, and advice related to the virus.

“We need consistency for the interpretation of all these rules and information for staff, businesses, and residents,” Meyer said. “The City’s response really does have to be a collaborative effort so we act in a way that reduces confusion.”",state_of_emergency,2509.0,40.1404,-87.3911

Council on March 16 voted unanimously to name Crandall as acting emergency-management director and vested her with the power to suspend or amend sections of the city code as necessary.

On March 17 and 18, she signed eight temporary orders, which included:

* Allowing restaurants in the Old Hilliard Zoning District to create temporary parking spots for carryout orders.

* Allowing businesses to use banner or sandwich-board signs.

* Prohibiting new permits for peddling, soliciting or conducting market research door-to-door and suspending previously issued permits.

* Establishing a COVID-19 leave-of-absence policy for city employees.

* Postponing all Hilliard Mayor's Court cases until May 13.

""The coronavirus situation is quickly evolving, and it is important that the city be able to act and react quickly and nimbly,"" council President Andy Teater said after the March 16 emergency meeting. Teater also is the city's ceremonial mayor.

Earlier in the day, Teater had a declaration of emergency, pursuant to section 2.14 of the city charter, according to David Ball, director of communications for Hilliard.

The title of an emergency-management director, when necessary, may be delegated to a designated individual, Ball said.

In this instance, it will be Crandall, he said.

""This will allow the city to respond quickly to emerging needs, issues and opportunities in the coming weeks,' Ball said. ""These temporary modifications will be communicated on the city's website and other communication channels, as appropriate.""

The resolution granting Crandall emergency powers does not have a sunset, a fact that was called to attention by council member Omar Tarazi, who suggested language be added to establish a specific date or to align when Ohio ended a state of emergency, but Teater replied he was ""comfortable"" with the resolution as presented, and it ""would be used properly.""

""This legislation is a logical and necessary step to empower the city manager to make certain temporary changes to code that are in the best interest of our community without waiting for the next council meeting or scheduling an emergency meeting,"" Teater said.

However, Crandall and Teater indicated future action would be taken, when appropriate, to declare an end to the citywide emergency.

All the orders are related to COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic that has brought sweeping action statewide in an effort to contain the spread of the disease.

The most recent orders include postponing all Hilliard Mayor’s Court cases until May 13.

Defendants and defense counsel will be mailed notices of new court dates and questions may be addressed to the court by calling 614-334-2361 or via email at court@hilliardohio.gov.

The clerk of courts’ office also is closed to public walk-in traffic through May 13.

Contact may be made via phone or email; payments will be accepted online or via telephone, according to the city.

Another order suspended all permits for peddling, soliciting or conducting market research door-to-door.

Finally, Crandall signed an order detailing a COVID-19 leave-of-absence policy for city employees.

The order covers use of leave, protocol for contracting COVID-19 symptoms, compensation for part-time employees, child care and other issues.

The Hilliard Division of Police also announced more COVID-19-related policy and protocols March 18.

The police division and the Norwich Township Fire Department have implemented a “unified command structure” in which the role of incident commander is shared by multiple people, each having authority for a different responding agency, said David Ball, director of communications for Hilliard.

“This collaborative structure promotes better response to situations, shared resources and improved communication between agencies,” Ball said.

Police are implementing new guidelines when responding to calls, including asking residents to step outside and to maintain minimum distances.

Police also have implemented a telephone-reporting system at 614-876-7321 for crimes that include theft, fraud, vandalism, stolen vehicles, private-property traffic crashes and animal complaints.

Those reports also may be made online at hilliardohio.gov/onlinereporting.

EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Seated about six feet apart from one another, the three Vanderburgh County Commissioners solemnly voted Monday to declare a State of Emergency due to the coronavirus spread.

The declaration, which has the force of the law, applies to the City of Evansville, as well. Mayor Lloyd Winnecke endorsed the move, citing public health officials' plea that citizens not congregate in large numbers.

City and county governments are following Gov. Eric Holcomb's newest order of limiting public gatherings to 50.

The declaration means the Civic Center is closed to the public. Government employees will still work, although some may do so offsite. Officials stressed local government is not closing, and many services are available online.

Other public facilities that will temporarily close include Mesker Park Zoo & Botanic Garden, Swonder Ice Arena, the Old Courthouse, Lloyd Pool, C.K. Newsome Center and Old National Events Plaza.

The State of Emergency also means local government officials can bypass some normal procedures if need be.

""This situation requires rapid decision-making,"" County Commissioners President Jeff Hatfield said. ""This declaration will allow this government to act in a very quick manner. Before county government would be very cumbersome and somewhat tied in its reaction time to this. This declaration will free us of that, and it's necessary for the public's health.""

The declaration is for seven days and may be renewed in seven-day increments as needed. After about 15 minutes, Monday's emergency meeting of County Commissioners was recessed, not adjourned.

State officials made clear Monday that community spread of coronavirus has arrived in Indiana, that it goes from person to person, and it's not always obvious where a person acquired the virus.

Vanderburgh County Health Officer Dr. Ken Spear told County Commissioners Monday that there's no vaccine for coronavirus and social distancing is needed to slow the spread.

Hatfield, Winnecke and others cited the need to follow the direction of Spear and health experts at the state level.

They noted Holcomb's decision to close restaurants and bars, except for carryout, to contain the virus.

Winnecke said it's reasonable to believe the virus exists in Evansville and Vanderburgh County, even though there has not been a confirmed positive test yet.

""I'm on daily calls with the health department as well as our two hospitals,"" Winnecke said. ""My understanding is they have a number of tests out to be examined. Not to speak on their behalf, but yes, I think it's safe to assume the virus is probably in our community. It's safe to assume that.""

Hatfield said it is important that businesses continuing to operate follow Occupational Health and Safety Administration guidelines to protect their employees.

Winnecke encouraged the public to continue to patronize local small businesses, and he asked the Southwest Indiana Chamber to help develop a list of restaurants with carryout availability.

""I still believe if we're calm and flexible, we will all prevail,"" the mayor said. ""These actions today, while somewhat dramatic, are meant to be precautionary.""

City of Fillmore City of Fillmore

The City of Fillmore has declared a Local Emergency due to the Public Health threat caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19). Although there are still zero confirmed cases in Fillmore, the declaration is out of an abundance of caution to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our community members and employees. This action is in response to the Ventura County Public Health Department’s recent announcement declaring a local emergency and the Governor’s recent declaration of a state of emergency. The City of Fillmore’s emergency declaration will enable City officials and staff to mobilize resources, formalize an emergency action and contingency plan, and obtain additional resources should an outbreak occur in the City.

As of March 12th, 95 people have been tested by the Ventura County Public Health Lab for COVID-19, 2 results are pending confirmation and 22 travelers are on home quarantine. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is easily spread through personal contact, which can lead to serious illness or death for vulnerable members of the community.

The City of Fillmore is following the Ventura County Public Health Department’s latest recommendations and the State’s public health experts to cancel and postpone community events and gatherings where large groups are expected. Consequently, the City of Fillmore is implementing the following precautionary measures:

- Cancellation and postponement of March, April and May community events including

Saint Patrick’s Day Fun Run, Easter Egg Hunt, Community Art Show, and the May Festival.

- Any facility rentals will still be held as scheduled.

-

We apologize for any inconvenience these measures may have caused, however the well-being of our community and staff is the City’s highest priority. Please visit our social media page and website fillmoreca.gov for up to date information or vcemergency.com

Community members are strongly encouraged to follow the Ventura County Public Health Department’s recommendations to protect themselves from the COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses highlighted below:

- If you have mild symptoms, there may be no need to go to a medical facility to see a doctor.

- Certain patients, such as the elderly, those that are immune compromised or have underlying health conditions should call their doctor.

- Primary care doctors are the point of contact for COVID-19 testing. You do not need to call Public Health to request COVID-19 testing. Your doctor will make the decision to test at one of the local private labs and if the test is positive your doctor will contact Public Health for confirmation.

- If you have questions, please call the clinic or your doctor before going in. If you do not have a healthcare provider, call 211 for assistance finding support near you.

- Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

- Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

- Get immunized against the flu to protect yourself and your family, and reduce the potential strain on the healthcare system, which may be impacted by COVID-19 concerns.

- Stay home if you are sick.

FISHERS, Ind. -- Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness announced Monday the declaration of a local disaster emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“As more information comes available, it’s important that we continue to further reinforce the recommendations I’ve shared before. By declaring a local disaster emergency, I’m able to implement a travel advisory watch for the city of Fishers for the next seven days, the maximum limit allowed by law. I’m asking that all residents eliminate any unnecessary travel. Additionally, while I do not have specific legal authority to close the following establishments at this time, I am urging the following establishments to close until the end of the month: entertainment venues and centers; fitness facilities and gyms; and places of worship. I firmly believe it is our civic responsibility for all of us to make the right choices and make sacrifices to ensure the long-term safety and sustainability of our community.” Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness

Officials say the restriction does not impact travel for food delivery or the resupply of retail stores, pharmacies and food pantries.

“You’ve got to just go with the flow and hopefully they can get rid of this as soon as possible,” said South Fulton resident Larry Riley.

“If anything is going to happen, it’s going be during the day not at night,” said resident Janelle Suriel. “So, it’s weird.”

Under the resolution, South Fulton officials have also issued a curfew between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. for all residents, excluding people going to and from work, emergency personnel, essential city personnel, and people making deliveries.

All nonessential businesses, outside of medical and pharmaceutical establishments, have been ordered to close in-door public access by 9 p.m. as well.

“For right now, we are not anticipating any arrests surrounding this issue,” said Chief Meadows. “If repeated violations do occur, we would look at the possibility of issuing citations.”

The order will continue indefinitely until further notice.

“We do not want to come across as an occupied force. Our primary goal is to educate,” said Chief Meadows.

“It was important for the City to enact its own emergency plan to do our part to limit the spread of COVID-19 throughout the City of South Fulton,"" Mayor William ""Bill"" Edwards said.

Tony Evers declared a public health emergency over COVID-19 last week, and ordered all bar and restaurant dine-in facilities closed this week in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.

Greensburg council will meet Friday to make the city’s coronavirus emergency declaration official.

Mayor Robert Bell declared a state of emergency last week, but council is required by law to vote to ratify the declaration.

Bell said Friday’s 10 a.m. meeting is expected to be brief. The emergency declaration is the only item on the agenda.

Declaring a state of emergency gives municipalities shortcuts to help deal with a crisis, Bell said. For example, in normal times the city would have to go through a lengthy bidding process before buying protective equipment. During an emergency, if the equipment is to be used to fight the pandemic, it can be purchased immediately.

The declaration also gives the city a chance of recouping some of the money spent fighting the pandemic from the federal government.

There were 24 confirmed cases of covid-19 in Westmoreland County as of Thursday.

Greensburg last week closed all municipal facilities, including city hall and public parks, to slow the spread of the disease.

The county's action follows similar measures from Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine.

""It will allow us to accept federal funds to respond to the emergent nature of what's happening in our community and what may happen in our community,"" said County Commission President Denise Driehaus. ""And it also allows up to speed up purchasing. So, as we need to do things at the county and get materials and supplies, we will be able to do that more quickly.""

Driehaus also said the emergency declaration will raise public awareness about the virus.

Interim County Health Commissioner Greg Kesterman said public health officials know from previous pandemics, the sooner officials take action, the sooner they can slow down the spike of illness. He said that's why there's been a focus on large events.

""When we are able to slow down the spread of disease and slow down the incidence of humans getting sick, we're able to keep the numbers within a more controllable level,"" Kesterman said. ""So, it's extremely important that we take the interventions now, including the state of emergency, to ensure that we are not going to see that spike. Everything we do today will prevent that spike from happening is our belief.""

The Hamilton County Health Department is tracking several potential cases of COVID-19 in the county, but Kesterman said officials have been asked not to provide those numbers publicly.

""Anytime somebody has been associated with a person under investigation, is a person under investigation, or has known travel history, those individuals are being tracked at a county level,"" Kesterman said. ""The county health department then contacts those individuals and we have done so. Hamilton County Public Health has had those contacts and still has those contacts countywide. So we are tracking those individuals once per day.""

Kesterman has recommended that residents wash hands frequently, avoid unnecessary large gatherings, and practice social distancing.

Hamilton County Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency Director Nick Crossley said his message is ""prepare don't panic."" Crossley was asked how the public should respond to that message, when they see so many events being canceled over concern about COVID-19.

""Again, we can show you the research that shows if we don't have these large gatherings - 250 people is still a large gathering, but especially the much larger gatherings - that we can contain this,"" Crossley said. ""And we do anticipate this being for a short time. So, I think, you know, you see some seasons canceled, some seasons delayed.""

DeWine issued an executive order Thursday banning gatherings of 100 people or more in a single space at the same time.

Hamilton County's various departments are taking additional measures:

The sheriff has stopped all non-essential inmate visits

The clerk of courts is recommending residents use online systems to interact with the courts where possible and avoid coming to the courthouse

The courts are prohibiting non-essential visitors from the courthouse

Starting next week, the county will modify the jury selection system so 150 to 200 people aren't sitting around a jury room waiting to see if they're needed for cases

The Board of Elections is taking measures to ensure polling places for next week's primary election are sanitized. The BOE is also still seeking poll workers after some older workers have asked not to work because of concerns about COVID-19. The BOE is even asking county workers in other departments to help as poll workers.

Meanwhile Driehaus, Kesterman, Crossley, and County Administrator Jeff Aluotto will be holding weekly teleconferences starting Friday to update local government officials in cities, villages and township on the county's response efforts.",state_of_emergency,1547.0,41.5409,-84.9204

On Tuesday, March 24, the City Council joined a teleconference with City Clerk Betty Hughes, who ran the meeting at the council chambers. No members of the public attended the special meeting, Hughes said.

Adopting the resolution helps the city qualify for state, federal, and other funding opportunities related to the crisis. According to a report to the City Council, the fiscal impact to the city due to the outbreak will be “significant.”

The move also “authorizes the undertaking of extraordinary police powers, provides limited immunity for emergency actions of public employees and governing bodies, and authorizes the issuance of orders and regulations to protect life and property,” according to the report. “The proclamation of local emergency will allow the City Manager to take any actions necessary to address or mitigate impacts COVID-19 have on City operations and services.”

The vote was 4-0 with Councilwoman Anaeli Solano absent.

Other steps taken by the city to slow the spread of the virus include closing City Hall through April 6, though most activities can be done by mail and email, and canceling or postponing the Citrus Harvest Festival originally set for Saturday, March 28.

The declaration came after a 7-0 City Council vote to amend the city code to create a process for civil emergencies and was followed by another unanimous vote extending the state of emergency until the next council meeting.

""It will not go on indefinitely,"" Rotering said. ""We are scheduled to meet again April 6. But, within the resolution, there's also the opportunity to call a special meeting, as we have today. So we can call a special meeting in a week, we can call a special meeting in two days, whenever it's necessary to end these powers.""



Most local governments in the state have not incorporated authority granted by the Illinois Municipal Code to declare their own states of emergency, Corporation Counsel Steve Elrod explained. He said his firm Elrod Friedman encouraged all its municipal clients to put such provisions on their books.

""We are in interesting times and very fluid times, dealing with a state of emergency that has been called at the not only at the national level but at the state level,"" Elrod said. ""There are certain powers that have been codified into Illinois statute that would currently appear, without any further action by the City Council, [to] allow the mayor and the city manager ... to exercise certain extraordinary powers. Many of those powers have not been tested in the 150-year existence of the city of Highland Park, and in my opinion, ought to be confirmed by the corporate authorities.""

The initial orders were limited to a direction for city officials to coordinate with other public bodies in the state, implementing emergency staffing protocols for employees of the city's fire, police and public works departments, and executing emergency contracts. The ordinance and the emergency declaration allow for additional emergency regulations and orders.

Late Monday, Rotering issued a supplemental orders shuttering all health and recreational clubs and all motion picture and live performance theaters starting at the close of business Tuesday. The move followed an executive order issued earlier in the day by Gov. JB Pritkzer implementing a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more and shuttering dine-in restaurants and bars.

""It is difficult to order the closure of businesses within our community, however, theaters, health clubs, and recreational clubs naturally result in individuals interacting in close quarters. As we've seen worldwide, an effective method to combat COVID-19 is maintaining significant distances between people,"" Rotering said. ""After discussions with the City Council, City Manager and evaluating guidance provided by the CDC and Illinois Department of Public Health, it became clear that the closure of such facilities was necessary as we work to diminish the spread of COVID-19.""

City Manager Ghida Neukirch reminded the community that emergency services will remain available, even as municipal buildings close to the public.

""The general public is encouraged to take social distancing practices and adhere to public health recommendations for staying healthy,"" Neukirch said. ""Please know that your city is in close communication with our government partners in Highland Park, with state and federal agencies, with neighboring municipalities, Highland Park Hospital and, really, the entire community.""

In a statement at the March 14 emergency meeting, after declaring the state of emergency, Rotering urged residents to support one another and heed warnings from public health officials.

""This week has seen dramatic steps being taken to accelerate social distancing in an effort to slow down the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the anticipated challenges to our health care system. In recent days, our city has experienced the closure of all public access to city buildings except the police station, the senior center, the library, all schools, all park district facilities, Ravinia Festival, the art center and more. While these steps may seem extreme, they are advised by the careful guidance of the Illinois Department of Public Health, which urges all Illinois residents to reduce social contact as much as possible,"" she said.

""I cannot stress this enough: stay home. Let's do everything we can to minimize social contact and slow the spread of this virus. If your kids are home or coming home from college, please keep them at home. This is not a time for gatherings — for hanging at friends' houses. We know that younger people tend not to show major symptoms of the virus yet shed the virus into their environs. By visiting each other, we can be spreading the risk to others, specifically older adults and folks with underlying health issues.""

Rotering said people with symptoms of the virus — fever, cough and shortness of breath — should contact their doctor to arrange for potential testing.

""This is not the city of Highland Park's area. I urge you, call Lake County Health,"" Rotering said. ""Anyone who is not feeling well should seek medical care without fear. Documentation status will not be checked before care is provided. It's critical that everybody get medical help if needed as quickly as possible.""

Rotering also asked the community to consider how to support the most vulnerable in the community. The mayor said the Moraine Township food pantry needs donations from the public at its office at 800 Central Ave. Goods can be dropped off weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. outside the office. Needed this week: oatmeal, canned fruit or fruit cups, cereal, crackers, tuna, mac & cheese, pasta, pasta sauce and paper bags with handles. The township also accepts donations. Call 847-432-3240 for more information.

""Please check on your neighbors. As we self-quarantine and socially distance ourselves, concerns about seniors and others becoming isolated are critically important, and while the city is offering well-being checks, we need everybody's help. Think about your neighborhood. Think about your network. Who's living alone? Who might get sick with nobody knowing? Who might run out of food or medication with no way to get help? Every one of us knows people who are elderly, or disabled or living alone or otherwise unable to get what they need during this crisis. Please, make a plan to check on them daily. It can be by phone, it can be by email, it can be by a door knock and then a few steps back from the door, if they're sick. Let's keep an eye on everybody. Nobody should be left alone during this crisis,"" she said. ""If we all, street by street, block by block, think of who needs to be checked on, we can keep all members of our community safe, and if that friend, or neighbor, or family member does not respond, please call the Highland Park police and they will check up on them. Together we can care for each other and pull through this time of challenge.""

UPDATE: The city declared an emergency Thursday evening to deal with the spread of COVID-19.

The city manager of Hillsboro has declared a state of emergency, the city government announced Thursday evening, March 12.

The announcement comes after the Oregon Health Authority reported three new presumptive cases of the novel coronavirus, including two more cases in Washington County and one in Clackamas County.

The results bring the total of Oregon cases to 24. The majority of those cases, 10, are in Washington County.

Hillsboro City Manager Robby Hammond has the authority to determine if an emergency exists. The Hillsboro City Council can then choose whether to ratify the declaration within seven days. After that, the decision expires after two weeks and can be extended in one-week increments.

""To be clear, we are not declaring a public health emergency. That is not our role,"" Hammond said in a statement. ""Rather, this action will allow us to buy the necessary equipment and supplies related to our response, if necessary, without being slowed down by certain processes. It will also allow us to adjust our staffing and city operations to best serve the community should that become necessary.""

The council will vote to ratify the declaration Tuesday, March 17, according to the city's statement.

An emergency declaration gives the city manager the authority to take actions related to the emergency, including curfews, closures and evacuations.

""Anything necessary to avoid imminent threats to life or property,"" added Hillsboro's public affairs manager, Patrick Preston.

The decision also allows the city to suspend procurement requirements for public contracting, such as eliminating a requirement to get multiple bids before making a purchase in order to deal with the emergency.

""Typically, the reason for declaring a state of emergency is when an incident inside the city has reached a point where resources are extremely limited or have been exhausted, including funding, staffing and material goods,"" said Preston.

Mayor Steve Callaway explained the decision in a video statement Thursday evening.

""We understand our responsibility as public servants to ensure continued operations, but you may see further impacts on non-essential events,"" Callaway advised.

He concluded, ""Let's remember what connects us all: a love of our community, and a desire to serve each other.""

Also on Thursday, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler declared a state of emergency in the city. The decision was announced during Gov. Kate Brown's press conference in relation to COVID-19.

Currently, Hillsboro has no plans to cancel next week's City Council meeting.

The meetings are available to watch through Tualatin Valley Community Television on cable, and later via recorded video on the TVCTV website.

""We would advise people to follow the guidance of health experts in practicing social distancing and maintain at least three feet distance from others to prevent spreading of COVID-19,"" Preston said. ""We have canceled Youth Invasion set for next week and several other upcoming events, and we are assessing all city events and operations right now.""

HUDSON – A local state of emergency has been declared in Hudson amidst the coronavirus outbreak.

Selectmen and the Board of Health signed off on the declaration during a joint meeting Monday night. All members were either present or participated in the meeting remotely.

Executive Assistant Thomas Moses said the primary reason for declaring a state of emergency is allow town officials to reallocate staff members in departments that are largely closed – such as the Recreation Department, library and assessors office – to offices that need more assistance, such as the Health Department.

The town could receive priority access to state and federal funding from agencies, such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, related to the coronavirus.

About 75 Massachusetts communities have declared a state of emergency, including Marlborough and Framingham.

Two Hudson residents have tested positive for the coronavirus. The first confirmed positive test occurred late Wednesday. That resident had traveled recently, though the town Board of Health did not disclose where. The resident was tested at a local hospital and is at home recovering.

A man in his 20s tested positive for the virus on Friday. He recently traveled to Europe, but a statement from the town Board of Health did not indicate where in Europe he had traveled. He was tested at a local hospital and is at home recovering.

Family members of both residents have quarantined. Those potentially exposed to both residents have been traced and contacted.

City leaders met — several feet apart from one another — on Monday evening to unanimously declare a local emergency, approve a three-pronged emergency response plan and officially launch the next phase of that program.

The vote triggered the cancellation of all non-essential recreational services at city libraries and community centers. Library late fees and holds are suspended during the closure.

Huntington Beach already had suspended all library events through April 12.

Essential senior care services, including health checks, transit and meal services, will continue, according to the city’s new response website, HBready.com.

City Manager Oliver Chi added that the city will begin reassigning staff members from departments affected by closures to help serve residents considered more at risk of serious effects from the coronavirus-caused respiratory disease COVID-19 (those in their 60s or older who have preexisting health issues) and create new programs to address the growing problem.

“[Impacts of social distancing are] creating just unprecedented social upheaval right now,” Chi said. “There’s no way to mitigate those impacts, but the silver lining right now is all the different levers that government can try to influence are being pulled to try to mitigate the issues that people are experiencing.”

Following the lead of state and federal officials, Huntington Beach is asking the community to cancel gatherings of 250 or more people, or gatherings of 10 or more people by organizations that serve the higher-risk population.

The City Council’s discussion of specific responses to the coronavirus were punctuated with figures about the virus’s potentially devastating effects.

Fire Chief Scott Haberle said the Orange County healthcare system doesn’t have the capacity to deal with critical-care patients at the potential rate. About 15% of Orange County’s population of about 3 million is 65 or older, according to U.S. Census estimates as of July 1. But the number of staffed hospital and intensive care unit beds in the county amounts to about 5,500, Haberle said.

“The reality is, we can’t build more hospitals overnight,” Haberle said. “We really need to slow the spread of the disease going forward.”

Hotels and other tourist-oriented businesses that pay into the city’s transient occupancy tax are expected to see a sharp decline in revenue due to fewer people traveling — at least a 20% decrease in reservations over the next 3½ months, Chi projected.

Officials estimated a loss of $2.5 million to $3 million in the transient occupancy tax, plus $1 million to $1.5 million in sales taxes, for a total loss of $3.5 million to $4.5 million for the city.

“The local hotel industry in Huntington Beach is really one of the bedrocks of our local economy,” Chi said. “Those ripples go throughout our entire economy.”

The city has been in touch with the Small Business Administration to help local businesses access funding, Chi said.

As part of its response plan, the city also will cancel all work travel, not schedule events with more than 50 people and potentially cancel some commission and community support meetings. City staff also is meeting with community groups, such as the local interfaith council, to coordinate responses for higher-risk populations, Chi said.

“We kind of do what we’re doing here, so it’s not so much worried about us getting the flu or me getting the flu, it’s me transmitting it to somebody else who may not have the wherewithal to combat it,” Councilman Mike Posey said.

(WKBW) — The City of Jamestown has announced they will declare a state of emergency on March 17th and they prepare for cases of coronavirus.

As of now, there are no confirmed cases in Jamestown, but Mayor Eddie Sundquist said he just wants the city prepared. He sees it inevitable that Jamestown has an official case in the near future.

During this state of emergency, Sundquist said they will be conducting spot checks to make sure that businesses are following the state order of half capacity. If they are not in compliance, legal action could take place.

Jamestown schools will also be closing until April 20th. Meals and child care will be offered during this time.

Supermarkets ""will open within specific times, not all the time"", while banks will be ordered to close, ""but perhaps not immediately in order to give people time to secure money,"" the source told Al Jazeera on Saturday night.

More:

The country's only functioning civilian airport, Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport, will not be closed at this time, but that will be considered if the coronavirus outbreak spreads.

The source said the Lebanese cabinet would study a complete ban on movement at an emergency session expected at 3pm (13:00 GMT) on Sunday.

No decision has yet been reached on the matter, and it would include exceptions, the source added.

Formal announcement shortly

Lebanon's Higher Defense Council, which includes representatives from its major security agencies such as the army and the Internal Security Forces, will also meet at 1:30 pm (11:30 GMT) on Sunday.

200313113106897

The extraordinary measures are set to be formalised during Sunday's meetings and are expected to last 15 days, but could be extended, the source said.

Legislator Assem Araji, who heads the Lebanese parliament's health committee, confirmed to Al Jazeera that a state of emergency would be declared on Sunday.

He said the country's land borders with Syria would be closed and urged people to remain home.

""These are precautionary measures to reduce the virus's spread,"" Araji said, denying that the government was withholding any information from the people.

Flights halted

On Wednesday, all schools, universities, restaurants, bars, nightclubs and cultural centres were closed in Lebanon in an effort to prevent large public gatherings.

The coronavirus has infected more than 155,000 people worldwide and killed over 5,800 people, with the World Health Organization on Friday declaring Europe as the new epicentre of the disease.

In Lebanon, 93 people have so far been infected with the virus after the first case was detected on February 21. Three people have died, according to the country's health ministry.

Other nations, including Italy and Iran, have implemented similar emergency measures amid massive outbreaks, while Spain and France have imposed partial lockdowns as cases spike.

The outbreak has hit Lebanon as it suffers its worst economic crisis since independence in 1943, which has weakened the local currency, hiked prices and fuelled unrest.

The financial crisis has led to a shortage of medical supplies needed to combat the outbreak.

Just one hospital in the small Mediterranean nation, Beirut's Rafik Hariri University Hospital, is equipped with specialised isolation rooms compliant with international standards, Araji had previously told Al Jazeera.

Lebanon on Wednesday announced a ban on flights from 11 virus-hit countries, including Iran and Italy, with immediate effect. From Monday onwards, the ban will be extended to a host of European and Arab countries, including Egypt, France, Germany, Iraq, Syria and the United Kingdom.

Many locals have criticised the delay in banning flights from Italy and Iran, the latter being considered a regional epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak.

'We are a family'

Powerful local leader Hassan Nasrallah on Saturday said his country's health ministry, controlled by his party, Hezbollah, had done commendable work and dismissed any criticism.

Meanwhile, medical students have been asked to volunteer to help fight the virus, while many medical staff have reportedly been working without wages for months as the financial crisis deepened.

On Thursday, administrative employees at Rafik Hariri University Hospital announced an open-ended strike over the non-payment of their wages and difficult working conditions.

A video of an emotional volunteer nurse who said she missed her cancer-ridden mother's birthday to help in the efforts was widely shared on social media over the weekend.

""I could be a source of danger if I get close to her, but when the risk is national, on the level of the nation, we have to think about the country as a whole, not as individuals,"" she said in the video.

""Every time we hear of a death, we are saddened, and every time we hear of a recovery, it's like we are victorious. We are a family.""",state_of_emergency,15577.0,40.0318,-86.455

Lebanon Mayor Bernie Ash has declared a state of emergency effective at midnight Monday in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

The order prohibits social gatherings of 10 or more people.

The order includes that bars and restaurants within Lebanon close for on-site consumption and remain closed for on-site consumption until the order is withdrawn. Pick-up, takeout, delivery or drive-thru service is still allowed.

All gyms and exercise and fitness facilities are to close, too.

The order also declares that the city, to the extent possible and provided by law, shall follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance as it relates to COVID-19. The order authorizes the mayor to take reasonably necessary steps to limit person-to-person public access to city offices and facilities and to develop and implement alternative work arrangements and schedules to protect city employees during this pandemic.

Certain procedures and formalities otherwise required under the Lebanon City Code or Tennessee law pertaining to how the city conducts its operations are suspended.

""During this health and economic crisis, I have determined this is the necessary and prudent decision to protect the citizens of our city,” Ash said in a statement. “Please take this pandemic seriously while supporting our local businesses through alternative means.""

Ash has been in daily meetings with key staff and also has been in contact with the Wilson County Health Department, and said information will be provided through webcasts at 1 p.m. and 8 p.m. every day.

Lebanon's action coincides with Gov. Bill Lee's statewide order that limits all Tennessee bars and restaurants to takeout, drive-thru and delivery services only. Bars and restaurants may sell beer and wine by takeout or delivery if sold with food under the governor's order.

Lee also mandated that social gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited and gyms must to close. Visits to nursing homes and retirement homes are limited to ""essential care.""

The governor's order also goes into effect at midnight and continues through April 6.

Mt. Juliet makes COVID-19 statement

Mt. Juliet, also in Wilson County, ""strongly urges"" the community to adhere to the governor's order, according to a statement issued Sunday.

City leadership will continue to communicate and evaluate the COVID-19 situation to determine whether further actions should be taken in Mt. Juliet. Leaders will also monitor the compliance of Lee’s throughout the community.

The city of Lebanon declared a disaster emergency on Tuesday as a result of the novel coronavirus outbreak in Pennsylvania.

Lebanon has no confirmed cases of the virus yet, but officials are preparing for them, as the number of cases in Pennsylvania rises each day.

The disaster emergency declaration, signed by Mayor Sherry Capello, will allow the city to employe temporary workers, rent equipment purchase supplies and materials and take other actions to ""meet the emergency, all without regard to those time-consuming procedures and formalities normally prescribed by law, mandatory constituional requirements excepted.""

According to the declaration, Capello will cordinate the emergency response for Lebanon.

The Lebanon County commissioners issued a similar proclamation for the county yesterday. Both city and county officers are closed to the public.

Pennsylvania is under a state of emergency, and all ""non-essential"" businesses are being asked to close for a period of time in order to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

McGee has declared a state of emergency in the city of Lynn a week after Gov. Charlie Baker’s statewide emergency declaration, which gives city officials a “greater ability to respond to new developments,” according to a statement from the mayor’s office.

The move, which McGee said Monday was meant to “protect the general health, safety and well-being” of the city’s residents, is another step the city is taking to curb the potential spread of the coronavirus.

Nearby Swampscott announced its first “presumptive positive” case of COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus, on Monday, but Lynn has yet to be impacted. A Callahan Elementary School staff member reported last week she had been exposed to the virus, but school officials said she has not shown symptoms.

The emergency declaration followed McGee’s announcement late Sunday night that Lynn City Hall, the city’s Department of Public Works and the Lynn Public Library would be closed to the public until further notice.

The number of coronavirus cases in Massachusetts increased to 197 on Monday, an uptick from the 164 that were reported on Sunday, according to the state’s Department of Public Health.

“In light of this truly unparalleled situation, the city is taking these precautionary measures in order to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19 within our own community,” McGee said in a statement. “We are urging residents of all ages to regularly practice social distancing in groups of any size.”

Residents are strongly encouraged to conduct any City Hall business by phone or online, but should anticipate delays in response as city offices will be minimally staffed. Consideration should be given to delaying matters that are not time sensitive, according to McGee.

The mayor’s order to close city buildings, which came on the heels of statewide restrictions announced by the governor Sunday night, does not apply to emergency services, including the Lynn Police and Fire departments.

Following Baker’s announcement, the Lynn Public Schools will be closed until at least April 6. Parents are advised to have child care arrangements in place through April 17.

“Grab and go” lunches will be available for all youth in the city at four schools: Thurgood Marshall Middle School, Lynn Classical and English High schools, and Lynn Vocational Technical Institute. Students are encouraged to access school resources daily, which will be made available on the Lynn Public Schools website.

Baker announced Sunday he was closing all Massachusetts schools for at least the next three weeks and banning gatherings of more than 25 people.

The ban, which starts Tuesday, effectively closes the majority of public establishments and applies to churches, gyms, theaters and workplaces. Grocery stores and pharmacies won’t be impacted.

In addition, the CDC recommends that organizations that serve people who are at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness, such as older adults and those with chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease, cancel events for groups of 10 people or more, according to the mayor.

“As we work to mitigate this current public health emergency, we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding during this time,” said McGee. “The city will continue to discuss its approaches to meeting the needs of the public while keeping the health of everyone in mind.”

Residents are encouraged to take the following precautions to prevent a community spread of the coronavirus:

Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and dispose of any used material. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Stay home if you are sick and call your doctor.

At Wednesday’s special city commission meeting, they officially approved declaring the city in a state of emergency, in order to receive emergency FEMA funds during this disaster time.

Something special that the city is doing is suspending utility shut-offs, as there are many people who are unemployed currently, staying home with their children or have been laid off due to the virus. They are looking to help out those residents in this time of need.

RELATED: CORONAVIRUS BY COUNTY/CITY: Cases jump to 2,900, infant diagnosed in Santa Rosa

But the declaration did not come without controversy, with the council debating for nearly two hours to what extent they were allowed to impose restrictions on citizens to protect public health.

The state of emergency that ultimately passed does several things, including:

— Closing City Hall and encouraging all transactions to take place via the drive-thru window, and removing online payment fees to encourage online payments

— Giving law enforcement officers authority to break up groups of more than 10 people that gather in public places

— Strongly encouraging citizens to reduce movements to essential travel to provide food and care for loved ones, to obtain necessary items for the care and maintenance of the home or business, or for other necessary supplies

The declaration does not close public parks, does not impose a curfew and does not enforce a shelter-in-place order, though it does encourage citizens to restrict their movements to only necessary trips.

The local state of emergency allows the city to apply for state and federal financial aid to help recoup losses caused by the pandemic.

The vote came only a couple of hours after the Department of Health revealed that a 2-year-old Santa Rosa boy is one of four county residents to be confirmed positive for the coronavirus. In Escambia County, there were 10 confirmed cases, as of Tuesday morning.

Councilwoman Shannon Rice had several objections to the declaration, including words in the document directing citizens to ""comply"" and ""obey"" with necessary emergency orders.

Rice was also worried about a line that allowed ""all emergency authority for protection of the lives and property of the people of this city and continuity of government with a minimum of interruption,"" saying it would turn the city into a ""police state"" — something Police Chief Tony Tindell adamantly denied would happen.

""We’re not going to violate people’s rights,"" Tindell said, addressing the council. ""We’re here to serve and to protect, and that’s simply what we’re going to do.""

Tindell added that two of his officers were having to self-quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.

City of Milton attorney Eric Meade, who attended the meeting remotely via telephone, said words like ""comply,"" ""direct"" and ""obey"" were appropriate in the extraordinary circumstances.

""I would tend to agree in every other setting, but every citizen’s liberty is dependent upon not inflicting injury or harm upon any other citizen, and in this situation that has particular force,"" Meade said. ""Because it is precisely the gathering into groups of greater than (10 or more people) that constitutes a clear and present danger under these circumstances, where we have a contagion that is making its way through the population.""

Mayor Heather Lindsay said she believed certain words were necessary in the declaration to relay the correct tone during a time of crisis.

The state of emergency lasts through April 30.

The city of Milton voted Monday night to enact a local state of emergency, following the leads of other local municipalities that have taken action to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.

But the declaration did not come without controversy, with the council debating for nearly two hours to what extent they were allowed to impose restrictions on citizens to protect public health.

The state of emergency that ultimately passed does several things, including:

Closing City Hall and encouraging all transactions to take place via the drive-thru window, and removing online payment fees to encourage online payments

Giving law enforcement officers authority to break up groups of more than 10 people that gather in public places

Strongly encouraging citizens to reduce movements to essential travel to provide food and care for loved ones, to obtain necessary items for the care and maintenance of the home or business, or for other necessary supplies

The declaration does not close public parks, does not impose a curfew and does not enforce a shelter-in-place order, though it does encourage citizens to restrict their movements to only necessary trips.

Latest cases: Two-year-old confirmed with coronavirus in Santa Rosa County, Escambia County cases rise to 9

The local state of emergency allows the city to apply for state and federal financial aid to help recoup losses caused by the pandemic.

The vote came only a couple of hours after the Department of Health revealed that a 2-year-old Santa Rosa boy is one of four county residents to be confirmed positive for the coronavirus. In Escambia County, there were 10 confirmed cases, as of Tuesday morning.

Councilwoman Shannon Rice had several objections to the declaration, including words in the document directing citizens to “comply” and “obey” with necessary emergency orders.

Rice was also worried about a line that allowed “all emergency authority for protection of the lives and property of the people of this city and continuity of government with a minimum of interruption,” saying it would turn the city into a “police state” — something Police Chief Tony Tindell adamantly denied would happen.

“We’re not going to violate people’s rights,” Tindell said, addressing the council. “We’re here to serve and to protect, and that’s simply what we’re going to do.”

Tindell added that two of his officers were having to self-quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.

City of Milton attorney Eric Meade, who attended the meeting remotely via telephone, said words like “comply,” “direct” and “obey” were appropriate in the extraordinary circumstances.

“I would tend to agree in every other setting, but every citizen’s liberty is dependent upon not inflicting injury or harm upon any other citizen, and in this situation that has particular force,” Meade said. “Because it is precisely the gathering into groups of greater than (10 or more people) that constitutes a clear and present danger under these circumstances, where we have a contagion that is making its way through the population.”

Mayor Heather Lindsay said she believed certain words were necessary in the declaration to relay the correct tone during a time of crisis.

“I can’t help but think back to when I’m with my children and they were very young, and they don’t know all that could make them unsafe, and you are very direct with your child and you may be harsh even with your child if you think your child is unsafe and your child doesn’t know that,” Lindsay said. “It’s not our role to treat our citizens as children, but it is an analogy to correlate that when you’re in a state of emergency, there’s a different tone than when there’s not a state of emergency.”

Rice maintained her opposition to the declaration, and was the only council member who voted to oppose it. Councilwoman Peggi Smith was not in attendance.

""This is not the time to infringe on our citizens’ rights. People have died to defend these rights,"" Rice said. ""It’s not the time to hand over our city to the city manager, the police chief and the fire chief. We should stay involved, and that’s what I feel that this is doing. This is handing this city over to non-elected officials, and that is not what our citizens want.”

The state of emergency lasts through April 30.

“Declaring a State of Emergency is a measure being taken (to) protect the health and safety of our community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mayor Gordon Krantz. “My strongest message to residents is to stay home and only leave the house for essential items like food and medical needs. I urge everyone to continue practicing social distancing.”

The decision was made with the support of the mayor, council and the town’s crisis management team. It supports the region and province’s ongoing effort to “flatten the curve.”

Declaring a state of emergency gives the town the flexibility needed to manage the rapidly evolving situation through the implementation of public safety measures. The town is encouraging residents to continue self-isolation by not visiting friends and family; not organizing playdates for your children; or gathering in large groups in parks, sports courts or skate parks.

Teri Cunningham, a 51-year-old Milton man, died last Wednesday after being infected with novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. He had been admitted to Milton District Hospital a week earlier and was later transferred to Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital in Oakville.

The father of three had not travelled outside the country and had not come into contact with anyone known to been infected with COVID-19. It was the first coronavirus-related death in Halton Region, which has had 14 confirmed cases to date.

A man in his 40s was confirmed as Milton's second case on Monday. He is currently in self-isolation.

Krantz said residents can still remain connected safely while practising social distancing.

“During this difficult and uncertain time, I also encourage you to socially connect and pick up the phone to call, text and email friends and family members.”",state_of_emergency,460.0,39.7862,-85.1563

However, they said in a press release Thursday that cases are confirmed in neighboring Klamath and Washoe Counties.

The county officials said they worked closely with local medical service providers to determine that the potential of the virus is beyond the control of the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities of the county.

They state that they made the declaration due to the cost of supplies, planning, and preparation being beyond what the county can support.

Monterey County on Friday declared a local emergency related to the COVID-19 coronavirus — though no cases have been detected in Monterey County.

The move was a precautionary measure taken to activate and coordinate resources, county officials said Friday.

A health event in Gonzales and the Sea Otter Classic at Laguna Seca have also been postponed because of the coronavirus.

""After careful consideration, and although we are not experiencing any active cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community, nor in Monterey County, we have decided to take the precautionary measure of postponing the Community Summit that was scheduled for this Saturday, March 7th at Gonzales High School to a future date,"" the city wrote in a letter.

Coronavirus is highly contagious respiratory virus that has infected more than 100,000 across the globe, including 260 in the United States. California has treated 70 people for the disease, according to the New York Times.

They're among the latest events cancelled across the United States because of COVID-19. Austin's SXSW music, film and technology festival was cancelled Friday because of the coronavirus, which is spreading across the world.

In addition, the virus has led to two cruise ships' passengers being quarantined at sea, including the the Grand Princess anchored about 100 miles from Monterey Bay.

The U.S. Coast Guard flew test kits out to the ship Thursday. Of 46 people tested, 21 tested positive, according to USA Today.

Most infected people have mild symptoms, but its fatality rate has bounced between 2% an 3.4%.

That concerns health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because it could easily spread among vulnerable populations.

At least 14 people have died across in the United States and more than 3,200 have died across the world.

Tips to protect yourself and others from coronavirus

This map shows the countries that have reported Coronavirus infections (Photo: PROVIDED/CDC)

The CDC has created a website dedicated to COVID-19.

It says the following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.*

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath

The CDC offers these tips for preventing COVID-19:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Impact: Salinas Chinese restaurant business dips slightly amid coronavirus outbreak

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, according to the CDC. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.

People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately, the CDC advises.

The health ministry said the virus had been detected in a Moroccan man living in Italy who had returned to his home country.

The man's condition is not thought to be critical and is currently receiving treatment at a hospital in Casablanca.

The report comes a day after neighbouring Tunisia announced its first case of the virus.

The Tunisian man had also contracted it while in Italy, which has been one of the worst hit countries by the virus.

The number of deaths from the coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has reached 3,110 globally, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). Over 90,000 people have been infected worldwide since it first emerged in China's Hubei province in December.

In February, the WHO reported that 80 percent of COVID-19 cases report only mild, flu-like symptoms and that just 2 percent of cases have resulted in death.

Although vast majority of cases are in China; South Korea, Italy and Iran have emerged as the countries with the most cases outside the epicentre.

On Tuesday, it was reported that 23 Iranian MPs had tested positive for the the virus, days after suspending sessions.

According to BBC Persian, the lawmakers may have been infected due to their contact with their constituents across the country, which has reported the highest number of cases outside China, where the virus originated in January.

In total, 77 people have died and 2,336 have been infected by the coronavirus, Iran's Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi said in an announcement on state TV on Tuesday.

Saudi restricts GCC entrants

On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia announced it was barring citizens and residents of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries from entering the kingdom for 14 days after returning from outside the region due to coronavirus concerns, state news agency SPA reported.

Saudi Arabia reported its first case of coronavirus on Monday in a Saudi national returning from Iran, which has reported the most deaths outside China, where the flu-like disease originated.

The other GCC states have also diagnosed the infection in people who had visited Iran, totalling at least 141 cases.

Rabat – Morocco has declared a state of emergency in response to the growing threat of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.

The decision will come into effect starting tomorrow, March 20, at 6 p.m. until further notice. Morocco’s armed forces and police will enforce the new measures.

The state of emergency means that citizens cannot go out to public spaces without special authorization from local authorities.

Authorities will provide permission for people to buy groceries and medicines and for employees of necessary sectors, such as supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, gas stations, medical clinics, telecommunications, and essential freelance activities, to go to their workplaces.

A press release from the Ministry of Interior announced that the state of public health emergency “does not mean stopping the economy, but taking exceptional measures that require limiting the movement of citizens, by requiring that people can only leave their homes if they are provided with an official document from state officials, in some to specific cases.”

The statement added that these cases are “mobility to work for government departments and institutions, including companies, factories, agricultural works, shops and commercial spaces related to the daily living of the citizen, pharmacies, the banking sector, refueling stations, clinics and medical clinics, and agencies of telecommunications companies, necessary liberal professions, and shops selling cleaning supplies.”

The same source specified that mobility will be not limited to people who need to be present at the workplace provided that they are given a certificate signed by their supervisors.

Declaring a state of emergency allows governments to take more severe measures in responding to the epidemic, from freeing up budgets for improved medical care to imposing lockdowns on entire cities.

The US, Spain, Italy, Slovakia, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Bulgaria have all declared a state of emergency over the coronavirus pandemic.

Morocco’s declaration came shortly after the Ministry of Health confirmed the 63rd case of COVID-19 and follows the country’s unprecedented actions in taking preventative measures against the spread of the disease.

All international flights to and from Moroccan territory have been suspended until further notice.

Maritime routes between Morocco and Europe have been suspended, and all land borders are closed.

Restaurants, cafes, gyms, hammams (public baths), cinemas, and other gathering spaces are closed.

All public gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited, including economic and political meetings, cultural and religious festivities, and sporting events.

Beginning Monday, March 16, classes in all institutions—from daycares to universities, public to private—have been canceled until further notice.

The number of COVID-19 cases in Morocco tripled between Friday, March 13, and Thursday, March 19.

Out of 66 confirmed cases in the country, two patients have recovered and three have died.

On Thursday, March 12, Head of Government Saad Eddine El Othmani assured the public that Morocco is taking the pandemic very seriously and that all necessary measures will be taken at the appropriate time.

El Othmani and other officials including Minister of Health Khalid Ait Taleb have consistently maintained that the epidemiological development of COVID-19 in Morocco remains in its first phase, with all cases originating abroad or through contact with a person who became infected abroad.

However, Ait Taleb announced yesterday, March 18, that the Ministry of Health has detected local cases of the virus.

The head of government said on March 12 that the epidemic requires a response “with seriousness but without excess or panic to avoid harming the interests of citizens, the economy, and the country as a whole.”",state_of_emergency,1113.0,40.9445,-87.4503

What causes a recession and what are the signs? USA TODAY

MUNCIE, Ind. — Officials from Delaware County and the City of Muncie enacted a joint disaster emergency declaration Thursday, which will increase closures countywide due to the novel coronavirus and the authority local officials can use to enforce them.

According to a release from officials, the declaration was made in unison between the City of Muncie and Delaware County at the recommendation of the Delaware County Health Department.

""After declarations of a nationwide emergency, and the state of Indiana making an emergency declaration regarding COVID-19, the county health officer has determined that various measures need enacted to lessen the spread of COVID-19,"" the release reads.

City, county officials ordered these businesses to shut down

The declaration invokes Indiana state codes, which gives emergency authority to officials. All citizens are required to comply with necessary emergency measures, to cooperate with public officials and disaster services in executing emergency operation plans.

Based on the recommendation of the health department, all barbershops, hair salons, nail salons, tattoo parlors, gyms, recreational sports facilities or indoor play areas, private clubs and fraternal organizations will be closed to the public.

In addition, all county and city offices are now officially closed to the public. They can only be accessed by appointment only, with special rules for courts, as explained in the document.

As for the courts, those that have actual hearings or summons will be allowed to enter either the Delaware County Justice Center or City Hall.

Employees, residents must stay home if they show coronavirus symptoms

The declaration also enacts certain measures for employees and citizens to use caution, and to stay home if they exhibit symptoms of COVID-19. Employees should not return until they have been fever-free for more than 24 hours, only if they are not diagnosed with COVID-19.

“While these decisions were not easy to make by either party, the goal of this declaration is to protect the health and lives of the citizens in Delaware County and Muncie,” the release reads. “Now is the time to act, not out of fear, but out of compassion, to prevent the spread of this terrible illness.”

State and local officials are doing what they can to help, mayor says

Muncie Mayor Dan Ridenour said that all of the industries that are being closed require workers to get within a 6 foot area of a customer as part of the job. That puts people at risk.

“The public should take some comfort that the state and local officials are doing what is reasonable and helpful in helping slow down the spread of this virus,” Ridenour said.

While the economic strain isn’t ideal, the mayor stood by the fact that it’s the right thing to do at this point. Ridenour said that Delaware County was holding together better than others in the state in limiting the outbreak and that enacting these procedures would help with that. Other counties and cities across the state have taken similar measures in the last 48 hours.

Mayor's response: Ridenour: Muncie will do everything it can to help community cope with pandemic

If there will be further escalation beyond the declaration, only time will tell. The order stipulates that officials may implement stricter requirements in the future such as reducing work schedules, work-at-home rules and closing of non-emergency operations.

Ridenour said that discussions were ongoing every day with federal, state and local officials.

As of Monday afternoon, there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19, or coronavirus in Clark County, according to Clark County Combined Health District Commissioner Charles Patterson. COVID-19 is a respiratory condition marked by fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Symptoms can appear up to two weeks after exposure, according to health officials.

However, Patterson said that he believes that there are cases in the community that have not yet been tracked.

In order to take precautions and prevent the virus from potentially spreading in the area, New Carlisle has closed all city owned buildings to the public. The entry way to the City Administration Building will remain open due to the night deposit box, according to a news release sent from the city.

“Should the night deposit box be used to a pay a utility bill, please place your bill stub and payment method in the envelope (provided on sight) to ensure proper account credit,” the release said.

However, city officials are urging residents to pay those utility bills online at www.newcarlisle.net or have the funds automatically deducted from their bank accounts.

OAKLAND (CBS SF) — The Oakland City Council voted unanimously at a special meeting on Friday to approve an emergency ordinance imposing a moratorium on residential and commercial evictions, rent increases and late fees during the novel coronavirus epidemic.

The move by the City Council follows similar eviction moratoriums that have been passed by other local governments in the Bay Area in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.

COMPLETE COVERAGE: CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

Shortly before the council voted on the matter at about 1:30 p.m. on Friday following nearly two and a half hours of discussion, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order banning the eviction for renters affected by COVID-19 through May 31.

Newsom said his order prohibits landlords from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent and prohibits enforcement of evictions by law enforcement or courts.

Newsom said his action builds on a previous order he issued authorizing local governments to half evictions for renters impacted by the pandemic.

City Councilwoman Nikki Fortunato Bas, one of the sponsors of Oakland’s ordinance, said at Friday’s meeting that she welcomes Newsom’s order but added, “It’s still important to vote (on the ordinance) today because it addresses our specific needs in Oakland.”

City Council President Rebecca Kaplan said the eviction moratorium is important because, “I’ve talked to many people who are scared because they’ve been laid off and are in limbo.”

Kaplan continued: “They’re at great risk of losing the roofs over their heads because they can’t pay the rent. Tenants are still being served eviction notices and small businesses don’t know if they will survive this crisis.”

Oakland’s ordinance expires on May 31 unless it’s extended.",None,2490.0,38.3378,-87.3493
Oakland City,IN,03-12-2020 00:00,https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/03/12/oakland-city-council-declares-coronavirus-public-health-emergency/,Oakland City Council Declares Coronavirus Public Health Emergency,"OAKLAND (CBS SF) — The Oakland City Council voted unanimously on Thursday to approve a resolution confirming former City Administrator Sabrina Landreth’s declaration of a public health emergency on Monday because of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

The council’s action extends the emergency for up to another 60 days so the city can exercise emergency powers to address the coronavirus, which is also known as COVID-19.

Assistant City Administrator Ed Reiskin said the action will help the city acquire supplies and equipment to prevent the spread of the disease and seek reimbursement for the extra costs it expects to incur.

“This resolution is as much about preventing and preparing for the virus than for recovering from it. The public should not have cause for panic but cause for reassurance,” Reiskin said.

In a related matter concerning fears about the possible spreading of the virus at large public gatherings, many speakers at the meeting expressed concern about the large crowds of tenants, landlords, attorneys and court staff at eviction hearings at the Hayward Hall of Justice, where all such hearings in Alameda County are held.

Meghan Gordon, director and clinical supervisor of the housing practice at the East Bay Community Law Center, said crowds of 100 to 200 people often gather in close proximity in and outside the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Patrick McKinney, who holds the eviction hearings.

Gordon said the situation presents a public safety issue for all involved. But she said the problem exists because tenants and landlords need to appear in court to try to protect their rights.

Responding to the concerns that were expressed at the meeting, the City Council unanimously passed an emergency measure asking Alameda County Superior Court Presiding Judge Tara Desautels to delay all eviction hearings until April 7 for public safety reasons.

Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a letter to the City Council that in order to try to prevent the virus from spreading to homeless people, the city in partnership with Alameda County is nearly doubling the number of encampment sites, from 20 to 39, at which it will provide toilets, sanitizer and hand-washing stations.

Schaaf said the city also is providing additional hand sanitizers at the 20 encampments that already are serviced with toilets and hygiene.

In her letter, Schaaf wrote, “At present, we have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among our unsheltered population. We are taking major preventive steps, outline above, to help ensure that this remains the case.”

Schaaf said in the event of an infection or outbreak among the city’s homeless population, the city will immediately work with the Alameda County Public Health Department “to follow protocols, up to an including revisions to our encampment closure process, provide appropriate access to quarantine and treatment.”

Plainfield,IN,03-23-2020 19:38,https://patch.com/illinois/plainfield/plainfield-mayor-renews-emergency-declaration-coronavirus,Plainfield Mayor Renews Emergency Declaration For Coronavirus,"PLAINFIELD, IL — Last Monday, March 16, Plainfield Mayor Michael Collins issued a State of Emergency declaration for the village as the new coronavirus began spreading into Will County. The length of such declarations can vary, and in last week's case it was deemed necessary to last seven days. Now that those seven days have expired, village staff told Patch that the declaration is being renewed.

While saying that there are ""no new circumstances"" in Plainfield's current situation, village Community Relations Director Amy De Boni added that, ""the disaster declaration will continue to be renewed throughout the ongoing COVID-19 situation.""



This means that until such time as it is deemed no longer necessary, the emergency declaration will continue to be renewed every Monday.

Declarations of a State of Emergency allow municipalities like Plainfield to receive disaster-relief funds from FEMA should that become necessary, and to change certain protocols regarding how the village government operates. In this case, declaring an emergency allows the village to activate its emergency operations plan. According to Village Administrator Brian Murphy, this plan has multiple tiers related to the spread of coronavirus, with different actions to be taken as more cases of the virus appear in proximity to Plainfield. As of Monday afternoon, a total of 26 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Will County and four cases had been confirmed in Kendall County.

""As this virus finds its way through the Chicagoland area... we have differing levels of action plans,"" Murphy said last Monday. ""They run from it being just a federal and state issue - we know it's that already. As of this afternoon it has moved into being a regional issue... The next two levels are when there cases that make it into Plainfield and then finally... if we have cases within the [village government] itself.""



At present, the most drastic step the village has taken in its plans is to close all municipal facilities to the public. This step complements the 'stay at home' executive order handed down by Governor J.B. Pritzker on Saturday, asking all Illinoisans to stay home except for essential tasks. Murphy also said the next Plainfield village board meeting will likely make use of digital and teleconference technology, to limit the amount of time board trustees and meeting attendees spend together physically.

""It will be live, it may be streaming only on cable,"" Murphy said. ""It may be that we just have a conference call right here in [Village Hall] and people can listen in.""

2 Sri Lankan villages sealed off after positive coronavirus tests

Mnuchin says decision to reopen business will be health decision not economic

Fauci warns U.S. will have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths

More than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.

As the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.

The U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.

Fauci was speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union” as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.

Fauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged “it’s a little iffy there” right now.

With Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.

The White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.

The addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.

Sri Lanka seals off two villages

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.

The villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.

More than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.

Health before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.

Mnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.

But he says President Donald Trump’s top objective is the health of the American public.

Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.

He said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.

He said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.

Louisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed

WASHINGTON — Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state’s health care system.

Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week” that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.

He said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.

He made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.

Muscovites told to stay home

MOSCOW — The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.

A video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch’s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.

Non-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.

14-year-old boy dies in Portugal

LISBON, Portugal — The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.

Minister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.

Portugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.

Pelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn’t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The top Democrat in Congress says the government should be “taking every precaution” and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.

Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump’s “denial” early in the crisis was “deadly.”

She says: “As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.”

Pelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: “What did he know and when did he know it?”

Panama to allow cruise ships to use canal

PANAMA CITY — Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn’t immediately clear.

Holland America Line said via a Facebook post, “We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew” and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.

The Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.

Holland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.

Panamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.

50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations

MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.

Many of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

The Oak Park Village Board will vote Friday morning in a special meeting to expand the powers of its public health department director to respond to worries about the growing coronavirus threat.

Under the plan, Mike Charley, the longtime health department director, will have expanded authority, ranging from decisions on closing facilities, limiting the size of public gatherings to more mundane virus-mitigation actions, such as ordering supplies or equipment that would typically require village board approval.

""These are extraordinary times. We want to cut the red tape and empower our staff to make decisions,"" said Mayor Anan Abu-Taleb on Wednesday afternoon. ""We want to assure the public that we will always be forthcoming with any information we have and that we are taking this seriously.""

Abu-Taleb said that as of March 11, there were no known cases of infection in Oak Park.

""We are taking proactive actions,"" he said.

Cara Pavlicek, Oak Park village manager, said Tuesday that village government has been making internal policy changes since last week. Those range, she said, from following CDC protocol for cleaning voting machines in use during early voting at village hall, 123 Madison St., to placing quarantine restrictions on any employee who might be returning from a Level 3 country or any employee who might be returning from a cruise.

Additionally, village hall has suspended any employee travel through April 1. Village hall has also guaranteed that no employee will lose wages if they become sick with the virus and run out of sick leave.

Oak Park, said Abu-Taleb, is one of five municipalities in Cook County with its own public health department.

""This is a procedural step to allow Mike [Charley] to make decisions as he sees fit,"" said Abu-Taleb.

Pavlicek said the village board has the authority to rescind decisions it might disagree with.

Abu-Taleb said the village is in frequent communication with all local taxing bodies and will confer on all major decisions. But, he said, ""public safety issues tilt toward village hall.""

The expansion of health department authority had been expected to be approved at a village board meeting on Monday, March 16. The decision was made Wednesday to move more quickly and set a special meeting for Friday.

Things are getting quiet in Rockville Centre, at least in public. Schools are closed, meetings are postponed and most activities have come to a halt for at least the next couple of weeks. Though no cases of coronavirus have been reported in Rockville Centre, the village officials decided, “out of an abundance of caution” to close Village Hall, the Sandel Senior Center, John A. Anderson Recreation Center and Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Center for two weeks, starting Monday, March 16 and reopening on March 30.

""The Village of Rockville Centre has been in regular contact with local and state officials, as well as Health Department officials regarding the Coronavirus, known as COVID-19, to provide a coordinated response for our village,"" Mayor Francis X. Murray said. ""We are monitoring the situation closely and conferring with these experts as the ongoing situation warrants.

""With that in mind and out of an abundance of caution, I am declaring a state of emergency in the Village of Rockville Centre effective immediately,"" Murray continued. ""This declaration will allow the Village to more efficiently respond to the situation and potentially be reimbursed for costs associated with the pandemic.""

The village is shutting down all non-essential services for two weeks. All essential services, including the sanitation, electric, water, sewage, and police department. All other employees will be working remotely during this time.Residents who need to make electric and water payments, as well as pay for parking tickets, can pay online through the village's website. Payments can also be left in the drop box outside Village Hall or mailed to Village Court.

Additionally, the village has suspended parking enforcement for two weeks.

""This is not to encourage social gathering,"" Murray said, ""but to help patrons avoid touching meters and further spreading germs.""

While the decisions are necessary, people at all ages are affected. The Sandel Center serves as a social outlet for many of its members.

“As much as I hate to close the center, I believe it is the most responsible thing to do,” Sandel Center Executive Director Christina O’Leary said. “As the situation escalates...we feel it’s the best thing to protect our members, many of whom are in the high-risk brackets.”

Sharon Sheppard, assistant director of the MLK Center, said there are about 20-25 kids, ages 5-14, who participate in the free afterschool program. The closure will be an inconvenience for parents who rely on the center for child care while they work, forcing them to find alternative means of care.

“They’re not happy about it,” Sheppard said, “but they understand.”

Ginger Creegan, superintendent of the John A. Anderson Recreation Center, said that those who have signed up for classes during this time frame will be notified via email with information about possible make-up classes or reimbursement for missed classes. Staff members will be available to answer any questions at 516-678-9238 on Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the closure.

Murray stressed that closing of the facilities is an effort to minimize the effects of the virus on the community.

“We want to make sure we make the safest decisions possible to protect our residents and employees,” Murray said, “while maintaining service to our community.

“We will reevaluate the rapidly evolving situation at the end of the two weeks,” Murray added. “I am confident that as a community, we will weather these challenging times together.

The Rockville Centre Public Library is closed through March 29, and is expected to reopen on March 30. No fines will be charged during this time.

“As a precautionary measure, we are suspending all library programming, events and meetings for all ages,” director Catherine Overton said, noting that staff will heighten its cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces and advising patrons to also take steps to protect others.",state_of_emergency,4199.0,39.7665,-87.2295
Somerville,IN,03-16-2020 07:11,https://patch.com/massachusetts/somerville/somerville-declares-local-state-emergency-coronavirus,Somerville Declares Local State Of Emergency For Coronavirus,"SOMERVILLE, MA — Mayor Joseph Curtatone declared a local state of emergency in Somerville Sunday, building on Gov. Charlie Baker's order to close all bars and restaurants to on-site table service through April 17 and private schools through April 7. These measures are in place to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting interpersonal contact.

The formal declaration of a local state of emergency gives the city the ability to take decisive action to control the spread of coronavirus. It also creates a formal mechanism for the city to be reimbursed by the federal government for emergency response to this crisis.

Starting Tuesday, March 17, eateries will only be allowed to operate takeout and delivery services with safety and social distancing guidelines to help reduce potential transmission of the coronavirus. The city is working to eliminate any red tape that would prevent local restaurants that currently do not operate takeout and delivery services from adapting to such restrictions.

""We understand the devastating economic impact this may have on local residents and businesses,"" Curtatone said in a statement. ""We have more than 4,000 people working in the food service and accommodations industry in Somerville, so our community will be hit hard by these changes. We wish we could tell people that some semblance of normalcy could avoid the most dire consequences, but it was crucial for the Governor to take this step today. Unfortunately, the epidemiologists consulting with us are advising that social distancing is our only current defense against a mass contagion.""

The city is working with state and federal legislators to provide economic aid to the workers, families and small businesses impacted by these coronavirus-related closures.

Hatem MD, MPH has declared a State of Emergency for the City of Southport in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Southport Board of Aldermen have given the Mayor their unanimous support as noted by the vote at the special called board meeting Friday.

The entire resolution can be found on the city website.

Statement from the City of Southport

This Emergency Declaration demonstrates to the citizens of Southport, that city government is aware of the need to institute measures that would not be afforded unless this Declaration was enacted. This is done to protect our city in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic as the number of cases continue to rise and community spread will occur. We want to place rational prohibitions and restrictions that will limit exposure and mitigate spread. Southport has an at-risk older population and all hospitals are working with limited resources. This is why decreasing exposure, by removing dining in at our restaurants, canceling events, not allowing group interaction such as tours, and recommending staying at home except for work, essential shopping including take out from our restaurants, medical care, or a walk with social distancing. Again, practice social distancing, good hand washing, cleaning surfaces, if you are sick with fever, cough, short of breath, call your doctor or clinic for instructions.

Mayor Hatem maintains, “As we continue to face this “Invisible Hurricane” I want to assure every citizen that we are following guidelines from local, state and federal agencies and are in close contact with Brunswick County Public Health Officials and Emergency Management. We are a very social city and have enjoyed displaying our Southern Hospitality, but not in the age of the COVID-19 Pandemic.”",state_of_emergency,1763.0,39.66,-86.1171

The decisions by St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey come as the state’s number of COVID-19 cases grow with the Twin Cities metro at the epicenter.

On Monday, Minnesota confirmed 19 new cases of the novel coronavirus, for a statewide total of 54. Of those, Hennepin and Ramsey counties account for 32 of the cases.

By declaring local states of emergencies, the cities’ emergency management departments can request funding from and coordinate with other layers of government, including the counties, state and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.



On Monday afternoon, Frey issued a statement that said with the emergency declaration he will force bars, restaurants, nightclubs and coffee shops to close or limit their hours beginning Tuesday at noon. “Operations will be limited to delivery, takeout, and drive thru orders,” the statement said.

No further details on how, exactly, the city will monitor for compliance and enforce the new guidelines were immediately available.

Frey also said he’s coming up with a budget plan for stocking up on protective gear, such as masks and face masks, for city employees who are at risk of catching COVID-19.

“Our team will remain in constant communication with leadership in city hall and partners throughout Minnesota while we work to promote mitigation strategies, deliver core city services, and deploy resources where they are needed most,” Frey’s statement read.

St. Paul closes libraries, parks

About 19 hours before Frey’s announcement, on Sunday, Carter declared a state of emergency and announced the closure of St. Paul public libraries, parks and recreation facilities — including the Como Park Zoo and Conservatory — until Friday, March 27.

St. Paul’s firefighters and medics are in charge of helping people who show signs of COVID-19 — a fever, cough and shortness of breath — and need help getting to the hospital, according to the city. The city is preparing to provide compensation for emergency responders who contract the virus on duty and need to stay home to get better.

“I am grateful for Mayor Carter’s leadership during this challenging and historic moment in our history,” said St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell in a statement. “I am even more grateful and proud of our officers and first responders who simply don’t have the option of staying home during moments of crisis.”

St. Paul city staff are developing plans to keep essential services (water, public safety, etc.) in operation, help families during the statewide school closures beginning Wednesday and care for animals at the zoo when it’s not open to the public.



Much of Minneapolis and St. Paul’s emergency declarations have the same guidelines. For instance, both cities said, until further notice, they are no longer issuing new permits for gatherings of 50 or more people in accordance with public health officials’ guidelines for containing the virus.

Additionally, the mayors have suspended water shut-offs so residents can continue washing hands regularly, and they have asked their sheriff’s departments to stop issuing housing evictions until the outbreak subsides. That’s only a request — the respective sheriffs departments hold the discretion on whether or not to pause issuing evictions of residents.

Those moves, the mayors said, would help protect the cities’ most vulnerable residents.

“The impacts of COVID-19 stand to cause sudden and sharp drops in income for many tenants in our community,” Carter wrote in a letter to Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher.

Protections for workers

To protect staff and customers from the virus, many employers in Minneapolis and St. Paul have already closed their doors or come up with new ways to do business.

In Minneapolis, where all employers must offer paid sick leave to employees under a city ordinance, the closures have spurred confusion among workers over what pay they’re guaranteed, according to Brian Walsh, enforcement supervisor of the city’s labor standards division.

Under the city’s sick and safe time law, people who need to take off work to take care of their children because of the upcoming school closures can use accrued sick and safe time hours, according to Walsh.

Similarly, the city’s ordinance covers employees affected by Frey’s decision to close bars, restaurants, clubs and coffee shops, Walsh said.



But the rule does not cover workers unaffected by the emergency declaration, even if their managers told them not to come to work or shut down the business. In those cases, Walsh recommends people check out the state’s guidelines regarding unemployment insurance.

Unless those people seem sick: People who display symptoms of the virus may use any accrued sick and safe time hours to rest up, Walsh said. Also, the city’s ordinance protects workers who have “reason to believe they are probably infected” and feel they need to self-quarantine.

‘An extraordinary time’

In a statement Monday, Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender said she supports Frey’s decision to enact a state of emergency to prevent the spread of the novel virus.

She said the council will hold a special meeting on Thursday to vote on Frey’s declaration, which would solidify the city’s emergency status and allow for it to continue for as long as the state’s peacetime state of emergency lasts. Gov. Tim Walz issued that decision on Friday.

Even without the council’s approval, Frey’s emergency declaration remains in effect for three days.

As the situation evolves, Bender said city staff will brief the council regularly on the outbreak and how the latest developments could change what it’s like to live and work in Minneapolis.

“This is an extraordinary time,” she said, emphasizing the need for collaboration across city departments, businesses and neighborhoods. “I am working with my colleagues and Mayor Frey to center our commitments to race and economic equity in our response COVID-19.”

Monday’s announcement by Frey is a departure from his less-dramatic message on Friday, when he spoke publicly about the city’s response to COVID-19 for the first time.

To reporters and viewers of a Facebook Live video, he said the city’s core services would continue without interruption. But should non-essential employees have to work remotely or find other ways to do their jobs, he said departments were shoring up protections against cyber attacks and developing staffing contingency plans for first responders and 911 dispatchers.

“There is temptation to flip a switch, completely shut down, just ride it out for the next 30 to 60 days,” the mayor said Friday. “But public health research and quality emergency operations and planning tells us that it’s best not to take dramatic action without being based on solid rationale; it is better to gradually move up and eventually down a sliding scale or spectrum of actions.”",state_of_emergency,1061.0,39.4279,-85.6286

The declaration allows county or city officials to make decisions quickly about emergency actions that might be needed to help protect county residents and to allocate local resources where needed.

It also allows the county or city to access operational resources and funding from state and federal agencies. The President declared a national state of emergency on March 13, 2020, and Governor Northam declared a state of emergency for the Commonwealth of Virginia on March 12.

Augusta County leaders say they've been coordinating closely with Waynesboro and Staunton leaders to share information and resources.

The moves by Augusta County and Staunton follow Harrisonburg's declaration over the weekend.

While there has been one positive test for COVID-19 in a Harrisonburg patient and one positive test across the mountain in Charlottesville among the UVA community, at this point, there have been no confirmed cases in Augusta County, Staunton, or Waynesboro.

However, local governments are making these moves to prevent further spread of the virus and ""flatten the curve"" of transmission.

Below are aspects of the county and the city affected by the declarations:

The Augusta County Government Center

Augusta County has cancelled public use of the government center for meeting spaces until further notice and limited access to the building to only essential business that can't be accomplished online, over the phone, or through the mail.

Universal,IN,03-25-2020 00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/25/coronavirus-patients-do-not-resucitate/,Hospitals consider universal do-not-resuscitate orders for coronavirus patients,"The conversations are driven by the realization that the risk to staff amid dwindling stores of protective equipment — such as masks, gowns and gloves — may be too great to justify the conventional response when a patient “codes,” and their heart or breathing stops.

Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago has been discussing a do-not-resuscitate policy for infected patients, regardless of the wishes of the patient or their family members — a wrenching decision to prioritize the lives of the many over the one.

AD

AD

Richard Wunderink, one of Northwestern’s intensive-care medical directors, said hospital administrators would have to ask Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for help in clarifying state law and whether it permits the policy shift.

“It’s a major concern for everyone,” he said. “This is something about which we have had lots of communication with families, and I think they are very aware of the grave circumstances.”

Officials at George Washington University Hospital in the District say they have had similar conversations, but for now will continue to resuscitate covid-19 patients using modified procedures, such as putting plastic sheeting over the patient to create a barrier. The University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, one of the country’s major hot spots for infections, is dealing with the problem by severely limiting the number of responders to a contagious patient in cardiac or respiratory arrest.

AD

AD

Several large hospital systems — Atrium Health in the Carolinas, Geisinger in Pennsylvania and regional Kaiser Permanente networks — are looking at guidelines that would allow doctors to override the wishes of the coronavirus patient or family members on a case-by-case basis due to the risk to doctors and nurses, or a shortage of protective equipment, say ethicists and doctors involved in those conversations. But they would stop short of imposing a do-not-resuscitate order on every coronavirus patient. The companies declined to comment.

Lewis Kaplan, president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and a University of Pennsylvania surgeon, described how colleagues at different institutions are sharing draft policies to address their changed reality.

“We are now on crisis footing,” he said. “What you take as first-come, first-served, no-holds-barred, everything-that-is-available-should-be-applied medicine is not where we are. We are now facing some difficult choices in how we apply medical resources — including staff.”

AD

AD

The new protocols are part of a larger rationing of lifesaving procedures and equipment — including ventilators — that is quickly becoming a reality here as in other parts of the world battling the virus. The concerns are not just about health-care workers getting sick but also about them potentially carrying the virus to other patients in the hospital.

R. Alta Charo, a University of Wisconsin-Madison bioethicist, said that while the idea of withholding treatments may be unsettling, especially in a country as wealthy as ours, it is pragmatic. “It doesn’t help anybody if our doctors and nurses are felled by this virus and not able to care for us,” she said. “The code process is one that puts them at an enhanced risk.”

Wunderink said all of the most critically ill patients in the 12 days since they had their first coronavirus case have experienced steady declines rather than a sudden crash. That allowed medical staff to talk with families about the risk to workers and how having to put on protective gear delays a response and decreases the chance of saving someone’s life.

AD

AD

A consequence of those conversations, he said, is that many family members are making the difficult choice to sign do-not-resuscitate orders.

Code blue

Health-care providers are bound by oath — and in some states, by law — to do everything they can within the bounds of modern technology to save a patient’s life, absent an order, such as a DNR, to do otherwise. But as cases mount amid a national shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE, hospitals are beginning to implement emergency measures that will either minimize, modify or completely stop the use of certain procedures on patients with covid-19.

Some of the most anxiety-provoking minutes in a health-care worker’s day involve participating in procedures that send virus-laced droplets from a patient’s airways all over the room.

AD

These include endoscopies, bronchoscopies and other procedures in which tubes or cameras are sent down the throat and are routine in ICUs to look for bleeds or examine the inside of the lungs.

AD

Changing or eliminating those protocols is likely to decrease some patients’ chances for survival. But hospital administrators and doctors say the measures are necessary to save the most lives.

The most extreme of these situations is when a patient, in hospital lingo, “codes.”

When a code blue alarm is activated, it signals that a patient has gone into cardiopulmonary arrest and typically all available personnel — usually somewhere around eight but sometimes as many as 30 people — rush into the room to begin live-saving procedures without which the person would almost certainly perish.

AD

“It’s extremely dangerous in terms of infection risk because it involves multiple bodily fluids,” explained one ICU physician in the Midwest, who did not want her name used because she was not authorized to speak by her hospital.

AD

Fred Wyese, an ICU nurse in Muskegon, Mich., describes it like a storm:

A team of nurses and doctors, trading off every two minutes, begin the chest compressions that are part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR. Someone punctures the neck and arms to access blood vessels to put in new intravenous lines. Someone else grabs a “crash cart” stocked with a variety of lifesaving medications and equipment ranging from epinephrine injectors to a defibrillator to restart the heart.

AD

As soon as possible, a breathing tube will be placed down the throat and the person will be hooked up to a mechanical ventilator. Even in the best of times, a patient who is coding presents an ethical maze; there’s often no clear cut answer for when there’s still hope and when it’s too late.

In the process, heaps of protective equipment is used — often many dozens of gloves, gowns, masks, and more.

AD

Bruno Petinaux, chief medical officer at George Washington University Hospital, said the hospital has had a lot of discussion about how — and whether — to resuscitate covid-19 patients who are coding.

“From a safety perspective you can make the argument that the safest thing is to do nothing,” he said. “I don’t believe that is necessarily the right approach. So we have decided not to go in that direction. What we are doing is what can be done safely.”

AD

However, he said, the decision comes down to a hospital’s resources and “every hospital has to assess and evaluate for themselves.” It’s still early in the outbreak in the Washington area, and GW still has sufficient equipment and manpower. Petinaux said he cannot rule out a change in protocol if things get worse.

GW’s procedure for responding to coronavirus patients who are coding includes using a machine called a Lucas device, which looks like a bumper, to deliver chest compressions. But the hospital has only two. If the Lucas devices are not readily accessible, doctors and nurses have been told to drape plastic sheeting — the 7-mil kind available at Home Depot or Lowe’s — over the patient’s body to minimize the spread of droplets and then proceed with chest compressions. Because the patient would presumably be on a ventilator, there is no risk of suffocation.

AD

In Washington state which had the nation’s first covid-19 cases, UW Medicine’s chief medical officer, Tim Dellit, said the decision to send in fewer doctors and nurses to help a coding patient is about “minimizing use of PPE as we go into the surge.” He said the hospital is monitoring health-care workers’ health closely. So far, the percentage of infections among those tested is less than in the general population, which, he hopes, means their precautions are working.

'It is a nightmare’

Bioethicist Scott Halpern at the University of Pennsylvania is the author of one widely circulated model guideline being considered by many hospitals. In an interview, he said a blanket stop to resuscitations for infected patients is too “draconian” and may end up sacrificing a young person who is otherwise in good health. However, health-care workers and limited protective equipment cannot be ignored.

“If we risk their well-being in service of one patient, we detract from the care of future patients, which is unfair,” he said.

Halpern’s document calls for two physicians, the one directly taking care of a patient and one who is not, to sign off on do-not-resuscitate orders. They must document the reason for the decision, and the family must be informed but does not have to agree.

Wyese, the Michigan ICU nurse, said his own hospital has been thinking about these issues for years but still is unprepared.

“They made us do all kinds of mandatory education and fittings and made it sound like they are prepared,” he said. “But when it hits the fan, they don’t have the supplies so the plans they had in place aren’t working.”

Over the weekend, Wyese said, a suspected covid-19 patient was rushed in and put into a negative pressure room to prevent the virus spread. In normal times, a nurse in full hazmat-type gear would sit with the patient to care for him, but there was little equipment to spare. So Wyese had to monitor him from the outside. Before he walked inside, he said, he would have to put on a face shield, N95 mask, and other equipment and slather antibacterial foam on his bald head as the hospital did not have any more head coverings. Only one powered air-purifying respirator or PAPR was available for the room and others nearby that could be used when performing an invasive procedure — but it was 150 feet away.

While he said his hospital’s policy still called for a full response to patients whose heart or breathing stopped, he worried any efforts would be challenging, if not futile.

“By the time you get all gowned up and double-gloved the patient is going to be dead,” he said. “We are going to be coding dead people. It is a nightmare.”",None,344.0,39.6226,-87.4554

Fauci warns U.S. will have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths

More than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.

As the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.

The U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.

Fauci was speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union” as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.

Fauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged “it’s a little iffy there” right now.

With Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.

The White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.

The addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.

Sri Lanka seals off two villages

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.

The villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.

More than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.

Health before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.

Mnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.

But he says President Donald Trump’s top objective is the health of the American public.

Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.

He said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.

He said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.

Louisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed

WASHINGTON — Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state’s health care system.

Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week” that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.

He said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.

He made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.

Pelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn’t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The top Democrat in Congress says the government should be “taking every precaution” and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.

Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump’s “denial” early in the crisis was “deadly.”

She says: “As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.”

Pelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: “What did he know and when did he know it?”

The Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn’t immediately clear.

Holland America Line said via a Facebook post, “We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew” and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.

The Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.

Holland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.

Panamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.

50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations

MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.

Many of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

The Warren County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday took action to access state aid and extend the closure of Warren County buildings for the COVID-19 pandemic indefinitely.

The supervisors, chair Aaron DeKock, Crystal McIntyre and Doug Shull, voted unanimously for an official disaster declaration for the county for the COVID-19 outbreak and to close the county buildings including the administration building to the public indefinitely during a special meeting on Wednesday.

Warren County Emergency Management coordinator Troy Bass said the emergency declaration will open the door to state aid including needed personal protective equipment for first responders including firefighters, EMS personnel and police and sheriff officers. The declaration will also help nursing homes and daycare providers obtain protective supplies.

Bass said the supply of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 virus outbreak has become ""dangerously low"" in the county as the need continues to increase. He urged any business or company which may have access to supplies of personal protective equipment to contact Warren County Health Services.

The disaster declaration will also open up state assistance avenues for low income individuals and small businesses.

The closure of Warren County buildings and offices to the general public has also been extended indefinitely. DeKock said the county will look to lift the closure of the buildings at the time Warren County's school districts reopen, which is currently set for April 13 but may change in the future.

All Warren County buildings, including the administration building, will remain closed to the general public, but county workers will still be available by telephone, email and appointment.

Warren County public health director Jodene DeVault said the closures are needed to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

""We still should be doing some very significant social distancing,"" DeVault said.

The first positive case of COVID-19 in Warren County was reported Tuesday. A member of the Norwalk schools district central office tested positive for the virus which causes COVID-19. DeVault said there are likely more cases in the county but determining a more exact number is difficult because of a shortage of supplies and a five to six day wait for results.

Washington,IN,03-29-2020 00:00,https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2020/03/29/coronavirus-dc-maryland-virginia-updates/,Trump declares D.C. a ‘major disaster’ area; Washington region reports 16 new coronavirus deaths,"Advocates in the District, Maryland and Virginia are calling on officials to swiftly release as many prisoners as possible to prevent an outbreak of coronavirus in the region’s jail cells.

Officials with the District’s Public Defender Service on Saturday issued a statement calling for the release of eligible D.C. jail inmates following reports that four prisoners had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. Days before, groups including the Maryland Prisoners’ Rights Coalition wrote to Gov. Larry Hogan (R) urging him to expedite the release of prisoners whose sentences will soon expire, as well as those serving short sentences.

On Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia plans to send a similar letter to Gov. Ralph Northam (D) demanding he reduce prisoner intake, free those whose sentences are due to end next year and release “vulnerable people” — meaning the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. As of Sunday afternoon, no virus cases had been reported in Maryland or Virginia jails.

“ Carceral facilities make social distancing impossible and are not built or prepared to fulfill the medical needs associated with covid-19,” the illness caused by the virus, Virginia ACLU executive director Claire G. Gastañaga wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The Washington Post.

It is a problem facing jails nationwide, as the virus continues its steady march of infection across the country. Health officials have warned that cells — which house so many people, so close together — essentially function as perfect incubators for the virus. Over the past two weeks, with detention facilities throughout the country beginning to report their first cases, some state and local officials have responded by freeing inmates early and encouraging fewer arrests.

The Public Defender Service has been concerned for a while that conditions at the D.C. jail would foster the spread of the virus, the service’s special counsel Janet Mitchell said Sunday.

“We see cautionary tales from other jurisdictions and want to avoid being the next Rikers,” Mitchell said, referring to the New York jail where dozens have tested positive. “We are asking all the stakeholders to take action now and to start releasing as many persons as possible as quickly as possible.”

Mitchell suggested setting free “at minimum” those who are serving misdemeanor sentences, or awaiting trial on misdemeanors. She also urged judges who previously denied bond review motions — citing the then-absence of coronavirus cases within D.C. jails — to reverse their decisions.

Authorities announced the diagnosis of the first reported case in the District’s jail system, a 20-year-old, on Wednesday. Two days later, authorities said that a 44-year-old man housed in the Correctional Treatment Facility — the same facility that held the 20-year-old, although the two inmates were not in the same unit — had also tested positive.

Late Saturday, jail officials announced the diagnosis of two more inmates, a 37-year-old and a 38-year-old both housed in the same treatment facility as the first two patients. The 37-year-old and 38-year-old are being treated and have been isolated from other inmates, according to Department of Corrections spokeswoman Keena Black.

In the letter to Northam — which also included a draft of an executive order he could sign, fulfilling activists’ requests — Gastañaga noted that the spread of the virus in the state’s jail system would disproportionately affect people of color, who are overrepresented in America’s prisons. Black people make up 19 percent of Virginia’s overall population, she wrote, but 58 percent of the state’s incarcerated population.

Making matters worse, Gastañaga wrote, people of color are also more likely to suffer from diabetes, heart disease and respiratory disease, all conditions that health officials believe increase an individual’s risk of contracting and dying from coronavirus.

If the virus finds its way into the state’s jail system, she warned, the consequences will be horrifying.

“The time for action is now,” Gastañaga wrote. “This pandemic is here, and it will — if it hasn’t already — make its way into our custodial facilities.”

Waterloo City Council members voted unanimously Thursday to update the city’s ordinance giving broader powers to the mayor during a “civil emergency.”

“We’ve already seen a number of other communities move to this across the state,” said Mayor Quentin Hart, who immediately issued an emergency proclamation as the threat of a COVID-19 pandemic grows.

Several other mayors across the state had declared civil emergencies in their community, but Waterloo’s previous ordinance did not include a public health threat as a reason for declaring a civil emergency.

“We felt it was necessary to broaden the definition of a civil emergency in the city of Waterloo,” said City Clerk Kelley Felchle. “We’ve made some additions to include, obviously, a health crisis, a cyber attack, acts of terrorism, things that fit a little bit more with our modern times.”

Mayors for area cities (Kitchener, Cambridge and Waterloo) and townships (North Dumfries, Wellesley, Wilmot and Woolwich) joined Regional Chair Karen Redman in signing declarations on Wednesday morning.

In a release, the region and municipalities say this will allow Redman and the mayors “to take actions or make orders to protect the inhabitants of the municipality and increases the ability of municipalities to share resources, personnel and equipment to respond and support the broader public sector and key services.”

Redman says the states of emergency will remain in place until they are lifted by the heads of government.

“This stays in place until I as chair, revoke it for the region and it would be the same for the individual municipalities as well,” Redman said.

She said that move is quite open-ended in terms of the powers it grants to local leaders.

As an example, Redman said, “quite literally, we could enlist bylaw officers to go around and make sure that people are adhering to staying in their homes and practising physical distancing.

“People who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, are indeed self-isolating.”

The regional chair explained that the order states ”such actions or orders that he or she considers necessary that are not contrary to the law and implement a regional emergency response plan.”

She says that part of the reason the community leaders chose to declare a state of emergency on Wednesday was in an attempt to make some people aware of how serious the pandemic is.

“I would tell you that part of this is getting the community’s attention so that everybody is taking the lead of public health and Dr. Wang in following her directions,” Redman explained.

She said they are also trying to make travellers returning to Canada aware of how important it is to self-isolate.

“Quite honestly, this is quite a pivotal period of time in the next couple of weeks,” she said. “If we’re able to practice the directives, the social isolation and physical distancing, we can help flatten the curve at this is a crucial time when that behaviour will make an absolute difference over the long run.”

Kitchener Mayor Berry Vrbanovic said there were other practical reasons to invoke the states of emergency.

“While the province has made it absolutely clear that any decisions they’re making right now, they will include the funding for municipalities without having to declare an emergency in the event that that changes either with the province or the federal government,” he said. “This starts a clock ticking where we can also start looking at what some of those expenses are going to be that might potentially be eligible in the future for more funding.”

Vrbanovic also said the move will allow more support for volunteers when they are called upon.

“As we move forward in the coming weeks, it’s going to become increasingly likely we’re going to need to be turning to more community volunteers,” the Kitchener mayor said. “It will do things like giving them WSIB coverage.”

Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know:

Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are asked to self-isolate for 14 days in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others.

Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing — very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.

To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

The announcement came during a news conference in Portland featuring state and county officials, where Gov. Kate Brown also announced restrictions on statewide gatherings and other provisions to slow virus infections. Oregon has 21 known cases of COVID-19 as of Thursday.

Wheeler said the declaration allows the city “additional authority to properly address the threat of infection and harm,” which the city charter says could include setting curfews, regulating the sale of certain items, enforcing rent control, limiting how many people can gather and ordering evacuations.

It is slated to remain in effect until March 26.

[Read the state of emergency declaration]

Wheeler said the city will explain specific actions it’ll take in connection with the declaration in the coming days. The city has the option of extending the state of emergency.

A Portland City Council meeting scheduled for Thursday afternoon was cancelled as a precaution.

Wheeler said the city will continue to provide water, sewer and stormwater services to residents during the state of emergency regardless of whether they can pay their bills. He said the city will work to help small and large businesses recoup losses from cancelled events and loss of sales.

Non-essential city gatherings have been cancelled or postponed to protect city employees and visitors, and the city will also stop city employee non-mandatory traveling for meetings or conferences, the mayor said. He said the city will encourage more teleconferencing and urge “vulnerable employees to stay home for as long as they need too.”

The mayor said a city task force will be established to come up with other ideas to address economic losses related to coronavirus.

Wheeler also reiterated city actions announced during a council meeting Wednesday: the city will keep winter shelters open for the homeless population, provide motel vouchers to people staying in shelters who show symptoms of the virus or are 60 or older with pre-existing health conditions, and distribute portable toilets and hand washing stations throughout the city.

He said the virus has caused Portland nonprofits to cancel yearly fundraisers, impacted arts and cultural institutions and put people at risk of being laid off.

“Portlanders have always looked out for each other, but now I’m asking you, particularly at this time, to help your neighbors who might need help,” Wheeler said.

The Portland Water Bureau urges anyone facing financial hardship over the next two weeks in paying their water utility bills to call their customer service line at 503-823-7770.

Mnuchin says decision to reopen business will be health decision not economic

Fauci warns U.S. will have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths

More than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.

As the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.

The U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.

Fauci was speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union” as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.

Fauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged “it’s a little iffy there” right now.

With Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.

The White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.

The addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.

Sri Lanka seals off two villages

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.

The villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.

More than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.

Health before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.

Mnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.

But he says President Donald Trump’s top objective is the health of the American public.

Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.

He said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.

He said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.

Louisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed

WASHINGTON — Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state’s health care system.

Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week” that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.

He said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.

He made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.

Muscovites told to stay home

MOSCOW — The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.

A video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch’s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.

Non-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.

14-year-old boy dies in Portugal

LISBON, Portugal — The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.

Minister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.

Portugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.

Pelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn’t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The top Democrat in Congress says the government should be “taking every precaution” and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.

Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump’s “denial” early in the crisis was “deadly.”

She says: “As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.”

Pelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: “What did he know and when did he know it?”

Panama to allow cruise ships to use canal

PANAMA CITY — Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn’t immediately clear.

Holland America Line said via a Facebook post, “We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew” and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.

The Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.

Holland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.

Panamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.

50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations

MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.

Many of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

City responds to outbreak, closes public library, aquatic center through April 1

The Woodburn City Council declared a state of emergency Monday in response to the continued spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

Councilors and Mayor Eric Swenson met in a special meeting at noon, approving a resolution ratifying and administrative order that declares ""an emergency exists within the city as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,"" according to the city's Facebook page.

""City officials have been monitoring the national COVID-19 emergency and taking actions to mitigate the virus' impact on the community,"" said City Administrator Scott Derickson. ""Protecting the health and safety of Woodburn is a top priority. Declaring a local emergency better positions City Hall to be more flexible and responsive to the needs of our community, both today and moving forward through the pandemic.""

Since Gov. Kate Brown announced on Wednesday, March 11 a ban on public gatherings of 250 or more people for four weeks and followed with a Thursday proclimation closing schools statewide through Wednesday, April 1, the city of Woodburn has canceled all library and Park and Recreation activities through at least April 15.

Likewise, the Woodburn Public Library and Woodburn Aquatic Center closed Saturday, March 14, and will remain shuttered through at least April 1, pending a decision to reopen the facilities that will be re-evaluted during the closure.

Since the closures, Swenson has addressed community members through video and in this week's issue of the Woodburn Independent, urging people to stay safe and calm over the coming weeks.

""As with any emergency, the most important things we can all do are to remain calm, understand the facts, not repeat rumors, proceed carefully and take the advice of professionals seriously,"" Swenson said in a video address posted Thursday, March 12.

To encourage people to practice social distancing, Swenson and the city encourages community members to avoid City Hall unless necessary, paying bills online, by phone or by dropping off payments outside City Hall.

Swenson also cautioned citizens to stay alert in the face of opportunistic scams during the closures seeking to take advantage of the crisis.

""Because too often fear replaces calm and clouds our judgment, please remember to be careful about scams that will come by telephone or through the Internet trying to take advantage of that fear,"" he said.

""Our community...has weathered many health-related crises throughout our history and we will this one as well,"" Swenson said. ""Like every virus, this one will run its course.

The city of Woodburn is closing library and aquatic center through April 1, asking people to pay water bills by phone, online or via drop box

The president, the governor and the Woodburn City Council have all declared a state of emergency in response to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19. At this stage of the pandemic it is our hope that it is more accurate to say that we are in a state of preventing an emergency.

It is important to be reminded that the most important things to do in any emergency are to remain calm, not panic, understand the facts, stay informed, proceed with caution and take the advice of those most knowledgeable.

It is clear that the Oregon Health Authority, working with Oregon cities and counties, is providing that leadership with facts and updates that you can access directly at the City of Woodburn's web page: www.woodburn-or.gov/health.

There you will learn that the novel coronavirus and influenza have similar symptoms that include high fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Influenza, still circulating in Oregon, is a much more likely cause of fever and cough than coronavirus, but it is important to contact your health provider by phone if you have any concerns or questions. In addition you can dial 211 (and not 911) if you have questions or would like more information about the coronavirus.

The city has taken the precautions of closing our library and aquatic center through April 1 and asking people to pay their water bills online, by phone or in the drop box outside City Hall. Please access the City's web and facebook pages for updates about all city services.

In moments of heightened concern like this, when we are likely more worried about our health and the health of our loved ones, and the world around us seems cattywampus like my father used to say, we can also take this moment to slow down and appreciate those around us more.

With the cancellation of nearly all activities, at the precise moment when we have less we have to do, there is less to do. As we spend more time at home without rushing off to the activity that's now canceled, maybe we'll eventually become bored with whatever is on our screens and turn our attention to those we live with. And maybe we'll even take a walk around the neighborhood and wave at our neighbors that we never see and talk with them - from six feet away.

While the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus is still very small, and the likelihood of surviving it if contracted is still very high, there is cause for concern. As we take those precautions seriously let us not be overtaken by fear. Too often fear replaces calm and then clouds our judgment and we are prone to rumors, scams and divisive conspiracy theories. When that happens, we should hear Franklin Roosevelt's words on the subject and answer that fear with reason.

Speaking of reason, as your mayor I have preached the need for all of us to be prepared in the case of a natural disaster, like an earthquake, by stocking up on key items - and this is an appropriate time for that. Having said that, please leave some toilet paper on the shelves for your neighbors.

Like every virus, this one will run its course. Our country and our community have weathered many health related crisis throughout our history, and by remaining calm, staying informed and taking precautions we will weather this one as well.",None,1603.0,41.1287,-84.8503

OELWEIN, Ia. — Severe storms damaged an apartment building in northeast Iowa Saturday night and knocked down power lines in the area.

A tornado that was spotted in Oelwein, Iowa, tore off part of the wall of a 12-unit apartment building and damaged the siding of a second building in the complex. Oelwein police said no serious injuries were reported.

Lonnie Robbins said he watched the storm moving in before retreating to the bathroom of his ground-floor apartment in the complex.

""I heard something go whoosh, and I even felt it,"" Robbins told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. ""It ripped the hallway wall off, smacked that into my apartment, and when it did that, it knocked a hole in my apartment.""

Fayette County Sheriff Marty Fisher said the storm knocked down branches and some power lines elsewhere in Oelwein and in rural parts of the county.

Residents of the apartment complex whose homes were damaged sought shelter in a nearby hotel. Resident Jonathan Reinert said the storm damage leaves him without a place to stay during the coronavirus outbreak. Emergency crews wore surgical masks as they responded to the storm damage because of the virus.

""I got no shelter in place now,"" Reinert said.

This has forced the public colleges in Iowa to announce they are closing down in-class schooling until at least 2 weeks after spring break. Reported by Radio Iowa, UNI Provost Jim Wohlpart says it was the right choice with everything considered.

When this story dropped, North Iowa area schools were forced to convene and decide if they would follow the lead of UNI, Iowa, and Iowa State by cancelling classes as well.

On the high school level, Osage Superintendent Barb Schwamman released a statement on March 11th that assured locals the school would still be conducting normal classes, saying:

“In the event that Mitchell County Health Department or the Iowa Department of Public Health determines that there is a need for closure, or other action, we will communicate additional information at that time.”

On March 10th, NIACC’s President Steve Schultz said his team would be meeting very soon to talk about the next steps needing to be done – but was yet to suspend in person classes. Schultz admitted this could change in an instant.

And it did.

Following the March 16-20th spring break for NIACC, face-to-face classes are being rerouted to the inter-web. Some select labs will still meet in class.

Fauci warns U.S. will have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths

More than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.

As the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.

The U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.

Fauci was speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union” as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.

Fauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged “it’s a little iffy there” right now.

With Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.

The White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.

The addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.

Sri Lanka seals off two villages

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.

The villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.

More than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.

Health before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.

Mnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.

But he says President Donald Trump’s top objective is the health of the American public.

Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.

He said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.

He said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.

Louisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed

WASHINGTON — Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state’s health care system.

Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week” that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.

He said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.

He made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.

Muscovites told to stay home

MOSCOW — The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.

A video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch’s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.

Non-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.

14-year-old boy dies in Portugal

LISBON, Portugal — The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.

Minister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.

Portugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.

Pelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn’t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The top Democrat in Congress says the government should be “taking every precaution” and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.

Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump’s “denial” early in the crisis was “deadly.”

She says: “As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.”

Pelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: “What did he know and when did he know it?”

Panama to allow cruise ships to use canal

PANAMA CITY — Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn’t immediately clear.

Holland America Line said via a Facebook post, “We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew” and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.

The Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.

Holland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.

Panamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.

50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations

MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.

Many of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

Waterloo City Council members voted unanimously Thursday to update the city’s ordinance giving broader powers to the mayor during a “civil emergency.”

“We’ve already seen a number of other communities move to this across the state,” said Mayor Quentin Hart, who immediately issued an emergency proclamation as the threat of a COVID-19 pandemic grows.

Several other mayors across the state had declared civil emergencies in their community, but Waterloo’s previous ordinance did not include a public health threat as a reason for declaring a civil emergency.

“We felt it was necessary to broaden the definition of a civil emergency in the city of Waterloo,” said City Clerk Kelley Felchle. “We’ve made some additions to include, obviously, a health crisis, a cyber attack, acts of terrorism, things that fit a little bit more with our modern times.”

Rock and Roll Hall of Famers Yes have canceled a handful of U.S. concerts, including a March 22 date at Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, due to concerns over COVID-19, or coronavirus.

The band has also canceled its appearance on the 2020 Cruise to the Edge, slated to depart Miami on March 27.

“Much to our disappointment but with an abundance of consideration and caution, Yes has canceled its performances in the Southeast this spring and withdrawn from the shows on ‘Cruise to the Edge’ for reasons beyond our control,” drummer Alan White said in a statement. “It is unfortunate timing for everyone. We sincerely hope that all involved will realize the last thing the band ever wants to do is to let down their audiences. We believe it is a prudent decision based on many variables and external factors.”

Added guitarist Steve Howe: “Running a relatively large show aided by our 12-piece crew and full production requires insurance coverage, which is currently unavailable to us for a variety of reasons beyond our control. ... It’s become impossible to predict what will happen in the near future, but we look forward to seeing you all very soon.”

The Ruth Eckerd Hall show was also scheduled to feature the Alan Parsons Project. And it turns out Parsons is sticking with the Clearwater date. Joining him on March 22 will be Robby Steinhardt, performing the music of Kansas. Click here for info. (UPDATE: This show has now been postponed as well. Click here for details.)

Ruth Eckerd Hall spokeswoman Katie Pedretty said that refunds will be available for ticketholders to the Yes concert. However, if they keep those tickets and bring them to the Parsons show, they can redeem them for one free ticket, while supplies last, to a handful of other upcoming concerts, including Brit Floyd, Bret Michaels, the Allman Betts Band, the Happy Together Tour and more.

Fans can also put their refunds toward another Yes-centric show announced on Wednesday: former Yes singer Jon Anderson on July 3 at the Nancy and David Bilheimer Capitol Theatre. Those tickets will go on sale to the public soon.

In the past few days, multiple artists have canceled or postponed Tampa Bay concerts for various reasons, including health or coronavirus concerns. Among them: Itzhak Perlman, Art Garfunkel, David Foster, John Mayall and Mike Campbell’s Dirty Knobs.

Concerts by Graham Nash (March 19) and Steve Hackett (March 22) at the Bilheimer Capitol Theatre are both still on for now, according to spokesmen for both artists.

El Dorado County on Thursday joined dozens of other California counties and cities to declare a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak, ensuring resources and funding are available to slow the spread of COVID-19.

There were not any confirmed COVID-19 cases in El Dorado County on Thursday afternoon, according to a news release. All COVID-19 tests conducted in the county have been negative.

But officials there say it was appropriate to declare a public health emergency due to confirmed cases in the region and the high likelihood that El Dorado County will have a confirmed case at some point soon.

“It is a prerequisite for requesting and receiving any available federal or state funding and will allow us access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission in El Dorado County,” Dr. Nancy Williams, the county’s public health officer, said in the release.

Within hours of the state’s first reported death due to COVID-19 complications last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus. Sacramento, Placer and Yolo counties have done the same.

El Dorado County officials said Thursday’s declaration allows them to provide or receive mutual aid from other jurisdictions and helps in open up resources, mutual aid and staffing.

The county continues to work closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and California Department of Public Health on coordinated testing, investigations and guidance and help to health care providers. The joint efforts also include monitoring for acute respiratory illness and gathering information to detect new cases for lab testing and confirming infection.

El Dorado public health officials were encouraging local facilities, such as long-term care and nursing facilities that have elderly and frail residents, to create procedures that include limiting and screening visitors, and daily monitoring. They also have been encouraged to consulting with public health officials.

Following guidance from state officials, El Dorado’s Public Health agency was not recommending that local school districts close campuses Thursday, except for postponing or canceling non-essential large gatherings. Officials said the county also was considering limiting non-essential meetings and gatherings, but any specific details will be announced as they are developed.

Williams said the risk of transmission for COVID-19 remains low for the public. But she also said it’s important for people to notify their healthcare provider to determine whether testing is needed if they have respiratory symptoms and have traveled to a country with active COVID-19 within the last 14 days or if they have been in close contact with a person to have lab-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

Ellinwood,KS,,https://www.gbtribune.com/news/community-covid-19/ellinwood-city-council-approves-covid-19-measures/,Ellinwood City Council approves COVID-19 measures,"ELLINWOOD — As its neighboring communities proceed with pandemic related lock-downs, Ellinwood City Council members made the decision to keep its parks and playground open, at least until there is a confirmed case of COVID-19 in Barton County.

The Council also approved an ordinance allowing the city to pay bills during any month the city council is unable to meet due to the pandemic shut-down until Dec. 31, 2020. This action was presented as a pro-active measure as currently appropriations, or bills in lay mans’ terms, can’t be paid until the council approves them, which requires them to meet in an open meeting.

City Manager Chris Komarek addressed how the council will meet moving forward. For now, the city will continue to meet in person, and Komarek has been in communication with USD 355 Ellinwood Superintendent Ben Jacobs concerning use of the Ellinwood School and Community Library for a meeting space. This will allow for the social distancing prescribed by Governor Laura Kelly’s executive order concerning group gatherings. Information will be made public in the city’s official newspaper, its website, and posted on the door of the city offices.

“We will probably wait a few minutes past 7 p.m. to give people who went to the wrong location to get there in time for the meeting,” Komarek said.

Currently, the city is observing a “Watch situation,” and the council determined it will not move into a “Warning situation” until there is a case of the novel coronavirus confirmed in the county. Some council members argued to delay escalation until the city is notified of a confirmed case in the city. Council member Jacque Isern, however, pointed out there are a number of residents who work in neighboring cities, so the council agreed on the county option.

Komarek presented a number of considerations the Kansas League of Municipalities suggested for cities determining how to respond to the crisis. Discussion centered around how to address public access to city spaces, travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and how staff will be paid for pandemic related absences during a Watch as well as a Warning situation.

Under the current Watch, the City of Ellinwood lobby and offices are closed to the public, except for the council chamber during an open meeting. The drive-thru window is available for utility payments, and staff can be reached by phone or electronically. Other city departments are not locked down, and will remain open. Council members agreed because the number of workers in each department fall under the prescribed limit of 10 people in a space, as well as staff using common sense to observe social distancing, this was entirely appropriate.

Komarek attended meetings at the county level and at the City of Great Bend last week, and has been in contact with Hoisington City Manager Jonathan Mitchell. He noted that while those communities have amenities like recreation and activity centers and multiple outdoor spaces to consider, the same is not the case for Ellinwood. He shared actions taken to close access to parks and playgrounds in those communities. Council members came to the conclusion that there would be no benefit to the community at this time to close the playground at Ellinwood City Park, or access to Wolf Pond. They will stay open during the Watch.

The Municipal court docket for March was delayed until April. It is likely, if the crises continues, that docket will be delayed until May. All new entries are being scheduled for May at this time, according to Ellinwood City Attorney Jane Isern.

Should the city move to a Warning situation, access to the playground will be cut-off, but the park will be open. The walking track at the park, however, falls under the responsibility of the school district, Komarek said.

Komarek asked if the council wanted to discuss the opening of the pool for the 2020 season. Following suit with the City of Hoisington, the council decided to delay discussion until the April 14 meeting. Concerns over the availability of lifeguards that other cities have referred to were determined not to be an issue for Ellinwood. Komarek stated the pool manager and a number of lifeguards have current registration, and some who were up for renewal received training earlier in the month before classes for lifeguard certification were cancelled due to the crisis.

“If the pool can open, we should be good to go,” he said.





Employee pay

Should employees need to take time off to care for children home from school or daycare due to the COVID-19 shut down, they will be paid through the Family First Response fund for up to 80 hours first. If the situation continues, they can utilize accumulated sick and vacation time next. The Ellinwood City Council approved allowing employees to receive up to five days or 40 hours of negative sick leave if it is required. This, Komarek explained, could occur if an employee needs to take care of a family member, and then later is quarantined for illness and recovery, for instance.

Employees are covered under the Emergency Relief Act portion of the Family Medical Leave Act, City Attorney Isern said. It allows individuals to be off for 12 weeks without losing their job. The first two weeks of leave would be unpaid, but employees can use up sick or vacation leave during his period. Then, they are eligible to receive 2/3 of their salary if the reason they are unable to come to work is because they are caring for children because daycare and school are closed during the COVID-19 shutdown. They are not eligible for the benefit if they are home recovering from the virus.

Laura Kelly imposes statewide stay-at-home order; state logs 6th death, 267 cases","This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. Please support local journalism by subscribing to your local newspaper.

TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced Saturday the signing of a temporary statewide stay-at-home directive excluding essential activities and taking effect 12:01 a.m. Monday in response to escalation of coronavirus cases in Kansas.

Kelly said the executive order to suspend activities recognized the capacity of COVID-19 infection to escalate and a key role the public could play in restraining it by limiting interaction among people. She said the caseload in Kansas could surge from the current level of at least 267 to as many as 900 within a week. Kansas also recorded its sixth death from the virus, with new fatalities in Shawnee and Johnson counties.

""Positive cases are appearing everywhere at this point,"" she said. ""I know this has been hard. I know we have tough days ahead.""

The order will remain in place until April 19 and won’t be lifted until consistent evidence of a declining infection rate is in hand, she said. It does permit exceptions that include leaving the home for reasons of personal health or safety, to secure supplies or services and for outdoor activities.

More than half the state’s population already was under a stay-at-home order issued by county health officials. The governor said she left the decision up to counties for as long as possible.

""The reality is a patchwork approach is a recipe for confusion in our statewide fight to slow the spread of coronavirus,"" Kelly said. ""Statewide uniformity will ensure we're all playing by the same rules, and it will help prevent an influx of new cases.""

Under the statewide order, Kansans must remain at home unless going to work to perform an essential function, obtaining food or medicine, seeking medical care, providing care for children, pets, family or someone who is vulnerable, or exercising outdoors while adhering to social distancing guidelines.

""You can still go outside,"" the governor said. ""You are not under house arrest.""

All individuals performing essential functions must work from home to the extent possible. No individual leaving their home is required to carry or present any letter, ID card or other paper proving they are allowed to leave home.

Twenty-two other states have adopted comparable statewide directives, Kelly said.

The Kansas Chamber responded positively to the Democratic governor’s order.

""As the number of Kansas counties issuing stay-at-home orders grew, a patchwork of what were considered ’essential’ businesses was beginning to develop. This made it challenging for companies to operate, especially those with multiple locations in our state,"" said Alan Cobb, president of the statewide business organization.

Kansas House and Senate leaders on the Legislative Coordinating Council would review the governor’s statewide order in consultation with the attorney general and emergency management officials. A measure adopted by the 2020 Legislature granted the LCC the responsibility for analyzing Kelly’s emergency orders.

""While I appreciate the governor’s very difficult task, I am concerned about a one-size-fits-all solution,"" said Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita. ""We are not like coastal states and our efforts must be specific to the needs of Kansans.""

Emotional test

Registered nurse Ashleigh Adams witnessed the dodged-a-bullet relief of people informed their coronavirus test was negative and the despair of those who had their fear confirmed.

Adams, who works for University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kan., said she initially was assigned to care for KU hospital patients awaiting test results. As the virus infiltrated deeper into Kansas’ population, her assignment shifted to a wing dedicated to people fighting COVID-19.

""When we would come in and tell them, ’Hey, we got your test back. It’s negative.’ You could just see their face — whew. Right now, we’re dealing with the positives. You’re not seeing that. They’re not getting that relief,"" she said.

The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said more than 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus had been detected in Kansas. It’s evidence the state was traveling upward on a Nike swoosh infection curve. Five people have died, including three in Wyandotte County. Cases have cropped up in more than 30 counties in Kansas.

Officials at KDHE believe the infection peak in Kansas could occur in mid-April. The first known case in Kansas was identified on March 7.

Ventilator rationing

Tessa Goupil, 49, of Topeka, has muscular dystrophy and uses a ventilator. Reliance on the breathing apparatus to care for the most critically ill coronavirus patients led KDHE to issue a protocol to assist health professionals with decisions about prioritizing life-saving treatment.

She said the state’s approach could have a significant impact on people with disabilities.

""The message is that my life is not important. My role as a mother, and as a person, is less valuable to the state because I have muscular dystrophy,"" Goupil said. ""It is so devalued that if I need help, my ventilator would be taken away from me by the very medical professionals I would be turning to for help.""

On Friday, Goupil joined with the Disability Rights Center of Kansas and Topeka Independent Living Center in filing a complaint about the ventilator protocol with the civil rights office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

The complaint alleges KDHE’s policy discriminates against people with disabilities because hospitals responding to the pandemic would be able to remove ventilators from patients with ""advanced untreatable neuromuscular disease,"" ""advanced or irreversible immunocompromise"" and some forms of cancer.

""Unless it is significantly changed, Kansas’ ventilator rationing policy will relegate members of the Kansas disability community to die,"" said Rocky Nichols, executive director of the Disability Rights Center.

During Saturday’s news conference, Kelly said she questions whether disabled Kansans are losing access to ventilators.

""I think that might be a proactive act on behalf of the disability rights community,"" Kelly said. ""I have not heard of any of that happening.""

In harm’s way

Lee Norman, who deployed to the Middle East in 2018 as a National Guard officer, sees nurses and doctors serving in harm’s way on the front line in the war against a blitzing pathogen.

The KDHE secretary also spent 42 years in hospitals before joining the Kelly administration, and this isn’t the first time an infectious disease has threatened populations. Norman recalled ""going through this"" with the Ebola virus in 2014 and H1N1 in 2009.

""You know, when we had Ebola patients we thought came in, we had no shortage of volunteers,"" Norman said, ""but it was because they were armed with knowledge and equipment to do the work.""

Health care workers, Norman said, are altruistically driven. As long as there is some measure of safety for them, they will show up and do great work.

""One, we have to arm them with information — what's this about?"" Norman said. ""Second, we have to provide the necessary protective equipment. In this case, we've been strained on that. We have to prioritize.""

Norman said KDHE is deploying novel solutions for overcoming a shortage of supplies needed in the trenches with the novel coronavirus. The ideas include making gowns from surgical-grade clothing and using ultraviolet light to sterilize and reuse masks.

The agency also requested dentists and others who do routine medical work to cut back so they use less protective equipment.

""We need to ship that to the people that are front lines,"" Norman said. ""Traumas are still coming in the door and babies are still being delivered. We need to have the right equipment.""

Kelly said she was mindful of families at home with school-age children and parents out of work. The governor said her administration is doing everything it can to make a difficult situation less difficult.

For now, she said, officials are trying to ""buy the time we all need to get through this virus and get life back to normal.""

""I appreciate what Kansans are doing right now,"" Kelly said. ""We'll continue to work hard on their behalf, and I'll continue to hope this is all over soon. If we just stick together, we will get through this. We've been through hard times before.""

Door-knob factor

Physician Steve Stites said the most significant contribution that could be made by Kansans from a public health perspective would be to stay at home.

And, he said, channel fear of coronavirus into vigilant adherence to social distancing principles. That includes washing hands and staying 6 feet from people.

The virus is spread by person-to-person respiratory droplets during close contact. Symptoms include a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. However, some carriers of the virus show no symptoms.

""I call it the door-knob principle,"" said Stites, chief of staff at the KU Health System. ""If you go out, you don’t know how many people have touched that darn door knob. When you’re at home, you have control over your environment.""

He said people could effectively isolate themselves in the home.

""Coronavirus doesn’t jump across time and space,"" the doctor said. ""It doesn’t crawl across the carpeting. It has to have some form of direct contact from one person to another.""

Feeling good

It is OK to be anxious during this unprecedented time, said Greg Nawalanic, clinical psychologist at The University of Kansas Health System.

Maybe you could learn to play guitar.

Nawalanic offered some advice for coping with the stress of staying at home. We are in uncharted territory, he said, but know that if we make sacrifices now, we will get through this sooner.

""No one’s going to war,"" Nawalanic said. ""We’re asked to sit at home and couch surf.""

Except, don’t do that. It is important to get outside for some time every day, he said. You will feel better if you go for a walk.

Another idea: Take advantage of the three months of free lessons being offered by Fender, the guitar maker.

Make it a goal to get restful sleep at night.

""The best advice we can give is turn off all the screens — the phones, the iPads, the laptops, the email, the news, any of it — an hour before your intended actual bedtime,"" Nawalanic said. ""You say, 'Oh, what do I do in that last hour before bed?' You can try reading a book. That worked for years for people. You can also talk to one another. If you've got kids, spend time with them.""

Stephen Lassen, a pediatric psychologist with the KU Health System, encouraged parents to focus on maintaining routines, which provide comfort to children.

School being out takes away structure, Lassen said, so be sure to stick with morning and bedtime routines. Parents should create a new schedule to maintain.

""We're really in uncharted territory for kids and adults and parents — parents working from home, kids not going to school — and so we're on this collision course, if we're not careful, of things really becoming very stressful, very difficult at home,"" Lassen said.

Parents can expect more behavior issues from children. They should remember, Lassen said, that outbursts are usually caused by stress. He suggested parents have conversations about the source of stress: I’m frustrated I can’t go into work, and what is it like to not see your friends?

""For sure, there's going to be a learning curve here for everyone,"" Lassen said. ""Kids are actually pretty resilient. If we get those things in place, they will respond accordingly and do quite well. But there's going to be a period of transition here where everyone's getting used to the new routine.""",shelter_in_place,123.0,39.8415,-96.5199

Independence,KS,,https://www.kcur.org/post/kansas-city-missouri-and-independence-call-states-emergency-amid-growing-coronavirus-concerns,"Kansas City, Missouri, And Independence Call States Of Emergency Amid Growing Coronavirus Concerns","Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas on Thursday morning declared a 21-day state of emergency in the city to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.

“We’re not trying to be alarmist, we’re not trying to concern folks. What we’re trying to say is how can we make sure that we don’t see a significant impact before we can handle it here in Kansas City,” Lucas said.

In a statement posted to Twitter, Lucas wrote that ""all events with more than 1,000 attendees within the city are canceled or delayed until the emergency has been lifted.""

Soon after, officials with the Big 12 conference canceled the men's and women's basketball tournaments in downtown Kansas City.

In a press conference later, Lucas said he understands frustration over not being able to attend sporting events, concerts or other large gatherings.

“Trust me, we are in the business of collecting tax revenues and that sort of thing, so we don’t come to these decisions lightly. But we understand that it’s vital that we take an important leadership position on prevention,” Lucas said.

Lucas has also put a moratorium on all ""non-essential travel for City employees until the emergency has been lifted.""

As of Thursday, schools in Kansas City remain open. Churches with large congregations are encouraged to use their discretion on whether to cancel services. Private businesses with offices of 1000-plus people are not affected by the ban on large events.

Kansas City, Missouri, currently has no confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but health officials say spread to Kansas City is inevitable.

""We're working diligently across departments to prevent potential spread — and we're asking our community members and business owners to do their part in helping to prevent potential spread,"" Lucas said.

Dr. Rex Archer, director of the Kansas City Health Department says the city has tested fewer than a dozen people for the virus and none have tested presumptive positive.

Still, Archer told reporters Thursday he believes it is likely that there are already mild, undiagnosed cases in Kansas City. He’s encouraging people not to shake hands and even discourages fist-bumps and elbow taps, as bacteria can still be transferred.

“Think about just greeting people with the hand over the heart or a namaste. We need to break this cycle to keep this virus from moving around,” Archer said.

Under a state of emergency, the city has the power to enact a curfew, bar the sale of liquor or close businesses, but Lucas said he has no plans to take any of those measures at this point.

Kansas City buses and Kansas City International Airport remain open.

""Protecting all of our residents remains our top priority, which means that how we interact over the weeks and months ahead will need to change dramatically as we confront our current public health challenge,"" Lucas said. ""I appreciate our community's understanding during this ever-changing time and encourage all residents to continue exercising good judgment.""

Archer said that the precautions the city took Thursday will help prevent the spread of the virus, but they will not protect the most vulnerable people from contracting it.

Still, Lucas said people who are young and healthy do not need to avoid gathering in groups.

“This isn’t a mass quarantine or the area,” Lucas said.

Independence Mayor Eileen Weir also declared a state of emergency in her city Thursday.

“We have detailed emergency plans in place for each of our departments and with this declaration these emergency operation plans have been activated,"" Weir said. ""We will make a detailed announcement tomorrow with the changes citizens and the public will see to City services and operations.”

Late Thursday afternoon, Jackson County Executive Frank White, Jr., announced that the Kansas City state of emergency would expand to all of Jackson County. The executive order calls for no large group events of 1,000 or more people and applies to all of Jackson County except for the City of Kansas City.

""We will continue to closely monitor the situation in collaboration with local, regional and national health experts, who will help guide our response to this quickly changing situation,"" White said.

The declaration is in effect until the city council takes any further action.

Mayor Lyndell Brenton made the decision to make way for faster emergency response should COVID-19 spread throughout the community.

“We must come together as a community to work through this crisis not only for the well-being of our community members but for the viability of our health system,” Brenton said in the release. “We urge everyone in our community, regardless of age, to take all appropriate measures to prevent the spread of this virus.”

Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas has issued a state of emergency, forcing all events with more than 1,000 people to cancel and halting non-essential travel for city employees, his office announced Thursday.

Lucas made the move in conjunction with Health Department Director Rex Archer and Emergency Medical Services Medical Director Erica Carney. The emergency declaration is in effect for an initial period of 21 days.

“Protecting all of our residents remains our top priority, which means that how we interact over the weeks and months ahead will need to change dramatically as we confront our current public health challenge,” Lucas said. “I appreciate our community’s understanding during this ever-changing time and encourage all residents to continue exercising good judgment.”

In a news conference later Thursday morning, Lucas said the city doesn’t “come to these decisions lightly.”

“We think the steps that we’re taking today will buy important time for our public health, public safety infrastructure,” Lucas said.

Archer said it’s time for Kansas City residents to take “social distancing seriously.”

“In addition to washing your hands, covering your cough and avoiding handshakes, we encourage all Kansas Citians who feel ill to stay home and avoid crowds of any size,” Archer said. “People with high risk factors should not go to crowded events.”

Lucas’ declaration doesn’t apply to schools and won’t shutter bars, restaurants or other businesses. He said there is no reason to consider it a “mass quarantine” and avoid going out in public. He and Archer said vulnerable populations — such as those over age 60, those with heart and lung conditions and anyone who is immunocompromised — should take extra precautions.

The order would bar religious institutions from holding services for more than 1,000 individuals at a time, but they could proceed with normal meetings so long as the groups don’t exceed that number.

Lucas’ announcement is the latest in a series of steps local officials and organizations have taken to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, which has infected more than 1,000 people in the U.S.

Kansas health officials on Thursday announced three new cases of the coronavirus, all men in Johnson County who had traveled to a conference in Florida. That is in addition to a fourth Johnson County case, a woman who had traveled to the Northeastern United States.

The only confirmed case in Missouri is a St. Louis County woman.

But though there is not a larger outbreak, officials have been making preparations to limit the spread of the disease.

Universities in Kansas and Missouri have canceled classes, and the remainder of the Big 12 basketball tournament underway at the Sprint Center will take place without fans in the arena.

The Saline County Health Department said Tuesday morning in a statement on social media “we are aware that it is likely COVID-19 is here in Salina but as of 8 am there not any confirmed cases.”

Also, Kansas Governor Laura Kelly issued four new executive orders Tuesday morning. they include:

Tax filing deadline

Waste removal services

Driver’s licenses & vehicle registration renewals

Preventing evictions due to COVID-19-related issues during the pandemic

Highlights of the orders include:

#20-10

Kelly rescinded Executive Order #20-06 and replaced it with Executive Order #20-10, which temporarily prohibits certain foreclosures and evictions. The EO explicitly requires that a financial hardship indirectly or directly caused by COVID-19 be the reason a homeowner or renter can’t make payments. In addition, no landlords can evict a residential tenant when all defaults or violations of the rental agreement are caused by financial hardships due to COVID-19. These measures are especially important because housing disruption inhibits the ability of the state and local communities to effectively respond to COVID-19 and the public health dangers it presents.

#20-11

Kelly signed Executive Order #20-11, which prevents all Kansas waste removal providers, trash and recycling, from cancelling or suspending commercial or residential waste or recycling removal services for Kansas residences and businesses as a result of nonpayment due to significant loss of income or increase in expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring that waste and recycling services continue is essential to maintaining public health, especially when personal hygiene and staying at home are the primary methods for slowing the spread of COVID-19.

#20-12

Kelly signed Executive Order #20-12, extending deadlines for driver’s licenses and vehicle registration renewals and regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. All driver’s license renewals and vehicle registrations extended by this Executive Order must be completed within 60 days of the expiration of Executive Order #20-12. Many Kansans may be unable to renew their driver’s license or vehicle registration during this time, but delivery drivers and other critical employees must be able to continue critical operations and drive without fear of licensing or registration issues.

#20-13

Kelly signed Executive Order #20-13, extending tax filing deadlines to July 15, 2020, and waiving any interest and penalties for returns and payments made on or before July 15, 2020. In the event the State of Disaster Emergency originally proclaimed on March 12, 2020, is lifted or expires prior to July 15, 2020, the Department of Revenue shall continue to exercise appropriate discretion to make effective the waivers of penalties and interest for payments made up to July 15, 2020.

Covington Mayor Joe Meyer declared a formal state of emergency Thursday morning, officials said.

The declaration is a legal maneuver that will speed up the City's ability to take action during the pandemic, according to a release from the City.

As of Thursday the State of Kentucky has 47 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus. The novel virus has taken the lives of two Kentuckians.

""Extraordinary times call for extraordinary steps,"" Meyer said in the release. ""This is not a normal disaster situation. This declaration will enable us to act more quickly and with flexibility and authority to serious needs and concerns related to the spreading COVID-19 crisis.""

The order will allow Meyer to waive procedures and formalities otherwise required by law.

On Thursday Meyer announced his intent to sign three specific executive orders in the near future: appointing Assistant City Manager Bruce Applegate as the City's coronavirus pandemic coordinator; granting small businesses a 90-day grace period to pay tax obligations; and adjusting attendance protocols for Tuesday night City Commission meetings.

The following operations could be impacted under a state of emergency:

Public works

Entering into contracts

Incurring obligations

Volunteer workers

Equipment rental

Public funding

Employment of temporary and permanent workers

A potential curfew may be implemented to limit the spread of COVID-19, according to the release.

Applegate will serve as the point person for public agencies in regards to the pandemic.

""We need consistency for the interpretation of all these rules and information for staff, businesses, and residents,"" Meyer said. ""The City's response really does have to be a collaborative effort so we act in a way that reduces confusion.""

Specific changes and details on executive orders under the State of Emergency will be published on the City's website and social media as they are signed.

Things are still changing in Northern Kentucky as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 47 in the state Thursday afternoon.

There were no new cases in the three-county Northern Kentucky region, as of Thursday afternoon, according to Laura Brinson, the spokesperson for the Northern Kentucky Health Department.

There were 11 cases in the Cincinnati region as of Thursday.

Butler County - 8

Hamilton County - 1

Warren County - 1

Kenton County - 1

On Wednesday, the department announced the first confirmed COVID-19 case in Northern Kentucky. The 66-year-old woman with the disease, who resides in Kenton County, was hospitalized at the Fort Thomas St. Elizabeth Healthcare hospital.

N. Ky. Health Department closes

The department suspended its in-person services at the close of business Thursday, according to a news release from the department.

Services such as Women, Infants and Children (WIC), breastfeeding support and HIV Case Management will continue virtually and by phone, according to the release.

Services such as the Syringe Access Exchange Program services in Campbell, Grant and Kenton counties won't be available while the four-county health centers are closed.

“We are doing this in an effort, not that none of these services aren’t important, but we really, really want to make sure that we are harnessing all of our resources so that we can respond to what’s coming,” spokewoman Laura Brinson said. “We hope it will not last for long.”

Brinson said the department is getting 50 to 70 calls a day from the public and from businesses trying to figure out how to get through the next few weeks of closure. Unlike in Ohio, local health departments in Kentucky are not testing people for the novel coronavirus. Tests are done at health care facilities and processed by the state health laboratory.

Covington setsstate of emergency

Covington Mayor Joe Meyer could enact a curfew for the city under a state of emergency he declared Thursday, according to a press release from the city.

No curfew has been set yet, and it would need to be implemented through an executive order. A curfew would ""limit the spread of the highly contagious and respiratory disease,"" according to the release.

Any executive order signed under the state of emergency will be published on the city's website and social media as they are signed, the release said.

""Extraordinary times call for extraordinary steps,"" Meyer said in the release. ""This is not a normal disaster situation. This declaration will enable us to act more quickly and with flexibility and authority to serious needs and concerns related to the spreading COVID-19 crisis.""

Last week, the counties of Boone, Kenton and Campbell declared states of emergencies.

The order allows Meyer to waive procedures and formalities otherwise required by the law pertaining to:

Performance of public work.

Entering into contracts.

Incurring obligations.

Employment of permanent and temporary workers.

Utilization of volunteer workers.

Rental of equipment.

Appropriation of public funds.

McCaul, Peters, Engel, Guthrie, Eshoo, Hudson, Schrader, Bilirakis Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Prevent Critical Access Drug Shortages","WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Rep. Michael McCaul (TX-10), Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52), Rep. Eliot Engel (NY-16), Rep. Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18), Rep. Richard Hudson (NC-08), Rep. Kurt Schrader (OR-05), and Rep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-12) introduced the bipartisan Preventing Drug Shortages Act, which would help address the critical issue of drug shortages that affect the quality of care patients receive across the country. The introduction of the bill comes days after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first U.S. drug shortage related to factory shutdowns and shipping problems in China due to the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.

According to the FDA, in recent years drug shortages have steadily increased, and supply chains may become further stressed by the challenges associated with the new coronavirus outbreak. Most drug shortages stem from a supply chain interruption, often created by natural disasters, over-reliance on foreign pharmaceutical products, or manufacturing and distribution problems. These shortages threaten the adequate delivery of first-rate patient care, as deficiencies of drugs commonly used by hospitals to treat acute conditions, including bacterial infections and cancer treatment, can severely limit Americans’ access to lifesaving medicines.

The Preventing Drug Shortages Act would help mitigate these shortage triggers by enhancing transparency throughout the drug supply chain process and strengthening FDA interagency efforts to fend off drug shortages. The bill would also empower the FDA to enforce greater reporting standards on drug and active pharmaceutical ingredient makers to identify and correct vulnerabilities in their supply chains.

“Our country’s drug supply is heavily reliant on China, as we have seen in a recent drug shortage due to the Coronavirus outbreak. The Preventing Drug Shortages Act is a step in the right direction in addressing prevention, notification, and mitigation strategies not just in regards to China, but our entire drug supply chain,” said Rep. McCaul. “If a manufacturer has a contingency plan in place, and gives the FDA enough notice, the better the FDA can find alternatives to keep supply consistent. A patient should not be at risk because there was a failure of the supply chain.”

“Drug shortages under normal circumstances result in significant strain throughout our healthcare system—from patients to hospitals and physicians,” said Rep. Peters. “Unfortunately, the health emergency presented by COVID-19 is exacerbating these problems and we are already beginning to experience its adverse reactions on global drug supply chains. While we may never be able to predict or fully prevent the challenges posed by situations like the coronavirus outbreak, Congress should take steps to fortify drug supply chains. By strengthening efforts across the board to prevent drug deficiencies, my bill would help ensure America’s health centers have access to the proper resources they need so that patients can continue to receive reliable treatments.”

“As the number of coronavirus cases grows in New York, it’s critical that we take all proactive steps to ensure our health care providers have the medications to treat affected New Yorkers,” said Rep. Engel. “Many of our critical medications are sourced from China and India. The growing outbreaks in these countries and the first reported coronavirus-related drug shortage underscore the need to protect and secure our drug supply chain needs. I am pleased to help author this bipartisan legislation which will help mitigate these issues.”

“Whether it is an outbreak like the coronavirus, a natural disaster, or any number of possible interruptions to our drug supply chain, we need to ensure that Americans have access to lifesaving drugs at any time,” said Rep. Guthrie. “The Preventing Drug Shortages Act will increase transparency in our drug supply chain so we can better identify where our system can be improved. I want to thank Reps. Peters, Engel, Hudson, Eshoo, McCaul, Schrader, and Bilirakis for joining with me in introducing this bipartisan, commonsense legislation.”

“The coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated how susceptible our nation’s drug supply chain is to disruptions that could have devastating impacts on our public health because of our overreliance on China for generic drugs. The Coronavirus has already caused one shortage and it’s unclear if there are more to come,” Rep. Eshoo said. “This legislation takes some first steps to increase what information the federal government needs to receive from drug manufacturers about ongoing shortages and requires manufacturers to have risk management plans to mitigate the impact of drug shortages that affect the American people.”

“Too often I’ve heard from constituents and providers that access to lifesaving drugs has been interrupted because of a drug shortage. We cannot let this continue to happen, especially as new threats like coronavirus emerge,” said Rep. Hudson. “The Preventing Drug Shortages Act will bolster the data we have available to recognize these shortfalls earlier and eliminate potential shortages of lifesaving medications. I appreciate the partnership of Reps. Peters, Guthrie, Engel, Eshoo, Schrader, McCaul and Bilirakis in introducing this bipartisan legislation.”

“The drug supply chain is global and to ensure Americans have access to medicines, we must better understand where our drugs are coming from and how manufacturers will handle disruptions,” said Rep. Schrader. “This bipartisan bill will help to prevent prescription drug shortages by mitigating interruptions in the drug supply chain like we are seeing with the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Commonsense legislation like this ensures that Americans can access the medications that they need for themselves and their families.”

“Fortifying our drug chain will help ensure critical access to necessary medications, especially during emergency situations when the current system has often experienced strain,” said Rep. Bilirakis. “This common sense, necessary step is integral to protecting public safety and I urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort to expedite passage.”

The Bonita Springs City Council approved a state of emergency declaration this morning due to the COVID-19 disease.

""The City of Bonita Springs continues to monitor information provided by the (Florida Department of Health) while taking proactive steps to help prevent potential exposure to COVID-19,"" said Mayor Peter Simmons.

Adopting the order gives the city a chance to receive federal funding for any expenses related to COVID-19.

Previous coverage:

The Bonita Springs City Council on Tuesday will vote on whether to declare a state of emergency. If approved, Bonita Springs would join Collier County, Naples and other local governments in making the declaration.

A meeting scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Tuesday has a single item — “adopt a resolution declaring a local state of emergency for coronavirus.”

Adopting the order would give the city a chance to receive federal funding for any expenses related to COVID-19.

The City Council could declare other restrictions during the meeting. Officials have already suspended classes at the Bonita Springs Recreation Center, suspended rental inspections and canceled all special events permits until mid-April.

Lovers Key State Park, which sits in the city limits, is changing its hours to 8 a.m.-5 p.m.

The mayor said the response comes from the lessons they are learning from communities across the nation and the globe, which shows that aggressive measures implemented sooner rather than later help protect the community and the most vulnerable members.

“There is no need to panic. However, there is a profound need to prepare,” Mendez said. “I urge all of you to think of your family, neighbors and community. The elderly and individuals with chronic conditions such as heart disease, respiratory disorders, and diabetes are especially vulnerable. Because of this, we must act as a community to address the virus.”

Some of the changes include:

>> Restaurants and bars, effective March 18, 2020, restaurants and bars shall be limited to 50 percent of occupancy in order to comply with social distancing.

>> Restaurants and bars, delivery and takeout is strongly encouraged. Downtown City metered parking will be immediately suspended in order to support these measures. Parking areas within shopping areas are also strongly encouraged to create takeout and delivery designated parking spaces.

>> Places of worship, movie theaters and gymnasiums shall be limited to 50 percent of their occupancy and comply with social distancing.

>> Private or “community gatherings” of individuals over 50 are banned until further notice. “Community gatherings” does not include spaces where 50 or more persons may be in transit or buses, trains or airplanes; or waiting for transit, such as airports, bus stops or terminals. In addition, “community gatherings” does not include the following spaces where 50 or more persons may congregate, so as long as visitors are generally within arm’s length of one another for extended periods: i. office space, grocery stores, shopping malls, movie, hospitals and medical offices and facilities.

>> Bingo establishments are closed.

>> Child and adult day care centers, effective March 18, 2020, shall be limited to 50 occupants or 50 percent of their legal occupancy, whichever is lower.

>> All schools are closed, effective immediately.

>> All city libraries are closed, effective immediately.

>> All city of Brownsville residents are strongly encouraged to use online services and drive-through services while doing business with the city.

>> Brownsville bus service, BMetro will be implementing social distancing measures.

>> The Brownsville/South Padre Island Airport will limit access into the terminal building to ticketed passengers only.

>> City events are cancelled effectively on March 17, 2020 until further notice.

>> General public and private community events are cancelled effectively on March 17, 2020 until further notice.

Mendez said he has authorized peace officers, city health inspectors, code enforcement officers, traffic specialists and the fire marshal to enforce the order.

The mayor said critical city services such as fire and police protection, sanitation and water and wastewater services will not be disrupted.

“When you turn on your tap to fill a glass with fresh water, that water is and will remain drinkable,” he said. “When you call first responders, they will respond.”

Georgia designated

a major disaster

Gov. Brian Kemp announced Sunday that President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster for all 159 Georgia counties due to the impacts from the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in a statewide public health emergency being declared March 14.

""Georgia is grateful for this designation, as it will enable the state to continue partnering with federal agencies in a coordinated fight against this pandemic,"" Kemp said in a statement Sunday afternoon. ""The presidential declaration is a critical step in providing additional assistance to our state and local governments as they continue to respond to COVID-19.""

The declaration for federal assistance currently covers emergency protective measures, which are those actions taken to eliminate or lessen immediate threats to lives, public health or safety. This declaration also allows federal agencies to provide direct assistance to Georgia.

Kemp declared a public health emergency March 14, activating the state emergency operations plan and making available state resources to help address any threats to public health and safety due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As part of the Office of the Governor, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency works with local, state, and federal governments in partnership with the private sector and faith-based community to protect life and property against man-made and natural emergencies.

In addition, GEMA/HS employees are on 24-hour call statewide to assist local authorities when disaster strikes. The agency’s ""Ready Georgia"" campaign helps Georgians prepare for disasters. Go to www.gema.ga.gov for more information.

Social distancing

enforced at parks

The state will be enforcing social distancing at parks, lakes and other outdoors locations, Kemp and Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Mark Williams said in a joint statement Sunday afternoon.

This follows an earlier order to Georgians in all 159 counties for ""a mandatory shelter in place order for medically fragile individuals, and gatherings of more than 10 people are banned unless there is at least 6 feet between each person at all times.""

""Fortunately, many Georgians are heeding these directives and following the advice of public health officials to stay safe and healthy,"" the joint statement read. ""However, as we deal with the effects of coronavirus with school and business closures, people are eager for a change in scenery after days at home. They are traveling to nearby counties, heading outdoors for fresh air, and maximizing family time. Some are going to vacation homes, and others are hitting the lake, hiking trails, or campgrounds. We, too, enjoy exploring Georgia, but we urge people to stay mindful of social distancing, follow best practices, and avoid large crowds.""

The Department of Natural Resources will enforce the executive order limiting large gatherings with officials patrolling bodies of water and campgrounds. They are monitoring coves where people tend to congregate and, if necessary, using bullhorns to tell people to comply with the order.

Officials will approach people in violation of the order and demand compliance. Local officials are also trying to ensure compliance with local directives, which vary by city and county across the state.

""Please stay safe, enjoy your time outdoors, and follow our directives to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,"" the statement read. ""Together, we can flatten the curve and stop the spread of coronavirus.""",disaster_declaration,540.0,32.3094,-92.4522

According to the order, meant to “provide for public safety” and signed into law last Wednesday, no one may enter a developed recreation site within the state’s National Forest System lands, except for people with permits or federal, state and local officers, rescue personnel or firefighters on duty, until April 30.

The order includes campgrounds, day-use areas, and picnic areas, but not trailheads as its intent is to allow visitors continued access to lands for hiking and walking. Violators could earn a fine of up to $5,000, a prison term of up to six months or both.

Lands covered under the order include the Angeles, Cleveland, El Dorado, Humboldt-Toiyabe, Inyo, Klamath, Lassen, Los Padres, Mendocino, Modoc, Plumas, Rogue River-Siskiyou, San Bernardino, Sequoia, Shasta-Trinity, Sierra, Six Rivers, Stanislaus and Taho national forests, as well as the Butte Valley National Grassland, Giant Sequoia National Monument and Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit.

The order’s full text may be read here (PDF format) and the forest service’s coronavirus page is at https://www.fs.usda.gov/about-agency/covid19-updates.

Greensburg council will meet Friday to make the city’s coronavirus emergency declaration official.

Mayor Robert Bell declared a state of emergency last week, but council is required by law to vote to ratify the declaration.

Bell said Friday’s 10 a.m. meeting is expected to be brief. The emergency declaration is the only item on the agenda.

Declaring a state of emergency gives municipalities shortcuts to help deal with a crisis, Bell said. For example, in normal times the city would have to go through a lengthy bidding process before buying protective equipment. During an emergency, if the equipment is to be used to fight the pandemic, it can be purchased immediately.

The declaration also gives the city a chance of recouping some of the money spent fighting the pandemic from the federal government.

There were 24 confirmed cases of covid-19 in Westmoreland County as of Thursday.

Greensburg last week closed all municipal facilities, including city hall and public parks, to slow the spread of the disease.

(WKBW) — The City of Jamestown has announced they will declare a state of emergency on March 17th and they prepare for cases of coronavirus.

As of now, there are no confirmed cases in Jamestown, but Mayor Eddie Sundquist said he just wants the city prepared. He sees it inevitable that Jamestown has an official case in the near future.

During this state of emergency, Sundquist said they will be conducting spot checks to make sure that businesses are following the state order of half capacity. If they are not in compliance, legal action could take place.

Jamestown schools will also be closing until April 20th. Meals and child care will be offered during this time.

When asked if that date is set in stone, Superintendent Bret Apthorpe said that is ""probably going to be a lot longer than that.""",state_of_emergency,130.0,32.3397,-93.2065

TOP OF THE HOUR:

Connecticut and Oregon added to list of states under disaster declaration

2 Sri Lankan villages sealed off after positive coronavirus tests

Mnuchin says decision to reopen business will be health decision not economic

Fauci warns U.S. will have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths

More than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.

WASHINGTON — The U.S. government’s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have “millions of cases” of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.

As the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.

The U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.

Fauci was speaking to CNN’s “State of the Union” as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.

Fauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged “it’s a little iffy there” right now.

With Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.

The White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.

The addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.

Sri Lanka seals off two villages

COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.

The villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.

More than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.

Health before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says

WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.

Mnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.

But he says President Donald Trump’s top objective is the health of the American public.

Mnuchin tells “Fox News Sunday” and CBS’ “Face the Nation” that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.

He said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.

He said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.

Louisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed

WASHINGTON — Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state’s health care system.

Edwards said on ABC’s “This Week” that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.

He said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.

He made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.

Muscovites told to stay home

MOSCOW — The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.

A video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch’s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.

Non-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.

14-year-old boy dies in Portugal

LISBON, Portugal — The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.

Minister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.

Portugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.

Pelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn’t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The top Democrat in Congress says the government should be “taking every precaution” and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.

Speaking to CNN’s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump’s “denial” early in the crisis was “deadly.”

She says: “As the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.”

Pelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: “What did he know and when did he know it?”

Panama to allow cruise ships to use canal

PANAMA CITY — Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn’t immediately clear.

Holland America Line said via a Facebook post, “We greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew” and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.

The Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.

Holland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.

Panamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.

50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations

MANILA, Philippines — Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.

Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.

Many of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.

Curfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow “social distancing” among those who will be arrested.

Officials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country’s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It’s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases

TOKYO — Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.

The Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.

Another 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.

Japan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.

Serbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks

BELGRADE, Serbia — Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government’s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.

Angry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs’ health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.

Veterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and “aggravate basic hygienic conditions in people’s homes.”

Serbia’s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.

Serbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.

Random coronavirus checks come to Norway

OSLO, Norway — Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.

Citing officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.

NRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.

Pope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts

VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief’s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.

During his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `’the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.”

He cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal this past week for a global truce `’to focus together on the true fight of our lives” against the coronavirus.

Francis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter’s Square as is tradition.

Flights resume in China’s coronavirus epicentre

BEIJING — Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.

The first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.

Most access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.

The government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city’s train station reopen.

Airports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.

Spain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record

MADRID — Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world’s second-highest death count behind Italy.

Sunday’s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.

The number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.

Spain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.

RELATED: CORONAVIRUS BY COUNTY/CITY: Cases jump to 2,900, infant diagnosed in Santa Rosa

But the declaration did not come without controversy, with the council debating for nearly two hours to what extent they were allowed to impose restrictions on citizens to protect public health.

The state of emergency that ultimately passed does several things, including:

— Closing City Hall and encouraging all transactions to take place via the drive-thru window, and removing online payment fees to encourage online payments

— Giving law enforcement officers authority to break up groups of more than 10 people that gather in public places

— Strongly encouraging citizens to reduce movements to essential travel to provide food and care for loved ones, to obtain necessary items for the care and maintenance of the home or business, or for other necessary supplies

The declaration does not close public parks, does not impose a curfew and does not enforce a shelter-in-place order, though it does encourage citizens to restrict their movements to only necessary trips.

The local state of emergency allows the city to apply for state and federal financial aid to help recoup losses caused by the pandemic.

The vote came only a couple of hours after the Department of Health revealed that a 2-year-old Santa Rosa boy is one of four county residents to be confirmed positive for the coronavirus. In Escambia County, there were 10 confirmed cases, as of Tuesday morning.

Councilwoman Shannon Rice had several objections to the declaration, including words in the document directing citizens to ""comply"" and ""obey"" with necessary emergency orders.

Rice was also worried about a line that allowed ""all emergency authority for protection of the lives and property of the people of this city and continuity of government with a minimum of interruption,"" saying it would turn the city into a ""police state"" — something Police Chief Tony Tindell adamantly denied would happen.

""We’re not going to violate people’s rights,"" Tindell said, addressing the council. ""We’re here to serve and to protect, and that’s simply what we’re going to do.""

Tindell added that two of his officers were having to self-quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19.

City of Milton attorney Eric Meade, who attended the meeting remotely via telephone, said words like ""comply,"" ""direct"" and ""obey"" were appropriate in the extraordinary circumstances.

""I would tend to agree in every other setting, but every citizen’s liberty is dependent upon not inflicting injury or harm upon any other citizen, and in this situation that has particular force,"" Meade said. ""Because it is precisely the gathering into groups of greater than (10 or more people) that constitutes a clear and present danger under these circumstances, where we have a contagion that is making its way through the population.""

Mayor Heather Lindsay said she believed certain words were necessary in the declaration to relay the correct tone during a time of crisis.

""I can’t help but think back to when I’m with my children and they were very young, and they don’t know all that could make them unsafe, and you are very direct with your child and you may be harsh even with your child if you think your child is unsafe and your child doesn’t know that,"" Lindsay said. ""It’s not our role to treat our citizens as children, but it is an analogy to correlate that when you’re in a state of emergency, there’s a different tone than when there’s not a state of emergency.""

Rice maintained her opposition to the declaration, and was the only council member who voted to oppose it. Councilwoman Peggi Smith was not in attendance.

""This is not the time to infringe on our citizens’ rights. People have died to defend these rights,"" Rice said. ""It’s not the time to hand over our city to the city manager, the police chief and the fire chief. We should stay involved, and that’s what I feel that this is doing. This is handing this city over to non-elected officials, and that is not what our citizens want.""

The state of emergency lasts through April 30.

“Declaring a State of Emergency is a measure being taken (to) protect the health and safety of our community throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mayor Gordon Krantz. “My strongest message to residents is to stay home and only leave the house for essential items like food and medical needs. I urge everyone to continue practicing social distancing.”

The decision was made with the support of the mayor, council and the town’s crisis management team. It supports the region and province’s ongoing effort to “flatten the curve.”

Declaring a state of emergency gives the town the flexibility needed to manage the rapidly evolving situation through the implementation of public safety measures. The town is encouraging residents to continue self-isolation by not visiting friends and family; not organizing playdates for your children; or gathering in large groups in parks, sports courts or skate parks.

Teri Cunningham, a 51-year-old Milton man, died last Wednesday after being infected with novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. He had been admitted to Milton District Hospital a week earlier and was later transferred to Oakville Trafalgar Memorial Hospital in Oakville.

The father of three had not travelled outside the country and had not come into contact with anyone known to been infected with COVID-19. It was the first coronavirus-related death in Halton Region, which has had 14 confirmed cases to date.

A man in his 40s was confirmed as Milton's second case on Monday. He is currently in self-isolation.

Krantz said residents can still remain connected safely while practising social distancing.

USA TODAY

Monterey County on Friday declared a local emergency related to the COVID-19 coronavirus — though no cases have been detected in Monterey County.

The move was a precautionary measure taken to activate and coordinate resources, county officials said Friday.

A health event in Gonzales and the Sea Otter Classic at Laguna Seca have also been postponed because of the coronavirus.

""After careful consideration, and although we are not experiencing any active cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community, nor in Monterey County, we have decided to take the precautionary measure of postponing the Community Summit that was scheduled for this Saturday, March 7th at Gonzales High School to a future date,"" the city wrote in a letter.

Coronavirus is highly contagious respiratory virus that has infected more than 100,000 across the globe, including 260 in the United States. California has treated 70 people for the disease, according to the New York Times.

On Friday, Gonzales announced it would be pushing back the summit, which was planned to celebrate the city's selection for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health Prize from among 200 communities that applied.

The prize honored five communities for ""pursuing innovative ideas and bringing partners together to rally around a shared vision of advancing health, opportunity, and equity,"" according to a prior press release from Gonzales.

The event was supposed to run from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Gonzales residents would also receive free T-Mobile hotspots.

FYI: How can Monterey County schools protect kids from the coronavirus?

The Sea Otter Classic, a four-day bicycling festival that draws tens of thousands to Laguna Seca, and the Bicycle Leadership Conference have also been postponed, the Steinbeck Rotary reported Friday. Information on a new date will be posted at www.seaotterclassic.com, possibly by the middle of next week.

They're among the latest events cancelled across the United States because of COVID-19. Austin's SXSW music, film and technology festival was cancelled Friday because of the coronavirus, which is spreading across the world.

In addition, the virus has led to two cruise ships' passengers being quarantined at sea, including the the Grand Princess anchored about 100 miles from Monterey Bay.

The U.S. Coast Guard flew test kits out to the ship Thursday. Of 46 people tested, 21 tested positive, according to USA Today.

Most infected people have mild symptoms, but its fatality rate has bounced between 2% an 3.4%.

That concerns health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because it could easily spread among vulnerable populations.

At least 14 people have died across in the United States and more than 3,200 have died across the world.

Tips to protect yourself and others from coronavirus

This map shows the countries that have reported Coronavirus infections (Photo: PROVIDED/CDC)

The CDC has created a website dedicated to COVID-19.

It says the following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.*

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath

The CDC offers these tips for preventing COVID-19:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Impact: Salinas Chinese restaurant business dips slightly amid coronavirus outbreak

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, according to the CDC. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.

People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately, the CDC advises.

Morse,LA,03-13-2020 20:00,https://www.gazettenet.com/Holyoke-Mayor-Alex-Morse-declares-state-of-emergency-over-coronavirus-33322399,"Holyoke Mayor Morse declares state of emergency over COVID-19, public schools closed","HOLYOKE — Mayor Alex Morse announced Friday afternoon that he had declared a state of emergency in the city over the global COVID-19 pandemic — the same day the announcement came that the city’s public schools will close for at least two weeks.

During a press conference outside the mayor’s office at City Hall, Morse said that he officially made his declaration Thursday, and noted both the federal and state governments have also made similar declarations this week.

Stephen Zrike, the receiver-superintendent of the city’s public schools, told reporters that the school closure begins Monday and that a tentative plan is to reopen on March 30. Zrike said all school-related activities and events are canceled, but school-age students can pick up breakfast and lunch at five schools across the city every day from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. during the closure.

“Our priority right now is slowing down the spread of the coronavirus in our community as much as possible,” Morse said, noting the state of emergency allows the city to be eligible for expenses to be reimbursed.

Morse said the city’s second priority is to inform the public about the disruption of several city services. City Hall and its annex will be closed to all public walk-ins, though it will remain open for city staff; those seeking assistance at City Hall can call or email and an appointment may be made if the matter is urgent, Morse said. The city is evaluating a work from home policy for some city employees, he said, adding employees will not have to use accrued time off if they or their children are sick.

The Holyoke Senior Center, the Holyoke Public Library and Wistariahurst Museum are all closed, though the senior center will still provide lunch by either pickup or drop-off, and social services will visit seniors if necessary.

Holyoke Gas & Electric will remain open, but Morse encouraged citizens to use online transactions. The Holyoke Housing Authority is curtailing public visits to administrative offices and encouraging tenants to contact them for appointments. City parks, along with sports and other events, are canceled until further notice, Morse said, and Community Field will not be staffed as usual and bathrooms will be closed. Permits will not be issued for future events, he said.

Morse said he has requested that all city boards and commissions suspend public meetings until further notice unless necessary. City Council President Todd McGee has suspended council meetings for the next 30 days, according to Morse.

Students looking to continue picking up breakfast and lunch will be able to do so at the front doors of the Maurice A. Donahue Elementary School, Holyoke High School North, Dr. Marcella R. Kelly Elementary School, H.B. Lawrence Elementary School and Lt. Clayre P. Sullivan Elementary School each day from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m, Zrike said.

Parents looking to pick up medication from school nurses can do so Monday and, with the closure, the projected last day of school will be June 23. The schools are looking at possibilities for staff to work from home, Zrike said.

There will also be optional work for students online and eventually at food distribution locations, Zrike said. Later in the press conference Friday, Morse said officials will work over the weekend “exploring the potential of certain sites being open in the city for children of those parents that frankly just can’t afford time out of work or don’t have the privilege that some people have to work from home.”

Sean Gonsalves, the director of the city’s board of health, said many of these efforts help to “flatten the curve” of coronavirus infections, reducing the stress put on local medical facilities such as Holyoke Medical Center by delaying cases over a longer period of time. He also said canceling school minimizes potential exposure to the virus.

“We cannot allow our city resources to be overwhelmed by a sudden demand of services,” Gonsalves said.

“Waiting for the virus to take hold in Holyoke before we decide to act would not be a suitable or safe choice,” he said.

Morse said the city was looking at reallocating Community Development Block Grant funds into food shares and food pantries.

“Some folks may purport that many people who are making decisions are overreacting,” Morse said. “But if we’re overreacting, we’re doing exactly what we need to do because we need to do our part ... everything that we do locally affects people all across western Mass. and across the state.”

Also speaking at the press conference was Holyoke Community College President Christina Royal, who announced earlier Friday that the school will suspended in-person classes for one week beginning March 23 — the week after spring break.

Effective Monday, March 23, Executive Order 17 calls for businesses across the state to utilize alternative business models until April 6. The order also outlines ways businesses and citizens should work to protect vulnerable populations.

At the meeting, city council members approved a resolution to declare a local state of emergency to help prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.

It is a weeklong, renewable executive order that gives Mayor Warren Gooch the authority to extend it further, if necessary. It also included amendments to the number of cases and the addition of the Governor’s Executive Order, according to a release from the City of Oak Ridge.

“We appreciate your patience,” Mayor Warren Gooch said. “We are clearly dealing with a difficult situation in our country and locally. Today, we took up measures that we think will protect Oak Ridgers.”

City Manager Mark Watson presented a resolution regarding emergency leave for city employees, which was approved, and will allow city employees access to emergency leave in the case that they need to be off work and/or in quarantine due to coronavirus.

“It’s a strange and interesting time to deal with these issues,” Oak Ridge City Manager Mark Watson said. “We’ve made changes in operations to be prepared for future actions.”

City Council also approved Watson’s request for funding for essential employees to be able to stay at several local hotels in order to be in the city during this time. This is for city employees who have no illness but need to stay in the city for their job.

COVID-19 is also expected to have an impact on city utilities, according to the release from the city.

Electric director Jack Suggs said his department is working with Tennessee Valley Authority to get some funding to be able to stop utility disconnects for the immediate future.

This means if a citizen is unable to pay their bill during this time, their services won’t be cut off, according to city officials. However, bills for this service will continue to accrue and the city will be flexible in terms of repayment.

Suggs said utilities would be able to work with people to help them get back on their feet.

Instead of disconnection notices, a citizen who doesn’t pay their entire bill on time will receive a letter to let them know that their bills are adding up. The letter serves as a reminder that they can pay whatever they can afford now so they won’t have as much to pay at the end, according to the city.

Suggs also said services like the ‘Aid To Distressed Families of Appalachian Counties’, or ADFAC, are available for folks in need. ADFAC can be reached at (865) 483-6028 for utilities or rent assistance.

The city said fire staff and first responders are taking protective actions and standardizing responses between ambulances and the fire department. Leaders are in touch with Methodist Medical and paying close attention to the number of beds available. The City Manager and senior staff have been working hard to ensure that everyone is prepared.

Oak Ridge city officials said many have expressed concerns over testing in the area and whether there will be an order requiring people to stay home. An official ‘shelter at home’ order would need to come from the county health department, meaning the Roane County Health Department and Anderson County Health Department.

The city said it is doing everything it can to protect its citizens and while it may not be able to issue an order, leaders can make strong recommendations to urge people to stay home, especially if they are sick.

“We will continue to move forward and monitor all circumstances and situations,” Gooch said. “If we all work together, and I’m confident that we will, we will hopefully be able to reduce the number of tough days going forward.”

The next regularly scheduled meeting is Monday, April 13. Future meetings and special sessions will be conducted electronically for as long as necessary, the city said. To see the most current information about city facilities, click here.

Due to the Center for Disease Control advisory and Executive Order 17 that limits gatherings of 10 or more individuals, Monday’s meeting was held with essential personnel only and electronically, for city leaders to call in.

The board ratified the declaration at a special meeting Wednesday in response to the Alameda County Public Health Department confirming evidence of community transmission in the county. As of Saturday, Alameda County public health officials have confirmed 240 cases of the virus, including six deaths.

The district has already closed its indoor and outdoor facilities and canceled its programs, classes, special events and after-school programs in an effort to prevent spreading the coronavirus. Residents are also encouraged to practice social distancing at Livermore’s parks that remain open.

“We understand the impact and benefit of getting outside, experiencing nature and exercise as essential to the physical and mental well-being of individuals and communities,” District General Manager Mathew Fuzie and Board Chair Jan Palajac wrote Wednesday in an open letter to the community. “We are dedicated to keeping our parks and open spaces open and available as long as we are able to safely.”

In addition to keeping parks open at this time, the district will also continue providing Monday-through-Friday lunch service to seniors through its collaboration with Open Heart Kitchen. Lunches will be served “to-go” only.

Updated: Monday, March 23, 2020 @ 10:10 PM



—

UPDATE @ 10:10 p.m.: A public health emergency has been called at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in reaction to the coronavirus pandemic.

Col. Thomas Sherman, the 88th Air Base Wing commander, made the declaration Monday afternoon.

>> WPAFB reports first coronavirus case on base

The declaration does not close the base, the colonel said, but Wright-Patterson AFB now will be limited to “mission essential work functions and base services for life, health, and sustenance only.”

Col. Sherman said, “The intent of this declaration is to ensure we can collectively take care of our Airmen and their families while allowing commanders to make informed decisions on how to continue conducting their missions to best of their ability.

“These measures are critical to defeating this virus and returning to normal operations. Base leadership will continue to work together to assess the situation and respond accordingly.”

Effective immediately, the base will transition to Health Protection Condition level ""Charlie: High morbidity epidemic or contamination.""

Under level ""Charlie"":

Recommendations are provided to the installation commander about limiting access to the base, limiting travel, and modifying or potentially canceling gathering exercises, services and events;

Only military members, civilian employees and other Defense Department-affiliated personnel (contractors and retirees, for example) will be allowed on base. The exception applies for those groups if they are conducting official business or duties on base, have appointments at a medical or mission support facility or are using base services for sustenance.

All organizations will go to mission essential personnel only and conduct business via virtual meetings to limit interactions and comply with social distancing.

The Commissary and Exchange will remain open, as will limited food service operations on base.

These entry points will remain open, “to better protect our first responders during this event”: Area A: 1A (Commissary Gate); 12A (state Route 444/AFMC Gate); 26A (commercial traffic only); Area B: 19B (National Road Gate);

The directives are to be put into effect along with the usual guidelines that call for safe distance, hand washing covering cough/sneeze with a tissue and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth, cleaning surfaces.

Reeves’ coronavirus declaration clash with local orders?,"Impatient with what they consider Gov. Tate Reeves’ lack of guidance amid the COVID-19 outbreak, some Mississippi mayors recently placed protective restrictions on their towns’ residents and businesses.

Then, Reeves issued his own sweeping executive order.

But which takes precedence?

That’s the question leaders of some of the state’s largest cities and counties found themselves scrambling to answer on Wednesday.

“I would’ve preferred that the governor enacted an executive order sooner that impacted all of us the same so we weren’t creating confusion for people,” Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill told Mississippi Today, adding that the city would follow Reeves’ order.

“But now that it’s done, we’ll have the continuity and clarity that keeps us from enacting the things that are specific to us but might not match neighboring communities.”

Reeves’ legal team designed the executive order to serve as a minimum standard for the state’s cities and counties, his office said on Wednesday. But confusion subsequently abounded in town halls across the state as Reeves’ statewide order clashed with orders local governments had previously passed.

The statewide order, which Reeves signed Tuesday evening, considers most businesses in the state as “essential” and are therefore exempt. Several cities and counties had previously defined “essential businesses” more narrowly.

For example, the governor’s order limits gatherings in public or private places to no more than 10 people, but allows restaurants to keep dining rooms open as long as fewer than 10 people are inside at once. Many cities and counties had previously required restaurants to close their dining rooms completely.

Reeves’ order is not as broad as gubernatorial declarations in other states — many of which have included stay-at-home orders — and does not outline any enforcement measures that can be taken against people or businesses that violate the order.

Several mayors joined conference calls on Wednesday to compare notes and try to determine what, if anything, should be done at the local level to reach compliance with the governor’s order.

Amid the confusion at the local level, staffers for Reeves fielded several calls from mayors and local attorneys seeking clarification on Wednesday. Reeves himself participated in a conference call on Wednesday afternoon with representatives of the Mississippi Municipal League and several of the state’s mayors to discuss the ramifications of his order.

City of Tupelo

The City of Oxford called an emergency board of aldermen meeting on Wednesday to determine how their previously passed resolutions fit with the governor’s.

“We’d read the governor’s order and believed from our first reading that it would supersede the resolutions we had in place,” Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill said in the meeting. “We felt that ours would not be able to stay in place based on the language in the order. But I just got off the phone with the governor, and we’ve come to the conclusion that all our resolutions can stay in place.”

Tupelo Mayor Jason Shelton — who blasted Reeves publicly last week, highlighting “just an abdication of leadership at the highest level of the state of Mississippi” — is expected to issue an amended order on Wednesday to comply with the governor’s statewide order, the Daily Journal reported. The Tupelo City Council is meeting Wednesday evening to discuss the matter.

Vicksburg Mayor George Flaggs told Mississippi Today he has not changed his city’s policies based on the governor’s order and said he does not believe the order limits what he can do in his town to fight the virus. Local officials closed restaurant dining rooms in the city of Vicksburg last week and issued a nightly curfew from 11 p.m. until 5 a.m.

“The governor is giving us discretion on a lot of things,” Flaggs said. “I applaud what he is doing. I am going to take measures in Vicksburg to make sure our people are safe and to minimize the costs to our people.”

Aallyah Wright, Mississippi Today

Clarksdale Mayor Chuck Espy, who also implemented a citywide curfew, said he saw the governor’s executive order as on a “parallel track headed in the same direction as us.”

“The governor’s order technically does not factor into the directive that we give to the citizens of Clarksdale,” Espy told Mississippi Today. “His order is speaking toward businesses, but our directive is toward the citizens that live in Clarksdale. The governor can choose to allow his orders to proceed however he sees fit, but our orders will remain related. I view them as two separate items.”

Renae Eze, a spokeswoman for Reeves said the governor is following a “state managed, locally executed” principle.

“…Governor Reeves’ latest executive order sets a statewide standard in terms of social distancing and defining essential businesses to slow the spread and protect public health,” Eze said in a statement to Mississippi Today. “This establishes statewide parameters that local leaders on the front lines can build on to make decisions that are in the best interest of their communities.”

President Donald Trump recently authorized the Pentagon to call-up units of the National Guard, reserves and individuals from the Individual Ready Reserve, to assist with the response to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

On Friday, Trump said he signed an executive order that would give the Defense Department ""the authority to activate the ready reserve components of the armed forces.""

""This will allow us to mobilize medical disaster and emergency response personnel to help wage our battle against the virus by activating thousands of experienced service members, including retirees,"" Trump added.

While the National Guard and reserves may be familiar organizations to most people, many could ask what is the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)?

Unlike the others, the IRR is not an actual organized force structure that trains together regularly. This is because the National Guard and reserves are part of what are called the ""active reserves"" and the IRR is the inactive conterpart.

The IRR consists of a pool of former servicemembers who have recently left active military service, but still have time left to serve on their military contracts.

Typically, every servicemember signs an enlistment contract or re-enlistment contract that keeps them in active duty for two to four years.

Arizona National Guard members pack and sort food items at a food bank, March 26, 2020, in Mesa, Ariz. The Guard was at the food bank performing one of their first missions since they were activated by Gov. Doug Ducey to bolster the supply chain for food amid surging demand in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Matt York/AP

But those contracts are actually for eight years, and servicemembers are told that when they leave the military they can either finish up the balance of time they have left by moving into the National Guard, the reserves or the IRR.

Those who enter the IRR do so with the understanding that they could be called back to duty if the need arises.

Most of those who leave the military choose the IRR option, knowing that it is highly unlikely that they will be called back into military service.

At the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan it was a big shock to thousands of former servicemembers who were called back to duty because they were trained in jobs that were hard to fill or hard to train.

When enlisted servicemembers eventually pass the eight year cycle of the recruitment contract, they are no longer available for military service.

But that's not the case for commissioned military officers, they are always available to be called back to duty as part of the IRR.

It remains unclear if Trump's executive order wiill actually lead to any call-ups from individuals in the IRR.

""Decisions about which individuals may be activated are still being reviewed,"" said Jonathan Rath Hoffman, the Pentagon's chief spokesman. ""Generally, these members will be persons in headquarters units and persons with high demand medical capabilities whose call-up would not adversely affect their civilian communities.""

The president's order also authorized the Pentagon to send more National Guard and reserve units to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The Department has been committed to using all our capabilities to confront the coronavirus outbreak, and the president's action today ensures that we can bring select members of the Reserves and National Guard to the fight where needed most,"" Hoffman said.

On Saturday, U.S. Army North announced the activation of 800 soldiers from National Guard and reserve units.

A U.S. official told ABC News that their activation was a direct result of the president's action, because otherwise, the Army would not have been able to call them up to active duty.

Page County officially declared a state of emergency as of 10 a.m. on March 17. Around the same time, Shenandoah County declared a local emergency as well.

The declarations allow county officials to make decisions quickly about emergency actions that might be needed to help protect county residents and to draw on additional resources to prepare for and coordinate the county’s response to the potential spread of the virus.

Specifically, the declaration allows a county to pursue reimbursements that may be available from the federal and state governments as a result of their emergency declarations, among other response tools.

The President declared a national state of emergency on March 13, 2020, and Governor Northam declared a state of emergency for the Commonwealth of Virginia on March 12.

In the Shenandoah Valley, Augusta County and Staunton declared local states of emergency on Monday, following a href=""https://www.whsv.com/content/news/Harrisonburg-declared-state-of-emergency-regarding-COVID-19-568799721.html"" target=""_blank"">Harrisonburg's declaration over the weekend.

While there has been one positive test for COVID-19 in a Harrisonburg patient and one positive test across the mountain in Charlottesville among the UVA community, at this point, there have been no confirmed cases in Page County or anywhere else in the Shenandoah Valley.

However, local governments are making these moves to prevent further spread of the virus and ""flatten the curve"" of transmission.

""We see this as a proactive step,"" said Shenandoah County Board of Supervisors Chairman Richard ""Dick Neese. ""There is a lot of uncertainty with this virus and its potential impacts on Shenandoah County both short and long term.""

Shenandoah County is encourage people to utilize online resources, phone calls, or 24/7 drop boxes for country transactions if possible.

""Depending upon the severity of this pandemic,"" Shenandoah County Administrator Evan Vass said, ""services may be reduced or delayed. We ask for patience as we, like everyone else, adapt to a new normal.""

A lot of services on the state level have been affected by new CDC guidelines against gatherings of 10 or more people. You can find all the latest information on confirmed cases in Virginia, changes for restaurants, DMV closures, and more here.

Page County Emergency Management encourages residents to continue to follow Virginia Department of Health guidelines on prevention. Shenandoah County officials remind people to take common sense precautions and follow CDC guidelines on avoiding large gatherings and staying at home if you feel sick.

Preventing the spread of the virus

Most people don't suffer much from COVID-19, but it can cause severe illness in the elderly and people with existing health problems.

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can cause mild to more severe respiratory illness. In a small proportion of patients, COVID-19 can cause death, particularly among those who are older or who have chronic medical conditions. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Symptoms appear within 14 days of being exposed to an infectious person. COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

To lower the risk of respiratory germ spread, including COVID-19, the Virginia Department of Health encourages the following effective behaviors:

• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

• Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.

• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

• Stay home when you are sick.

• Avoid contact with sick people.

• Avoid non-essential travel.

For the latest factual information on COVID-19, you're encouraged to check both the Virginia Department of Health and the CDC.

(KTAL/KMSS) – The police chief of Springhill, Louisiana has set a curfew for anyone under the age of 17 in response to students being out of school becuase of the coronavirus, citing an increase in property crimes involving juveniles and the expectation that they’ll see more.

“With the situation of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) and with the emergency order issued by Governor Edwards earlier this week, I am temporarily revising the City Ordinance as to the times that juveniles can be out,” Police Chief Will Lynd said in a statement released Thursday.

“There is currently in place an Ordinance where juveniles (anyone who has not reached the age of 17) cannot be out after 11pm Sunday through Thursday and out after 12 on Friday and Saturday. This is Ordinance 70-11 of the Springhill Code of Ordinances and can be found online at municode.com,” Lynd explained.

The new times will be from 9 p.m. through 5 a.m. on any given day “until this Coronavirus Emergency has passed.”

Juveniles can be out with their parents or other legal guardians, who are defined by Louisiana statute as any person who has legal authority of a minor child or juvenile. Lynd says they can still travel to and from work, “but cannot be out roaming the streets of the City of Springhill all hours of the night.”

“With Governor Edwards signing this emergency bill, Louisiana Law gives the chief law enforcement officer of a municipality the authority to preserve life and property. We have in recent days seen and expect to see an increase in vandalism, thefts, and other property crimes related to juveniles being out all hours of the day or night.”

Lynd notes that you can research the law that gives the chief law enforcement officer the authority to do this under LA. R.S. 14:329.6 and the penalties are described under 14:329.7 which carries a $500 fine and/or six months in jail.

Welsh,LA,,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-52006789,Coronavirus: Emergency law approved by slimmed-down Welsh Assembly,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Welsh assembly sat for just one day this week and was dominated by the response to coronavirus

New legislation giving Welsh ministers sweeping powers to act on coronavirus are reasonable and proportionate, Wales' health minister has said.

Vaughan Gething said the law was needed ""to protect life and the nation's public health"".

The assembly gave its formal approval to the UK parliament bill on Tuesday, with only 15 AMs present.

Meanwhile the assembly's Presiding Officer Elin Jones has tested positive for coronavirus.

She confirmed the news in a statement on Twitter, saying she has mild-symptoms and was self-isolating. Deputy Presiding Officer Ann Jones chaired today's proceedings in Cardiff Bay.

AMs passed a motion giving their consent to the law without a vote. The bill is expected to be passed swiftly by parliament by Thursday.

Numbers in the assembly chamber were severely reduced after the UK announced strict new curbs to everyday life.

Ahead of the debate First Minister Mark Drakeford told the Senedd the restrictions were needed to protect the NHS.

Although there was no opposition expressed to the bill, AMs from across the political spectrum expressed unease at its scope and called for ministers to report regularly on the use of the powers.

Although it is UK legislation, the provisions for Wales mean AMs had to give their formal permission through a legislative consent motion.

The UK government has worked on the coronavirus legislation alongside the Welsh, Scottish and Northern Ireland administrations.

It provides sweeping measures, for up to two years, to help UK authorities tackle the coronavirus outbreak. It will need to be reviewed by Parliament every six months.

The new law would allow authorities to:

Take people into or keep them in quarantine, or direct a person to attend a designated place

Restrict or prohibit mass gatherings

Close premises

First Minister Mark Drakeford said last week the bill would give ministers powers not normally seen in peacetime.

Vaughan Gething said the bill aims to ensure the action needed to tackle the virus can be carried out across all four nations.

""I ask members and the public for your continuing trust and support to take these new powers,"" he told the Senedd on Tuesday afternoon.

""I ask for that support to take action to save as many lives as possible here in Wales.""

Welsh Conservative assembly leader Paul Davies backed the legislation, saying: ""These are unprecedented times and they call for unprecedented action.""

Labour AM Mick Antoniw was among those calling for checks and balance in the assembly. He said it was ""right that these powers are taken"", but called for ""regular reporting"" of the exercise of the powers by Welsh Government ministers.

Blaenau Gwent Labour AM Alun Davies said: ""There must be proper oversight and supervision.""

'Heavy heart'

Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said the party would be supporting today's motion ""with quite a heavy heart.""

She asked if ministers could make a statement to a ""mini-Senedd"" each time the powers are used, to enable AMs to raise any concerns.

Brexit Party AM Caroline Jones asked for ministers to seek permission from the assembly if they decide to extend when powers in the bill expire.

Some of the law's provisions could be extended beyond the two year-period by six months.

Ms Jones said the powers were ""open to abuse"" and therefore should be renewed regularly.

But she said ""far too many"" people were ignoring warnings: ""The only alternative is for the state to force compliance. We can't allow the actions of a few to put us all at risk.""

Mr Gething said the Welsh Government will report to the assembly on the use of the powers.

""I think in reality we will be making public statements about the use of powers every time we use them,"" he said.

The law includes measures aimed at freeing up resources in public services.

Ministers will be able to instruct schools to close, or to remain open.

Powers will allow the redeployment of teachers to address shortages, remove standard ratios of staff-to-children requirements, and allow people to return more rapidly to the workplace.

In health and social care, the bill will allow ministers to state circumstances where DBS criminal record checks can be ""disapplied"".

At a UK level, airports could be shut and more court hearings could take place by phone or video.",None,2633.0,30.2355,-92.8135

Lebanon and Mt. Juliet have already each declared a state of emergency for their respective cities.

Wilson County Mayor Randall Hutto declared the state of emergency for the county in an announcement on Wednesday.

Hutto and other city and county officials have met and determined the best action is to follow the State of Tennessee Executive Order No. 17 signed by Gov. Bill Lee to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the announcement stated.

Stay informed: Sign up for the Coronavirus Watch newsletter to get the latest updates.

The county's declaration coincides with the state's executive order that includes:

To limit social gatherings to no more than 10.

Persons should not eat or drink onsite at restaurants or bars, which should not be open except for drive-through, pickup, carry-out or delivery service for food and drink.

Persons should not visit gyms or fitness centers, which should not be open to the public.

Persons should not visit nursing homes, retirement homes, long-term care or assisted living facilities unless to provide essential assistance or to visit residents receiving end-of-life care if those visits can be done without unreasonable risk to others.

Wilson County has not mandated sheltering in place and residents can visit grocery stores, gas stations, parks and banks, among other places, provided they observe the precautions advised by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reduce the spread of COVID-19, the announcement states.

Public access to council meetings and video conferencing is being taken a step further with council’s recent motion to purchase quality dedicated equipment.

In order to comply with the Province’s new safety measures, avoiding public gatherings and distancing, the meeting is available on the municipality’s You Tube channel.

article continues below

Reeve Clayton Canart said it was important for the RM to improve video conferencing for people “so they don’t have to travel or us to them.” After a staff presentation on quotes and options, he said, 3C Tech probably fits what I was hoping we would get to.” The question arose about when the Virden tech company could supply the hardware.

CAO Garth Mitchell said, “That type of material is flying off the shelf right now.”

Councillor Barb Stambuski urged council to make a decision at that meeting. “I think we should make the motion and get it going.” A motion was passed to purchase the necessary equipment from 3C Tech.

In unfinished business, zoning bylaws have been put on hold until such time as council decides how to hold public hearings.

Wallace-Woodworth will supply water to a farm that is right across from the municipal boundary Road 72. This is a single farm hook-up.

Road bans come into effect on Friday, March 27, at 6:00 a.m.

In order for heavy vehicles to use a road during the ban, there’s one-time permit available for commercial operators that are examined on merit with each request. The RM is working out the means of online payment for this, including the use of credit cards. Contact the office for more details.

Wallace-Woodworth plans to be members of two conservation districts - newly minted watershed-based Souris River Watershed District and Assiniboine West Watershed District and council passed first reading.

A group of municipalities are served by Highway 83. They are getting organized to act as a lobby group. Council passed a motion to attend (by remote access yet to be confirmed) an upcoming meeting to be held in Pipestone.

Council considered a report on FCM Climate Adaptation. It’s a plan around water management on the Scallion, Bosshill and Gopher creeks in an attempt to find a way to minimize flooding and infrastructure damage. Undertaken by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, it has been an ongoing topic.

Reeve Clayton Canart re-stated other councillors’ remarks saying, “I don’t see us even remotely getting involved with something with that kind of numbers (cost),” adding that the conservation district can undertake some flood mitigation “for a reasonable amount.”

During committee reports, Councillor Mark Humphries brought forth a concern for businesses in Elkhorn and Kenton, with the coronavirus pandemic and isolation measures. “There’s at least four small businesses that are extremely worried. And [some] in Kenton too.”

On this topic, council hopes to include their economic development officer Tiffany Cameron at the next meeting.",None,1131.0,31.1655,-92.5097
Ellsworth,ME,03-16-2020 01:30,https://www.ellsworthamerican.com/maine-news/mills-declares-state-of-emergency-as-coronavirus-cases-rise/,Mills declares state of emergency as coronavirus cases rise - The Ellsworth American,"ELLSWORTH — On Sunday, Governor Janet Mills announced she had signed a civil emergency proclamation in response to the rise in coronavirus cases in Maine. As of Sunday, there were seven confirmed cases in Maine with another five presumed positive.

Dr. Nirav D. Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the U.S. CDC has affirmed Maine’s state laboratory, giving it the ability to declare a positive test at its lab a confirmed case. Those cases listed as presumed positive were tests done at an outside laboratory and need only for Maine’s lab to confirm them.

Shah said the 12 cases include a woman in her 50s in Androscoggin County, a woman in her 30s in Lincoln County and 10 people in Cumberland County, ranging from a boy in his teens to a man in his 80s.

“We now have evidence of community transmission occurring in Cumberland County,” Shah said, adding that the Cumberland County cases include “close household contacts” of other cases, and that at least one individual’s infection was contracted in Maine and cannot be linked to travel.

“Community transmission will continue to spread across the state of Maine,” he said.

The Cumberland County cases include a man in 80s and his spouse, who are residents of OceanView at Falmouth, a retirement community.

“Maine CDC released this more detailed identifying information about the case because it could potentially involve community spread. Maine CDC will continue to release such detail when it is appropriate,” Mills said.

The emergency proclamation “authorizes state officials to act quickly to delay and to mitigate a potential outbreak [of coronavirus] in Maine,” she said. “It also unlocks access to critical federal funds that will support our response efforts.”

That means the proclamation will allow Mills to take certain actions such as procuring supplies, mobilizing emergency management agencies and taking steps to protect the economy.

“Social distancing is still the most effective strategy to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Mills said.

To that end, she recommended that public schools end classroom instruction as soon as practical; that hospitals and health care providers postpone elective surgery and other non-urgent care; that long-term care providers prohibit visitors and access from nonessential personnel; and that certain social events be postponed until further notice. Specifically, she recommended canceling any events involving more than 50 people as well as those involving 10 or more people that include someone at higher risk, such as senior citizens.

“Things will get worse before they get better. But they will get better,” Mills said. The actions we take now, both as individuals and a state are our best chance at mitigating a deadly coronavirus coronavirus outbreak in our state.”",state_of_emergency,7973.0,44.5847,-68.4875

ROCKLAND, Maine — City officials have declared a state of emergency here, joining a number of other Maine cities that have made similar declarations amid the coronavirus outbreak.

As of Tuesday afternoon, Augusta, Bangor, Biddeford, Portland, Waterville, Winthrop and Westbrook have all imposed local state of emergency orders due to the novel virus.

Cities have imposed curfews and recommendations for how businesses and organizations should operate during the outbreak. Specific restrictions vary by city, but are intended to delay the spread of COVID-19.

In Rockland, gatherings of more than 10 people are banned, according to the emergency order, which went into effect around 2:30 p.m. Tuesday and will stay in place for five days or until it is renewed by city officials.

[Here’s what has been canceled or postponed in Maine due to coronavirus]

This ban applies to institutions such as bars and restaurants, movie theaters, museums and other establishments where people gather in groups.

The city is urging Rockland businesses to have their employees work from home, if they can do so.

Per the emergency order, the city is recommending that all restaurants and bars close to all in-person dining and make a shift to take-out dining if possible, which is already being done by a number of restaurants in the city.

City officials also are recommending that all fitness centers close. The Rockport and Rockland branches of the Penobscot Bay YMCA announced their closure on Monday.

Bangor and Portland announced state of emergencies on Monday. Both cities imposed curfews on bars, restaurants and other places where people gather beginning on Tuesday.

Delaware Gov. John Carney announced Sunday that any out-of-state traveler who enters into Delaware must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days in an effort to fight the spread of COVID-19.

Gov. Carney said the policy would take effect starting Monday, March 30, at 8 a.m.

Starting March 30 at 8 a.m., all out-of-state travelers into Delaware must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days to fight the spread of COVID-19. More info: https://t.co/TwxJR2GMW6 pic.twitter.com/swaFTQAl3M — Governor John Carney (@JohnCarneyDE) March 29, 2020

“Starting March 30 at 8 a.m., all out-of-state travelers into Delaware must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days to fight the spread of COVID-19,” the governor tweeted.

Under the modification to Delaware’s State of Emergency Declaration, anyone who enters Delaware from another state must immediately self-quarantine for 14 days.

CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE:

The 14-day period is measured from the time of entry into Delaware or for the duration of the individual’s presence in Delaware, whichever is shorter.

Gov. Carney’s order also applies to anyone who has entered Delaware in the last 14 days.

The order does not apply to travelers who are merely passing through Delaware.

Gov. Carney released the following statement Sunday:

“Now’s not the time to visit Delaware. We’re facing a serious situation here that is getting worse,” Gov. Carney said. “Delawareans need to stay at home, and anyone from another state visiting Delaware should immediately self-quarantine for two weeks. Everyone needs to take this threat seriously. Our goal is to limit a surge in COVID-19 cases that would overwhelm our hospital system. We’ll get through this – but everyone needs to pitch in.”

Ocean City leaders reinforced their COVID-19 message to the public again Sunday; don't come to Ocean City right now.

The mayor and Town Council reiterated their request and now demand to the public in a Sunday afternoon closed-session council meeting after it seems that the town was only getting partial compliance from the public.

""The problem is we still have some that are not listening to our requests,"" said Ocean City Mayor Rick Meehan. ""We've asked visitors and non-resident property owners not to travel to Ocean City at this time. Unfortunately not everybody is adhering to that.""

Meehan and the rest of the council met for an impromptu closed-session meeting Sunday afternoon to discuss the town's continued response to COVID-19. After the meeting the council came out with stronger messaging and new restrictions to gain the compliance of the community in the fight against the novel coronavirus.

The council decided to extend its closure of the beach, Boardwalk and now inlet parking lot to April 30. Originally the closure was set to expire on April 15.

Meehan also reminded non-resident property owners from states such as New Jersey, New York and Connecticut that under Gov. Larry Hogan's executive order those groups are asked to self-quarantine for 14 days.

Under the town's new plan property owners are asked not to rent out their properties through April 30, Meehan said. The request includes property owners who use Airbnb, VRBO or any other third-party rental service.

""It is their right to rent their properties when they want to through those agencies, but we're asking them not to rent those properties at this time,"" Meehan said.

That request is also being extended to hotels in town, Meehan said. The town is working with the Ocean City Hotel-Motel Restaurant Association to ask hotels to convey its COVID-19 message to anyone who calls seeking to make a reservation.

Ocean City is closely monitoring the situation, Meehan said. The town is also listening to its residents, visitors and business owners, and trying to protect them.

The goal of the town's new orders, Meehan said, is to protect residents and visitors and hopefully be able to open Ocean City for the summer season.

""We have seen some improvement to the situation that we were facing with regard to people coming into Ocean City, and I think our previous actions have reduced the numbers,"" Meehan said.

To keep that progress and not regress, Meehan said people need to listen to Ocean City's new order. Town officials are currently trying to find a way to enforce compliance for those who don't listen to Ocean City's new request.

""The message is you must comply and continue to comply to these orders,"" Meehan said.
