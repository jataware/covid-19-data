Montgomery Advertiser\n\nA circuit judge has amended his order calling for the release of some inmates in Autauga, Elmore and Chilton county jails with bonds under $5,000.\n\nPresiding Circuit Judge Ben Fuller, of Autauga County, entered the order Wednesday afternoon calling for all inmates to be released. The amendment gave sheriffs the discretion on releasing inmates based on their perceived threat to the public. The order states the inmates would be released on their own recognizance in an effort to ease overcrowding over fears of the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nFuller's actions had law enforcement and other judges in the circuit scrambling. They apparently were not consulted before the original order came down.\n\nVictims and relatives of victims were burning up the phone lines Thursday at the three district attorneys offices in the circuit.\n\n\"They were all concerned about the order and just what that meant for their cases,\" said Chief Assistant District Attorney C.J. Robinson. \"We couldn't file the necessary motions we need to file because of all the calls.\"\n\nThe office is reviewing each case. Release of inmates deemed a threat to the public or law enforcement will be protested.\n\n\"We understand the coronavirus pandemic and the potential exposure risks that are on everyone\u2019s mind, but our main concern is to protect our community,\" Robinson wrote in a lengthy post on his Facebook page. \"Make no mistake; the safety of victims will take precedence in our decision-making.\"\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court has suspended all court actions due to the fear of the spread of the coronavirus. The exception is proceedings deemed to be emergencies. Robinson said the release protests can be made through court records, and hearings may not be required on each case.\n\nAutauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger was conducting an audit of inmates Wednesday night to determine who would be covered.\n\n\"I have the discretion on releasing anyone, whether they can post bond or not,\" Sedinger said. \"If I feel there is a threat to the public, I won't release them.\"\n\nWhere is the coronavirus?: Interactive maps track COVID-19 cases across Alabama and beyond\n\nThe metro holds inmates charged with felonies and inmates arrested on misdemeanor charges by the Prattville Police Department.\n\n\"We will be reviewing all our cases that apply,\" said Police Chief Mark Thompson. \"If we feel the person is a threat to the public or a threat to officer safety, we are going to protest their release.\"\n\nBy noon Thursday, Sedinger had released seven inmates arrested by the Prattville PD on misdemeanor charges, but only after the approval of Thompson.\n\nElmore County Circuit Judge Bill Lewis Jr. entered a subsequent order following Fuller's original order. Lewis' order tells the sheriffs in all three counties not to release any inmates involved in his cases for five days until he has a chance to review their files.\n\nThe circuit is served by three judges, with Sibley Reynolds representing Chilton County.\n\nMost crimes that would get a $5,000 or under bonds are misdemeanors and some Class C and D felonies. District Attorney Randall Houston has concerns.\n\nVolunteers step up: Rescue Mission provides emergency food giveaway during coronavirus pandemic\n\n\"If you have a sex offender in jail who has not gotten an approved address to live after release, he may have a $5,000 bond,\" Houston said. \"He gets out under this blanket order..\n\n\"My concern is this is a blanket order with the decision made by a judge without consultation of us or other judges. A judge who who has no knowledge of all the cases.\"\n\nCrimes on the list that could receive a $5,000 or under bond include criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, some domestic violence cases, some DUI cases, incest, sexual abuse, enticing a child for immoral purposes, escape and some robbery charges.\n\nExperts caution that the highly infectious COVID-19 could wreak havoc in jails and prisons, where the social distancing recommendation public officials are spreading far and wide is impractical at best.\n\nNot seeing the map?

In Los Angeles, officials have begun releasing prisoners with less than 30 days to serve in their sentence, legal under state law, in a bid to reduce the jail's population.\n\nAll of our coronavirus coverage is free for you.

Pensacola News Journal\n\nTo provide our community with important public safety information, the Pensacola News Journal is making stories related to the coronavirus free to read. To support important local journalism like this, please consider becoming a digital subscriber.\n\nEscambia County Commissioners have ordered that Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key Beach close to the public for two weeks, starting at midnight Friday and lasting until April 2.\n\nAfter more than three and a half hours of discussion at a special meeting Friday, the commissioners voted unanimously to close all public areas of the county's beaches.\n\nViolating an emergency order during a declared state emergency is a misdemeanor offense.\n\nThe board also voted unanimously to have the Bob Sikes tolls go to all-electronic collections immediately, a move that was initially planned for April.\n\nAfter the vote, Gulf Islands National Seashore announced it would follow the lead of local governments and the Fort Pickens, Perdido Key, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa areas would be closed as of 5 p.m. Friday.\n\nIn addition, the county is asking the state of Florida to close its beaches on Perdido Key.\n\nEscambia County's decision to close its beaches was an abrupt departure from officials' message the day prior. On Thursday, Escambia County Commissioner Robert Bender held a press conference to say Pensacola Beach would remain open as members of the hotel industry pledged to limit their occupancy rates to 50%.\n\nBender said the county would keep the beach open but urged visitors to follow social distancing guidelines, limiting themselves to groups no larger than 10 people and maintaining at least 6 feet of separation.\n\nBut hospital executives and Dr. John Lanza, director of the Florida Department of Health in Escambia County, sent a letter to the county Thursday calling on commissioners to take more steps to stop people from gathering in large crowds, including closing beaches.\n\nA similar letter sent to Santa Rosa County Commissioners is what convinced officials there to have a change of heart and close Navarre Beach, said Santa Rosa County Commission Chairman Don Salter.\n\nAlso on Friday, Escambia County was going to consider following the city's lead to limit restaurant operations to take-out only, an order Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson issued Thursday. But that decision was taken out of the County Commission's hands when Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order limiting all restaurants in the state to carryout or delivery only.\n\nCommissioner Doug Underhill said he didn't support measures to limit restaurant services, saying they would hurt local workers and he didn't believe any relief would make it to them from the federal government.\n\n\"It's impossible for me to believe that there's this mass infusion from the federal government that is going to be coming in a timely enough fashion to actually protect these workers that I'm most concerned about,\" Underhill said. \"I don't know if you know who these people are, but they live their lives on a very thin margin. The paycheck pays the bills. The tips pay for the groceries.\"\n\nUnderhill also said there was not enough data about the coronavirus to support making the decision.\n\nBaptist Health Care President and CEO Mark Faulkner told the commission the measures were needed to limit the spread of the virus and preserve the health care system's capacity to treat patients. He said more testing can be done to get a true handle on the problem.\n\n\"We've walked into a dark room with small flashlight, and we've said, we've had one (positive test),\" Faulkner said. \"When we turn on the lights, we're going to see we have a lot more than one. We don't have the ability to turn on the lights right now.\"\n\nWhen originally opting to keep the beaches open, Bender said the county was following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.\n\nHowever, Grant Bridges, a Pensacola Beach lifeguard, said that on Casino Beach, especially around the pier, people have not been adhering to the guidelines to stay in groups of 10 or less and are ignoring lifeguards' instructions to disperse.\n\n\"We have groups of 30, 40, 50 high schoolers going there every day,\" Bridges said. \"We have Navy guys going behind, too, and wrestling and getting intoxicated. These are the facts. Really what concerns me is Casino Beach. That's where we have the most rescues. That's where we have the most people go.\"\n\nBridges added he and his two sisters, who also are lifeguards, are worried that they'll rescue someone who is infected with the coronavirus and bring it back to their family and older parents.\n\n\"I'm seriously concerned that if we keep these beaches open, continuing this crisis, people like me, lifeguards like me will put their families at risk,\" Bridges said.\n\nUltimately, after hours of discussion, the entire commission decided to shut down the county's beaches for the next two weeks. Bender said he hopes projections about how the virus will impact the health care system are wrong.\n\nBuy Photo Megan and Tim Deselms, of Gulf Breeze, sit within their \"circle moat of safety\" at Casino Beach in Pensacola on Thursday, March 19, 2020. (Photo: Gregg Pachkowski, gregg@pnj.com)\n\n\"This is a huge economic impact, but lives do matter more,\" Bender said. \"We can come back from economic impacts. So when we do get some direction or requests from our health care professionals, it becomes difficult for me to look them in the face and either tell them I can't do that, or they don't know what they're talking about.\"\n\nWith its vote Friday, Escambia County became the last county in Northwest Florida to order its beaches closed. Santa Rosa County on Friday morning ordered Navarre Beach to close, a day after officials said at a press conference that the beach would stay open.\n\nBeaches at Okaloosa and Walton counties, as well as public beaches in Destin, have also closed. Panama City Beach leaders voted Friday to close the city\u2019s nine miles of beaches starting at 7 p.m. Friday through Thursday \u2014 at which point the council will reconvene and determine if the closure should be extended.\n\nUnder the terms of the Panama City Beach emergency ordinance, police will have discretion in how to enforce the closure, such as blocking the beach access points. Failure to comply with the closure could result in a $500 fine or up to 30 days in jail\n\nBeaches to the west of Pensacola across the state line have also closed after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered their closure.\n\nJim Little can be reached at jwlittle@pnj.com and 850-208-9827.\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.pnj.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/20\/coronavirus-pensacola-beach-perdido-key-beach-close-until-april-2\/2884475001\/","category":"None","population":37983.0}

Joining the federal and state governments, the commission voted and approved the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic at a special called meeting on Tues.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Escambia County commission and other elected county officials considered the closure. \u201cFirst thing is to recognize this is unchartered territory. This is a challenge that is facing the county, the state, the country\u2014well it\u2019s the world, and in our lifetimes we have not had this type of outbreak of a virus to deal with. No one really knows exactly what the best thing to do is, but the best thing you can do is err on the side of precaution,\u201d said County Administrator Tony Sanks. Sanks explained that the closure is simply out of precaution; as of right now there are no confirmed cases in the county.\n\nThe preventative measure is to ensure the health and safety of all residents and employees. The decision did not come without thorough consideration. Consulting with every head of office in the courthouse before and during the meeting, the commission considered the benefits to closing now in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cThis virus does not pay attention to state and county lines. It is easily transmittable and it is something we really need to pay attention to,\u201d said Sanks.\n\nMeeting with other county commissioners throughout the state on Mon., Chairman Karean Reynolds shared an update from the Association of County Commissions of Alabama.\n\n\u201cWe had an Alabama Association County Commission meeting yesterday. The Gov. gave a report from our task force on this particular topic. The CDC website had 36 confirmed cases this afternoon in the state. Throughout the state of Ala. 40% of our hospital beds are being used. The CDC recommended that you do not engage in social gatherings of 20, the President took it to 10,\u201d said Reynolds.\n\nWith these facts in hand, Reynolds and the commission reached out to elected officials for guidance in the matter.\n\n\u201cI want to thank our elected officials for working on this with us. Thank you for giving of your time to help us make this difficult decision,\u201d said Reynolds.\n\nAddressing the room about the rapidly changing climate surrounding the virus, Sanks explained the great need for social distancing. \u201cToday, the surgeon general said that we have the same number of cases today as Italy did two weeks ago. If we don\u2019t take big measures now, in two weeks where will we be? I think it is important to make every effort you can to reduce contact with the public and with our employees.\u201d\n\nFollowing the recommendations by elected officials, the CDC, state and federal governments, the commission deemed it in the best interest of the citizens of Escambia County to close the courthouse and declare a state of emergency.\n\nWith this declaration the following will go into effect:\n\nEscambia County facilities shall be closed to the public through April 5, 2020. The Chairman, Vice Chairman, and County Administrator are hereby authorized to execute the necessary contracts, agreements, and other documents necessary for the continuity of government under the provisions of the Code of Alabama , \u00a731-9-10(b). The Sheriff\u2019s Office, County Jail, Emergency Management, County Commission & Administration, ECATS, Agency on Aging and Road Department & Engineering are departments providing essential services to the public or support services and shall continue to operate. All employees will continue to be paid during the time that the county facilities are closed.\n\nDuring the closure, the court system of Ala. will remain open; however, all in-person trials have been suspended until next month. Residents will still be able to contact local officials. Contact information will be posted on the door of the courthouse. The contact information is listed below for all individuals needing assistance during the closure.\n\nContact Information for the Escambia County Courthouse:\n\nIf you are unable to enter this facility here are the contacts for essential services that you may contact:\n\nIf you are represented by an attorney, please contact your attorney.

Commissioners could not vote on actions without a quorum, but action could be taken in an emergency without a vote.\n\nCommissioners approved the resolution during a regular meeting after discussing the ongoing coronavirus situation during a work session held beforehand.\n\nLocal municipalities including Gadsden, Rainbow City, Attalla and Glencoe passed resolutions declaring local emergencies on Tuesday. Hokes Bluff was expected to pass a similar resolution during a meeting later Tuesday evening. Southside\u2019s City Council is not expected to meet until next week.\n\nThe proclamations from the municipalities offered support to the county, while also acknowledging that extra steps could be taken to ensure that essential services could continue within each city during the emergency.\n\nThe declarations stem from Section 31 of the Alabama Code, which lays out emergency management organizations and the powers of local governments during an emergency.\n\nUnder the law, municipalities and local governments are able to prepare for emergencies by developing emergency management plans, providing rescue teams and other emergency management workers, establishing control centers to serve as command posts during an emergency and more.\n\nDuring an emergency, though, the municipality or county can waive some procedures pertaining to the performance of public work to react quickly in times of need. They also are authorized to close any and all public buildings under their control or impose a public safety curfew.\n\nMany municipalities have already begun closing city halls, public libraries and other facilities in response to the coronavirus in an effort to impede its spreading, and the county has postponed some court hearings while working to ensure that the courthouse could remain open to the public for matters that require coming to the courthouse.\n\nStill, commissioners and Chief Administrative Officer Shane Ellison urged the public to utilize online services for driver\u2019s license renewals, car tag renewals, mobile home renewals, recordings and property tax information, amongst other available services.\n\nThey also discussed restricting entrance to the courthouse to the ADA-compliant entrances on the south and west sides of the building, where hand sanitizer or hand washing stations will be available. The courthouse also plans to ask those who enter who show signs of illness to leave the facility.\n\nAfter declaring the state of emergency, the commission agreed to plan not to meet until its next scheduled public meeting on April 7. Should action be required before then, an emergency meeting likely would be called.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":103931.0}

This is not a time to look for loopholes.\u201d\n\nJefferson County law enforcement leaders say they are aware of Marshall\u2019s memo and plan to keep an eye on compliance.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we are advising citizens and businesses of the various Health Department notices and violations because everything is too new and fluid. We are referring them to the updated information and asking them to comply,\u2019\u2019 said Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith. \u201cRepeated violations may result in further action by the Health Department, referral of businesses for business license review to the Public Safety Committee or enforcement of the misdemeanor sections.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not our goal to over police the conditions, but we do want people to take this seriously - and I do believe many have - and voluntarily comply to keep everyone safe and reduce the transmission of the virus,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cI would encourage the community to adhere to the Health Department\u2019s restrictions and guidelines to keep children and families safe, by keeping them home as much as possible to limit exposure,\u2019\u2019 Smith said. \u201cIf you have to call the police for any reason, alert the dispatcher, if you or someone in your home has been diagnosed with Covid-19 or showing symptoms, so that we are able to respond appropriately to limit any exposure.\u201d\n\nJefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Chief David Agee said he is expecting 100 percent compliance.\n\n\u201cOur enforcement efforts haven\u2019t changed \u2013 our objective is to catch criminals,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cBut if we get a complaint, we will respond to it. We will advise them they are in violation and give them a chance to comply. I think that\u2019s the best way to handle it.\u201d\n\nIn Mountain Brook, Police Chief Ted Cook said the Chamber of Commerce is making sure all affected businesses know about the order. \u201cWe\u2019d much rather educate than have to issue violations,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cMost of our businesses do everything they can to follow the law. I wouldn\u2019t anticipate any violations.\u201d\n\nHoover Police Chief Nick Derzis said his department received complaints over the weekend about some businesses that remained open despite the restrictions. \u201cWe went by and talked to them and most didn\u2019t know they were supposed to be closed,\u2019\u2019 he said.\n\nDepartment leaders are meeting about the issue Monday. A challenge in Hoover, Derzis said, is that part of the city is in Jefferson County and part is in Shelby County, which is not under as many mandatory closures. \u201cWe\u2019ll abide by whatever the Health Department puts out there and we\u2019re hoping the businesses will adhere to whatever rules and regulations are issued.\u201d\n\nHomewood Sgt. John Carr said they, too, met today about the matter and how best to handle the situation, including issuing daily citations ranging from $25 to $500. \"We will be enforcing it,'' he said.","category":"deaths","population":659479.0}

The lab conducting testing last week at Church of the Highlands in Birmingham said they\u2019ve performed more than a thousand tests.\n\n\n\nAlabama\u2019s struggle to get the needed swabs and testing supplies also continues to limit the number of test sites across Alabama, Harris said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are 17 such testing sites connected to the State Department of Health and the Alabama Hospital Association, but there could be more if the needed supplies arrive, he said.\n\n\u201cWe hope to have 25 sites fully functional by the end of the week,\u201d Harris said.\n\nBecause testing supplies are low, Harris said the state is looking to only test those who have symptoms and are either hospitalized, have weakened immune systems or other health conditions, who are over the age of 65, are healthcare workers in a long-term health care facilities \u201cand other types of patients can be considered on a case by case basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenerally speaking, we only want those symptomatic patients that meet these high-risk criteria,\u201d Harris said.\n\nPeople who don\u2019t meet those criteria may still be able to be tested through commercial labs with a physician\u2019s referral, Harris said, \u201cbut we\u2019re trying very hard to preserve our testing capacity for those people who most need it.\u201d\n\nThe lack of confirmed cases in some counties, and low case count in others, is likely due to less access to testing in those places, Harris said.\n\nThe state is trying to overcome barriers to testing in underserved areas, especially in rural spots, but said \u201cthere\u2019s still a shortfall that exists there.\u201d","category":"school_business_closure","population":659479.0}

CLAIR COUNTY \u2014 The St. Clair County Commission declared a State of Local Emergency on Monday in response to the growing threat of the coronavirus.\n\nSt. Clair County Commission Chair Paul Manning signed the authorization as the coronavirus could impact the health, safety and economy of the people of the county.\n\nThe declaration allows the county to waive procedures and formalities typically needed. This includes:\n\nPerformance of public work and taking whatever prudent action is necessary to ensure health, safety and welfare of the community.\n\nEntering into contracts.\n\nIncurring obligations.\n\nEmployment of temporary workers.\n\nUtilization of volunteer workings.\n\nRental equipment.\n\nAcquisition and distribution, with or without compensation, of supplies, materials and facilities.\n\nAppropriation of expenditure of public funds.\n\nThis precedes Jefferson County banning gatherings of 25 or more people. In addition, nursing homes will now ban visitors, restaurants, bars and brewers will be pickup or delivery only for one week. Starting Thursday, all private schools will be closed until April 6.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, there were 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Alabama. Seventeen of those confirmed cases were in Jefferson County. There are still no deaths associated with the outbreak in the state.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Alabama Department of Public Health urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people, unless they can maintain a 6-foot distance between others, to limit spread of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe advice follows guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, State Health Officer Scott Harris said.\n\nHarris said restaurants are urged to keep a 6-foot (2-meter) distance between tables and limit admittance to 50% of capacity. Harris said people attending weddings and funerals should also try to maintain 6-foot (2-meter) distance. He said workplaces may not be able to maintain the distances but should try whenever possible.\n\nSenior citizens, and those with health problems, should be more careful, Harris said. Senior adults or those with chronic health problems should avoid gatherings, outside of close family, of 10 or more people, and should avoid travel by air, train or bus, the state health department said.\n\n\u201cI think if we all cooperate, if we all manage to do this then we will have a little bit of time where we are inconvenienced and uncomfortable but I know we will come out OK on the other side,\u201d Harris said.\n\nFor most people, coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. People with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health Organization.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":86308.0}

Asa Hutchinson to help curb the spread of the COVID 19 coronavirus in Arkansas.\n\nIn a press conference Sunday, Hutchinson announced that he was ordering all public schools across the state to suspend on-site instruction beginning either Monday, March 16, or Tuesday, March 17, and for the schools to remain closed until Monday, March 30, at which time the state will assess the situation.\n\nHutchinson said he gave the two-day option since some school districts could use Monday to distribute AMI (alternative means of instruction) packets to students. AMI is a set of lessons that students can complete at home to avoid having to make up that day at the end of the school year.\n\nSince the week of March 23-27 was already set aside for spring break, Hutchinson\u2019s decision to close schools this week will make for two consecutive weeks that students will not be congregated together at school.\n\nCleveland County Superintendent Craig Dupuy and Woodlawn Superintendent Dudley Hume both announced Sunday afternoon after the press conference that they would be suspending on-site instruction on Monday, March 16.\n\nThe governor\u2019s decision comes after announcing in a press conference last week that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) had recommended against broad closure of schools.\n\nAfter hearing feedback on that policy from parents and school personnel after that announcement, Hutchinson said Sunday he decided to change course.\n\n\u201cBut as we continue to look at the guidance from the CDC, where they do not recommend the broad closure of schools, it is also important to listen to the parents and educators who do not have a level of confidence in terms of their safety and what the situation with COVID 19 in their community,\u201d Hutchinson said.\n\nDuring a separate press conference Monday, Hutchinson said the CDC\u2019s guidelines is to close schools three to four days only if a student at that school tests positive for a disease. He said the CDC advises that those school use the three-to-four day closure to thoroughly clean and sanitize the buildings.\n\nArkansas Department of Education Secretary Johnny Key said the state will be working directly with superintendents during the closure to see that all buildings are cleaned and disinfected during the two-week period.\n\n\u201cWe think this is prudent at this time to make this call, and I appreciate the governor\u2019s leadership on this,\u201d Key said during Sunday\u2019s news conference. \u201cThis is a very tough call to make because we know that students depend on so many things for their care and education in their local schools.\u201d\n\nBoth Dupuy and Hume said they will be cleaning and sanitizing their buildings immediately.\n\nHere is an overview of what each school district is planning during the closure:\n\nCleveland County\n\nDupuy told the Cleveland County School Board during its regular monthly meeting Monday night that he was requiring all teachers to be logged in to their school email accounts from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day this week to assist students with their work or answer questions. He said they will not be required to be online next week since that will be Spring Break.\n\nAs for cleaning the buildings, Dupuy said the custodial staff started scrubbing the doors, walls, floors, etc. of each building on Monday. Once that is completed, he said they will then use a mister to sanitize the buildings and no one will be allowed inside after that until March 30.\n\nWoodlawn\n\nSince Woodlawn was previously scheduled to be off this Friday, March 20, before the school closure was ordered, Hume said Woodlawn students will need to complete AMI packets two through five this week. Woodlawn had used AMI packet one earlier this year.\n\nHume said he was meeting with the school custodial staff Monday morning to begin a thorough cleaning of the buildings on campus. Hume cut off access to the school buildings after 9 a.m. Monday. He said no one will be allowed inside the buildings until March 30, unless directed by the administration.","category":"school_business_closure","population":8593.0}

Of those, four were known to have had contact with people who previously tested positive. Six had no recent history of travel outside the United States or known contact with a confirmed case. In addition, three confirmed cases from outside Contra Costa have been treated at hospitals in the county.\n\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person, not only in Contra Costa County. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.\n\nTo slow the spread locally, officials with the county's public health department, Contra Costa Health Services, were scheduled to announce new public guidance in a briefing at 2 p.m. Tuesday. [Officials with CCHS said the briefing would be live-streamed on Contra Costa Health Services' Facebook page at 2 p.m. but it appears the video was delayed; if it becomes available we will share it here.]\n\nThe new guidelines are in addition to those released Friday by the county for people 50 and older, as well as people of all ages who suffer from serious illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease or immunosuppression. Friday, the at-risk community members were advised to avoid mass gatherings, such as parades, sporting events or concerts.\n\n\n\n\"CCHS is releasing updated health guidance to protect the community from novel coronavirus (COVID-19),\" CCHS Spokesman Karl Fischer said Tuesday. \"The updated guidance includes specific actions recommended for people at high risk of severe disease, community gatherings, businesses and employers, schools, public transit and the general public.\"\n\nDon't miss local and statewide news about coronavirus updates, developments and precautions. Sign up for Patch alerts and daily newsletters.\n\nOrganizers are encouraged to cancel or postpone events for, or attended by, older adults or others who are at higher risk for severe illness. Those considered at higher risk are people 50 or older, as current evidence indicates that the risk of severe illness from the new coronavirus increases with age; and people of any age who have underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or chronic lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\n\nIn adopting the emergency proclamation Tuesday, Board of Supervisors Chair Candace Andersen, said: \"The new coronavirus or COVID-19 presents our community with a challenge. While I urge you to be prepared, it is certainly not a time to panic. Following our health officials' guidelines will help prevent the spread of disease. The County and Contra Costa Health Services will continue to offer guidance and resources. Meanwhile, there is much each and everyone one of us can do to keep our families and communities well. It will take all of us working together.\"\n\nIn voting unanimously in favor of the county emergency proclamation, supervisors said \"everyone plays an important role.\"\n\nThe proclamation, the board said, will help the health department mobilize county resources, accelerate emergency planning, streamline staffing, coordinate agencies across the county, allow for future reimbursement by the state and federal governments, and raise awareness about how everyone can prepare in the event COVID-19 begins to spread in the community.\n\n\"The County and its health department will continue to work with multiple agencies and jurisdictions to keep residents informed during this local emergency,\" County Administrator David Twa said. \"We will continue to take appropriate steps to protect the safety and well being of our employees and the public.

As with other respiratory infections, there are steps that everyone can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nPeople Can Protect Themselves By:\n\nThe best way to prevent the spread of illness, including; seasonal flu, novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and other respiratory illness is to practice everyday illness prevention steps:\n\nWashing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing\n\nIf soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, making sure to rub your hands together until the sanitizer is dry\n\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash\n\nAvoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nAvoiding close contact with people who are sick.\n\nStaying home if you are sick, especially from work, school and public places.\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces\n\nPersonal Preparation Measures Include:\n\nGradually stock up extra supplies of important items, such as: soap, hand sanitizer, tissues, over the counter medications and prescription medications.\n\nGradually stock up on non-perishable foods.\n\nCreate a back-up plan for work, school and childcare in the event of closures.\n\nTalk to your workplace about getting ready. Plan for telework, if possible.\n\nCreate a space in your home to care for sick family members.\n\nReplace handshakes with elbow-bumps \u2013 make a game of this with your kids.\n\nWhat to Do if You Think You\u2019re Sick:\n\nPreviously, all testing was being performed at the CDC laboratory in Atlanta.\n\nDiagnostic testing for Coronavirus is becoming more available with state testing at 19 California Public Health Laboratories including in Sonoma County. Commercial labs like Quest are now offering these tests. Unfortunately, the capacity continues to be limited, so during this transition period, only the highest risk patients are recommended to receive testing. Speak with your medical provider if you have symptoms.\n\nCall Ahead if You Have Symptoms:\n\nIf you develop a fever, cough and shortness of breath, and believe you could have COVID-19, notify your healthcare provider by phone.

The county on Tuesday said it had nine confirmed cases.\n\nThe county's public health officer, Bela Matyas, M.D., M.P.H., in a YouTube video Tuesday explained his decision not to pursue a shelter-in-place order.\n\n\"Sheltering in place is not right terminology to be using for what is really social-distancing orders,\" Matyas said. He said the phrase is used for when residents are instructed not to go outside because the air is dangerous, such as during a toxic chemical spill or fire with smoke.\n\nMatyas said the Bay Area orders mirror the social-distancing directives individually from Newsom and President Trump on Monday. He noted that the list of exceptions for \"essential activities\" in the orders is \"very long, and very little is not excluded from the concept of 'don't go to work.'\"\n\n\"I think there has been a lot of significant misrepresentation of the content of those orders, and it's unfortunate because it's been accompanied by a lot more panic and concern,\" Matyas said. \"The problem is that people are over-reading the orders - they're overreacting - and it will potentially harm business if people are staying away from work that is essential, that should continue. And it's difficult for the economy to sustain that for any length of time. It will be difficult for people who lose their own income.\"\n\nMatyas said it's a misconception that the orders were necessary for workers to qualify for unemployment insurance. Rather, the governor's order was all that was needed, and Newsom also lifted the one-week waiting period for such assistance.\n\nSonoma County's shelter-in-place order took effect at midnight Wednesday but wasn't issued until Tuesday evening, after top county officials earlier in the day told the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors about such a plan.\n\nDr. Sundari Mase, the county\u2019s interim public health officer, stopped short of issuing the order during the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday.\n\nSonoma County has documented four cases of community spreading of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19. Two of those people work in health care, including one person who is an employee at the Rohnert Park Health Center, a nonprofit clinic.\n\n\u201cI think moving forward more quickly is probably best at this point. We had four cases in three days, and I fully expect more this week,\u201d Mase told the Press Democrat.\n\nThe county has released little to no other information about those four cases, withholding basic, general details under a the banner of patient privacy.\n\nOfficials in seven San Francisco Bay Area counties issued a shelter-in-place mandate Monday, affecting nearly 7 million people, including San Francisco itself.\n\nThe order says residents must stay inside and venture out only for necessities for three weeks starting Tuesday in a desperate attempt by officials to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nIt affects the counties of San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Cruz, as well as the city of Berkeley.\n\nNapa\u2019s order bars public or private gatherings of 50 or more persons \u201cexcept as necessary to perform essential government functions. \u201c Public or private gatherings of fewer than 50 persons are permitted in the county \u201conly if hosts or sponsors implement all of the COVID-19 risk mitigation measures.\u201d\n\n--Associated Press and The Press Democrat contributed to this report.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":87192.0}

To support vital reporting such as this, please consider a digital subscription.\n\nLocal schools in Merced County began preparations Monday to shut down classes for at least a month amid the growing threat of coronavirus.\n\nMeanwhile, the Merced County Board of Supervisors on Monday formally declared an emergency. As of Monday afternoon, Merced County had no confirmed coronavirus infections. Nearby Stanislaus County, however, has reported three infections.\n\nMerced County Office of Emergency Services and the Department of Public Health first declared a health emergency Friday. The Board of Supervisors held an emergency meeting Monday to officially ratify the plan.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\n\u201cThis declaration wasn\u2019t made lightly,\u201d Supervisor Scott Silveira said about the local public health emergency. \u201cThis cuts through the bureaucratic red tape.\u201d\n\nThe declaration opens the county to funding, reimbursement and resources, as well as expediting emergency response processes that are typically slowed by local provisions or regulations.\n\nCounty officials said it is not a matter of if the county gets a confirmed COVID-19 case, but when. They stressed that the situation is evolving rapidly. \u201cThese two emergency declarations are preemptive,\u201d Supervisor Lloyd Pareira said. \u201cThe emergency hasn\u2019t shown itself in Merced yet.\u201d\n\nCounty Public Health Director Rebecca Nanyonjo-Kemp said it\u2019s possible someone in Merced County could already have the virus, but without increased laboratory testing capability, the county cannot be sure.\n\n\u201cWe have been impacted, as the rest of this state has been, with our laboratory testing capabilities to get a true and accurate portrait of the spread of disease throughout this community,\u201d she said.\n\nTwenty individuals have been tested for coronavirus in Merced County. All came back negative or are still awaiting results. That number does not include commercial labs, which recently gained the ability to test for COVID-19. However, the county would be notified if any tests were positive.\n\nCounty officials continued to urge people to disseminate accurate information and curb the spread of misinformation, which can cause panic. Official information and resources can be found through the county, the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.\n\nImpact on local schools and parents\n\nOn Sunday, Merced County school district superintendents and county education officials held an emergency meeting where they decided to close classes at all 20 local school districts starting Thursday, preschool through 12th grade, with classes expected to resume Monday, April 20.\n\nSchool officials said they are using Monday through Wednesday to give school districts a chance to plan for drive-thru meal services, which will launch Thursday.\n\nSome parents aren\u2019t waiting until the schools officially close to keep their children at home. For example, unofficial numbers from the Merced Union High School District show that excused absences Monday were up to four and half times higher than normal, according to Sam Yniguez, district spokesperson.\n\nYniguez said parents who choose to keep their children at home can do so without repercussions. But if it makes more sense for parents to send their child to school before Thursday, that\u2019s OK, too.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons why we\u2019re not closing right away,\u201d Yniguez said. \u201cWe are giving parents and caregivers time to get their affairs in order before the upcoming school closure which starts Thursday.\u201d\n\nSome parents said the situation is causing added stress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a disruption to our schedules, so there is some stress too because we\u2019re not sure how long this will last,\u201d said Dalia Magana, 35, from Merced. The mother of three was picking up her 9-year-old child near Burbank Elementary in Merced on Monday.\n\nMagana said that she relies on child care, but she is able to work from home.\n\nShe said local education officials made the right decision in closing the schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safety measures and I think that it\u2019s the right thing to do even though we\u2019ll all have to sacrifice. I think we all have to do our part and be OK with disruptions, be OK with stress because it\u2019s going to keep other people safe.\u201d\n\nDavid Smythe, a junior at Merced High, also said he understood the need for closures. \u201cBut I can see how it\u2019s kind of unfair to seniors, especially this is their last year at this school and it\u2019s kind of being compromised by them closing the school down,\u201d he said.\n\nNathan Quevedo, spokesperson for Merced County Office of Education, said MCOE received messages from parents about the school closures. Some parents had questions about childcare options and what the closure will mean for parents who work full time.\n\n\u201cWe really hope to have more information and more resources available for our communities in the next 24 to 48 hours. I can say that we\u2019re developing a webpage now, mcoe.org\/covid19, that will link directly to these resources,\u201d Quevedo said.\n\nQuevedo also said there are plans to have a map on the website with information about school meal preparations, which will most likely be a grab-and-go style, in order to try and limit the social interaction between nutrition services staff and the community.\n\n\u201cWe really have to think about there\u2019s still people that will provide vital services in our schools and make sure that they\u2019re safe and that we have the correct protective gear, that we\u2019re not putting them in a dangerous situation, we\u2019re being thoughtful about all of it,\u201d he said.\n\nQuevedo echoed Yniguez sentiments, saying for parents who don\u2019t feel safe sending their children to school, attendance is optional for most districts until Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf (children) are exhibiting flu-like symptoms or if they don\u2019t feel good, or if you as a parent just don\u2019t feel safe sending your child to school, we understand,\u201d he said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":263228.0}

At the center of the dispute is a proposal to use the Fairview Developmental Center as a coronavirus quarantine site, an idea that drew swift and fierce condemnation from city, county, state and federal officials representing the area.\n\n\u201cThe county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal government\u2019s decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,\u201d Do said.\n\nHe and other officials say the transportation of patients into Orange County does not \u201cpreserve the health of our community,\u201d which has a population of more than 3 million.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe city of Costa Mesa requested a temporary restraining order from a federal judge on Friday that blocked possible plans to send the affected individuals to the center.\n\nOn Monday, U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton ordered federal and state officials to meet with local officials from the county and Costa Mesa to answer specific questions about how the Fairview center was chosen. According to Steel, the status of the restraining order will be decided on March 2.\n\n\u201cWe will do whatever we can do keep Orange County coronavirus-free,\u201d she said.\n\nThe declaration of a local emergency and a local health emergency creates a mechanism for officials to ask for mutual aid from county, state and federal partners in the event that resources are exhausted, county health officer Nichole Quick said. The declaration allows Orange County to better leverage resources for staffing and agency coordination.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt expands our ability to respond in a nimble and flexible way in the future,\u201d county health officer Nichole Quick said.\n\nQuick said Orange County will start testing patients who exhibit flu-like symptoms for coronavirus.\n\nThere has not been any outbreak of the coronavirus in the county so far, although one resident has tested positive for the illness. That individual has since fully recovered, health officials said.\n\nWednesday\u2019s decree follows San Francisco Mayor London Breed\u2019s declaration of an emergency a day earlier on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s warning that COVID-19 is likely to spread within U.S. communities.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we expect we will see coronavirus spread in this country,\u201d Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a question of if, but a question of when.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith 60 U.S. cases of coronavirus, we are facing a real-life crisis that must be managed,\u201d Orange County Supervisor Donald P. Wagner said. \u201cI support an emergency declaration, not because I necessarily believe the public is in more danger, but because the federal and state governments refuse to give us enough information to discharge our public health responsibilities. We want to be vigilant in ensuring the county is prepared and has sufficient resources to prevent and combat any possible outbreak of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nRep.

I am proud of also being a Californian, where we\u2019re not turning our backs on people, and that\u2019s not the case in every state in this country.\u201d\n\nThe governor said the state has been involved in monitoring and identifying individuals who have been repatriated to the state and other travelers returning to California independently on commercial flights.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s concerned,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been a day since December that\u2019s gone by where we haven\u2019t demonstrably been engaged, and I think that\u2019s an example of the resolve that we have to meet this moment head on. And so, rather than expressing concern, expressing anxiety, I want to demonstrate resolve to address that concern and anxiety, and I think that\u2019s happening in all levels of government, both the county level, obviously at the state level and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our folks.

Earlier this week, County Health Director Peter Beilenson announced the same restrictions, but issued them in the form of a directive, which did not have the force of law. A violation of the order can be treated as a misdemeanor crime. Yolo County issued the same order on Wednesday.\n\nBeilenson and other county leaders said the intent is not to cite or arrest anyone, but to have the ability to require bars to close and restaurants to only serve take-out of delivery food.\n\nBeilenson and Sacramento County Board Chairman Phil Serna were joined by Sheriff Scott Jones and District Attorney Ann Schubert in announcing the order, which will go into effect at the end of the day Thursday.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\n\u201cAs of March 19, 2020, at 11:59 p.m., the Sacramento County Health Officer is directing all individuals living in the county to stay at their place of residence except for essential activities,\u201d officials said in a statement. \u201cThe legal order is based on the same directives of social distancing issued this week to slow the transmission of the disease, but it provides more detail and enforcement ability.\n\n\u201cTo slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, the legal order limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential needs and is intended to protect those most vulnerable to the disease, and preserve local healthcare capacity.\u201d\n\nThe order includes all incorporated cities \u2014 Sacramento city, Elk Grove, Folsom, Rancho Cordova, Citrus Heights, Galt and Isleton \u2014 and unincorporated areas including Arden Arcade, Carmichael, Fair Oaks, Foothill Farms, North Highlands, Antelope, La Riviera, Gold River, Vineyard, Elverta, Rio Linda, Orangevale, Mather, Rancho Murieta, Walnut Grove, Wilton and the Delta areas east of the Sacramento River.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s flippant about this, that is unacceptable,\u201d said Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg. \u201cIf you\u2019re flippant about this you are putting yourself, your loved ones, and many people at risk of serious illness or death.\u201d\n\nThe order will be in effect until April 7 unless county officials announce a shortening or lengthening of the order.

He added, \u201cToday\u2019s order reasonably balances a dire need to limit the spread of COVID-19 with great respect for everyone\u2019s civil liberties, and our community\u2019s continuing reliance on essential activities.\u201d\n\nSheriff and DA on enforcement, arrests\n\nSchubert in particular stressed the urgency of the moment and the need for people to take this order \u2013 and the virus threat \u2013 seriously, but not to panic.\n\n\u201cIt is everyone\u2019s moral responsibility to act today, not tomorrow or next week,\u201d she said. \u201cTime isn\u2019t the main thing.

County officials said the third death was a person over age 70 with existing underlying health issues. All three deaths in the county have been older people with compromised health condition prior to contracting the virus, Beilenson said. County officials have declined to offer details about individual infection cases.\n\nHowever, the number of infected people in the county, state and nationally is likely considerably higher than published numbers because the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 tested cases has been so limited so far, Beilenson said.\n\nSacramento now joins most greater Bay Area counties, including, Contra Costa, Alameda, Solano, Yolo, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Clara in taking the legal step.\n\nThe unprecedented step goes beyond the restrictions Newsom laid out on Sunday. Newsom as well called for people not to congregate and for bars, restaurants, gyms and other group places to close, but couched that as a request, not an order.\n\nSan Francisco Mayor London Breed was the first on Monday to turn the request into an order in her county, simultaneously with five other bay counties.\n\nLooking for regular updates on the Coronavirus in California and across the nation?

The gravity of the moment and the desire to align with other Northern California counties precipitated today\u2019s decision to step up to a full order.\n\nCounty officials in Yolo and Bay Area counties reiterated they do not intend to arrest or cite people, unless they run into an egregious situation where residents or businesses are refusing to cease their activities.\n\nSacramento officials are expected to explain where they stand on police and sheriff involvement during a morning press conference.\n\nThe new order though does allow officials to enlist law enforcement officers to proactively educate people about the rules and tell institutions, such as bars, that they must close.\n\nResidents can still go to work, if their supervisors say they are needed at the workplace. The county is asking, though, that all non-essential workers be told to go home and work from home instead.\n\n\u201cThe intent of this Order is to ensure that the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible, while enabling essential services to continue, to slow the spread of COVID-19 to the maximum extent possible.\u201d\n\nThe order allows people to leave their house to go for walks, exercise, and do go to open businesses, including grocery stores, banks, laundromats, hardware stores, health care facilities, pharmacies, pet food stores, and a few other businesses that are essential to basic household functioning.\n\nIn public, though, the order is for people to remain six feet apart. Grocery stores have been given the OK to limit the number of people in the store at one time to assure that people in the store can remain six feet apart, including in the checkout line.\n\nClose businesses, conduct social distancing\n\nThe order states that while non-essential businesses must be closed to the public, business owners and supervisors are allowed to be on site to conduct \u201cminimum basic operations.\u201d\n\nCounty residents are allowed to have visitors in their homes, though health chief Beilenson said that should involve no more than six people, and only people who are healthy, and should include social distancing of at least six feet during those gatherings.\n\nThe order states that \u201call public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a household or living unit are prohibited, except for the limited purposes as expressly permitted. \u201c\n\nBingo halls and card rooms are on the list of events that are required to close. Essential businesses that can remain open include but are not limited to grocery stores, healthcare facilities, agricultural production and processing companies, banks, gas stations and laundromats, among others.\n\nSerna said the order represents a logical step as officials both understand the pandemic and deal with it.\n\n\u201cEach successive day for the past two weeks, local jurisdictions across Northern California have issued additional guidance and direction to limit the spread of COVID-19. Sacramento County has been no different,\u201d Serna said. \u201cWith today\u2019s announcement, we have in place a well-planned enforceable \u2018order,\u2019 and this latest step represents the conclusion of several sequential actions that have deliberately slowed virus transmission to date, and that will continue doing so well into the future.\u201d\n\nThe county issued a list of essential activities, as follows:\n\n\u25aa Engaging in activities or perform tasks essential to health and safety, or to the health and safety of their family or household members, such as, obtaining medical supplies or medication, visiting a health care professional, or obtaining supplies they need to work from home.\n\n\u25aa Obtaining necessary services or supplies for themselves and their family or household members, or to deliver those services or supplies to others, such as food and other grocery and cleaning products.\n\n\u25aa Engaging in outdoor activity, provided the individuals comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in this Section, such as walking, hiking, biking, running or equestrian activities.\n\n\u25aa Performing work to provide essential products and services at essential businesses and government entities as well other nonprofit organizations.\n\n\u25aa Caring for a family member or pet in another household.\n\n\u25aa Attending private gatherings of not more than six non-relatives in a home or place of residence.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":1462131.0}

Coronavirus is believed to have been first detected in a seafood market in Wuhan, China in December 2019. If someone is sick with coronavirus, the symptoms they may show include mild to severe respiratory illness, cough, and difficulty breathing.\n\nCurrently, there is no vaccine, however, the CDC suggests the following precautions, along with any other respiratory illness:\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nStay home when you are sick.\n\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.\n\nThe CDC also says facemasks should only be used by people who show symptoms of the virus. If you\u2019re not sick, you do not have to wear a facemask.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":3211252.0}

It\u2019s a step beyond the local health emergency previously declared that will allow the county to provide additional support to Public Health Services and other agencies seeking assistance.\n\n\"It does potentially provide additional sources of funding for expenses that have been incurred,\" said Office of Emergency Services Director Marcia Cunningham, explaining that it puts the mechanism in place to account financially for the costs the agencies experience as a result of dealing with the virus.\n\nThat in turn will allow the county to seek reimbursements through state and federal channels.\n\nCunningham declared the local emergency at 9:41 a.m. Tuesday during a special meeting of the county Board of Supervisors. The board has seven days to ratify the declaration, which they are expected to do at their regularly scheduled meeting next week.\n\nCunningham told supervisors that five of the county\u2019s seven cities Lathrop, Lodi, Manteca, Stockton and Tracy had previously declared local emergencies in their jurisdictions.\n\nThe county has implemented the Multi Agency Coordination group, also known as MAC, to bring all the cities and the county together Wednesday \"to discuss a common approach\" to the current crisis.\n\nAbove all, Cunningham said, \"We all need to remain calm.\" She also emphasized the importance of each individual taking care of themselves, washing hands, keeping areas clean and avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s special meeting, the board conducted business with no members of the public in the audience. While they weren\u2019t banned from the chamber, the public was \"strongly encouraged\" to stay away and watch the meeting live online.\n\nAbout a dozen public comments came in by email during the meeting that were read aloud by the board clerk and responded to by supervisors and county officials.\n\nComplying with what is becoming the new normal, seating behind the dais was arranged to allow supervisors, the board clerk and the county administrator to sit 6 feet apart. County Counsel Mark Myles, who usually sits behind the dais, sat alone at the staff table in front of the supervisors.\n\nIn the single vote the board took on Tuesday, they unanimously ratified interim Health Officer Dr. Maggie Park\u2019s earlier declaration of a local health emergency throughout the county.\n\nPark told supervisors what is known about the 13 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county: there have been no deaths as a result of the virus; all the patients are adults (no children have tested positive); three are travel-related; two are from household contact, also referred to as person-to-person spread; and two are community spread. She did not know the source of the other six cases.\n\nCounty Public Health has moved from a containment strategy tracking all possible exposures to the virus and quarantining people to a mitigation strategy.\n\n\"Due to the increased volume of cases, and the fact that we now know we have community spread, we have moved into the mitigation phase which is basically telling people if you have flu-like symptoms to stay home and self-isolate,\" Park said.\n\n\"Once you have community transmission, we longer actually issue those quarantine orders because we have other work to do as far as continuing surveillance and messaging and providing guidance. So it is all self-monitoring at this point,\" she said.\n\nConcern about the county\u2019s inventory of critical supplies needed to deal with the virus was addressed by Emergency Medical Services Director Dan Burch, who said that a cache of personal protective equipment (protective gowns, face shields) and respirators have been dispersed to \"community partners\" including hospitals and pre-hospital agencies including fire departments and ambulance companies.\n\n\"We were able to immediately offer that assistance to those entities so they could ramp up their own supply chain issues. We are continuing to process those requests to assist but now we have to send those requests to the state and access the state cache,\" Burch said, noting it is a slower process.\n\nLarge health care providers such as Kaiser Permanente, Dignity Health (St. Joseph\u2019s Medical Center) and American Medical Response (AMR ambulance) have their own supply chains that are still working, according to Burch\n\nThe EMS agency has also planned for and stocked up on hospital beds that can be deployed to the county\u2019s seven acute-care hospitals based upon a study of available \"surge space\" at each hospital, such as conference rooms and hallways, should the need arise.\n\nSupervisors were also told that the Office of Emergency Services has activated its Joint Information Center, bringing together public information officers and representatives from 32 agencies countywide in order to provide consistent messaging to the public.\n\nThe primary sources of information recommended were two county websites: SJReady.org and SJCPHS.org. Information and assistance is also available by calling 2-1-1 or (209) 468-3411. Residents who believe they have symptoms of COVID-19 \u2014 fever, cough or difficulty breathing \u2014 should call their health care provider first.\n\nWith the new order issued by the county health officer restricting hospital visitation, supervisors called upon San Joaquin General Hospital CEO David Culberson to discuss activities at the county-run public hospital in French Camp.\n\nCulberson explained that more telemedicine consultations are being conducting each day in an effort to limit face-to-face contacts between providers and patients.\n\n\"We are substantially ramping back visits. It was up to half as many on Monday,\" he said.\n\nAnd while there have been some staff exposures to patients with the virus he did not say how many half tested negative and the other half are still pending test results.\n\nSince last week, Culberson has met every afternoon with the hospital\u2019s infection control practitioner, medical staff leadership, ancillary support and nursing teams to analyze current patients or those who have come through that have been tested or may need to be tested.\n\nTraining has been implemented as more is learned about the virus. Every morning, Culberson said, a current inventory of supplies such as face masks and gowns is conducted in light of some shortages over the past few weeks, but what has helped is that San Joaquin County is a Northern California distribution hub for many critical medical supplies.\n\nAnd while the hospital has upgraded its ventilators, required by patients with critical symptoms, it has retained its older ventilators that can be used as demand increases.\n\n\"On Monday, we established a drive-thru clinic. It is by appointment only. We have to have a virtual visit on a telephone first with a provider before we can make an appointment. We saw 25 patients (Monday) and I\u2019m told demand is pretty high today,\" Culberson said.\n\nHe made it clear that the hospital drive-thru clinic operating between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is not for asymptomatic patients. They first must consult with a doctor before being referred for testing.\n\nPark discussed the county\u2019s current testing capacity, noting the Public Health lab is only able to process 60 tests per day. That is changing however, as more private clinical laboratories are coming on line to process the tests for the coronavirus.\n\nContact reporter Joe Goldeen at (209) 546-8278 or jgoldeen@recordnet.com.

The strain that emerged in China in late 2019, now called COVID-19, is related to others that have caused serious outbreaks in recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on Jan. 21.\n\nThe disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.\n\nTo avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\nRead more about the coronavirus outbreak here on the CDC website.\n\nRead the full order below:","category":"shelter_in_place","population":269419.0}

This includes:\n\nAmid fears about a widening presence of novel coronavirus in Sonoma County, the Board of Supervisors finalized a local public health emergency Wednesday as health officials step up efforts to locate 78 local residents who may have been exposed to the disease during a San Francisco-based cruise to Mexico.\n\nThose Sonoma County residents were among 2,600 passengers on the Grand Princess ship that returned to San Francisco Feb. 21 after a 10-day cruise. Twenty-five shared a shuttle trip from San Francisco back to Sonoma County Airport.\n\nThe move comes as the county ratchets up emergency preparations to control the spread of a virus that still is not entirely understood.\n\nThe county currently has two confirmed cases of the virus, known as COVID-19. Both patients are hospitalized in isolation, though county officials have declined to say where.\n\nBut \u201cwe now believe that there a number of other people in our community that have been exposed, and so we\u2019re trying to identify who those folks are,\u201d Sonoma County Health Officer Celeste Philip told supervisors during an emergency meeting Wednesday.\n\nPartial activation of the county emergency operations center already has begun, and the county is establishing a 211 hotline intended to help residents find answers to pressing questions, Emergency Management Director Christopher Godley told supervisors.\n\nBut the county already is at a disadvantage in its efforts to gain control of the virus, in that it is still awaiting the delivery of test kits from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and so is limited in the capacity and speed with which it can attempt to detect the virus, Philip said.\n\nShe said she hoped the county receives some test kits later this week, which would reduce lag time between a patient\u2019s expression of symptoms and confirmation of the virus. But for the moment, specimens from patients showing signs of infection have to be sent to a state lab in Richmond or a CDC lab in Atlanta for testing, she said.\n\nThat makes it critical for residents to focus on practices \u201cthat we know prevent spread of disease,\u201d such as social distancing, hand washing and telecommuting, Philip said.\n\nShe and Godley said local medical and emergency officials had been monitoring the growth of coronavirus since long before the first cases began appearing in the United States, largely through the transfer of patients from a Diamond Princess cruise that had been quarantined in Japan until late February, when American passengers were returned to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County and Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.\n\nOne of the patients from Travis Air Force Base who tested positive for the virus but never developed symptoms was transferred Feb. 24 to a hospital in Sonoma County, where the person remains asymptomatic, according to Rohish Lal, public information analyst with the Sonoma County Department of Health Services.\n\nA second patient believed to have contracted the virus on a Grand Princess cruise ship voyage from San Francisco to Mexico Feb. 11-21 fell ill later and also is hospitalized in Sonoma County, health officials said. That person is in stable condition, Lal said Wednesday.\n\nThey are among at least 53 confirmed cases in California, where the first confirmed fatality included another Grand Princess passenger from Placer County, who died at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Roseville on Wednesday, officials said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":495025.0}

Gavin Newsom, lasts through April 7. Public health officials instructed people to stay home unless they are engaging in essential activities, ranging from picking up groceries to seeking medical attention and exercising outdoors, provided they maintain a safe distance from others.\n\nIt prevents restaurants from serving customers on site, though allows them to order food for pickup, delivery or drive-thru service. Most businesses are required to suspend operations for three weeks, except for a lengthy list of essential enterprises such as hospitals and grocery stores, which are exempted from the requirement.\n\nThose who fail to comply with the rules laid out in the order could face a maximum of 90 days behind bars, a fine up to $1,000, or both for a misdemeanor under a California Health and Safety Code section that penalizes people who ignore orders from health officers.\n\nA separate state health and safety code gives local sheriff\u2019s and police departments the authority to enforce health mandates. Local agencies are hoping to forgo that route and will instead urge individuals to comply with the order voluntarily, said Petaluma Police Chief Ken Savano, who also serves as the president of the Sonoma County Law Enforcement Chiefs Association. The group of local leaders have discussed how to best unify their strategies and public messaging in response to the shelter-in-place order, Savano said.\n\n\u201cWe want to provide clear communication and expectations and make sure that the community is informed,\u201d Savano said.\n\nThe approach is being adopted by law enforcement agencies throughout the state as residents are told to stay home in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, said Ron Lawrence, president of the California Police Chiefs Association and chief of the Citrus Heights Police Department.\n\nWhile criminals may try to take advantage of shelter-in-place orders by looting stores or committing other types of crimes, law enforcement officers understand most people violating the order are likely confused and worried about the coronavirus pandemic, he said.\n\n\u201cOur objective is to educate our community as best as possible, to ask for voluntary compliance,\u201d Lawrence said.\n\n\u201cPolice chiefs want to use enforcement as an absolute last possible resort, though obviously we have the legal authority to do it.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement agencies throughout Sonoma County are referring reports of businesses ignoring the law to the county Department of Health Services, though law enforcement could step in if needed, Savano said.\n\nDark storefronts and relatively empty roads indicate Sonoma County residents are heeding the order.\n\nSavano said he has not heard of anyone who didn\u2019t comply with the county\u2019s instructions after they were given more information about the restrictions, he added.\n\nPolice officers in Santa Rosa have also seen lighter traffic and a dip in calls for help since the county issued the shelter-in-place order, Santa Rosa Police Chief Rainer Navarro said.\n\nIn a video shared on his department\u2019s social media pages Wednesday, Navarro urged residents to follow the county\u2019s order voluntarily.\n\nSonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick, whose deputies patrol the county\u2019s unincorporated land and the contract cities of Windsor and Sonoma, shared a similar video the day prior.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to do the job that we should be doing, which is handling emergency calls for service, rather than getting wrapped up in a call about a business that\u2019s open or a large group,\u201d Navarro said.\n\nBoth Savano and Navarro, whose agencies are prioritizing crucial calls for help during the shelter-in-place order, urged people to dial 211 or use online county resources to find out more information about the virus, rather than relying on dispatchers for the publicly available information. Each one of those calls can take dispatchers several minutes to resolve, Navarro said.\n\nYou can reach Staff Writer Nashelly Chavez at 707-521-5203 or nashelly.chavez@pressdemocrat.com.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":495025.0}

The Yuba County Board of Supervisors and Sutter County Board of Supervisors will consider her recommendation at their respective meetings on Tuesday, March 10, 2020.\n\nDr. Luu and staff from Yuba and Sutter counties believe this is the right time to make the declaration to ensure an appropriate, timely and organized response in the event COVID-19 cases are identified in the bi-county region. Dr. Luu believes it is simply a matter of time before someone in the region tests positive for the virus, so increasing monitoring and responsive capabilities now will further enable public health teams to prevent as much community transmission as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff from both Yuba and Sutter counties have been working closely together to monitor residents who believe they could have COVID-19, communicate plans with area hospitals and health clinics, ensure nurses and first responders have the tools necessary to keep themselves healthy and safe, and communicate important information to the public. A coronavirus preparedness group was established last month, and that group has been in communication with each facet of the community \u2013 like schools, hospitals, Beale Air Force Base, and public safety entities \u2013 to ensure the area as a whole is equipped with the best knowledge and tools to minimize the impact of COVID-19.\n\nOver the past several weeks of COVID-19 concerns, public health staff from both counties have been operating what is known as a Department Operations Center (DOC) at a low level. The DOC is now elevating to the next level and stepping up efforts to address the health threat. A bi-county Emergency Operations Center based in Yuba County has also opened. This means staff from both counties are working together around the clock to ensure that resources and staffing remain in healthy and reliable supply.\n\nA Bi-County Call Center has been established to respond to inquiries from area residents regarding the COVID-19 threat. The Call Center number is 749-7700, and will be open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The Call Center is intended to field general questions, not provide medical advice. Please call your primary care physician for medical advice.\n\nYuba and Sutter counties have been planning for this possibility and staff are properly prepared to handle the work to come. Since there are NO confirmed cases in either county, the approach may look different from Sacramento, Placer, and other counties, where community transmission has been confirmed. Nonetheless, increasing the level of public health response is necessary in focusing vital resources on preventing severe illnesses and deaths.\n\nWith no confirmed cases at this time, and per California Department of Public Health guidelines, en masse cancellation of schools is not recommended. Schools will continue with measures to prevent spread of COVID-19. The Counties continue to work closely with the Offices of Education in both counties and their respective school districts to plan and prepare our schools for COVID-19 (those CDPH guidelines can be read here).\n\nDr. Luu continues to recommend hand-washing and practicing good hygiene. Vulnerable populations \u2013 the elderly and those with chronic illnesses \u2013 are encouraged to stay home as much as possible and avoid large gatherings. Keeping yourself from getting sick in the first place remains key in this effort.\n\nIf you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as fever, chills, or cough and have recently traveled to a country with widespread community transmission (Iran, Italy, China, South Korea), or been in close contact with a patient who has had COVID-19, immediately contact your medical provider by phone \u2013 do not go into Urgent Care, the Emergency Room or the doctor\u2019s office. Instead, you should call your personal physician, who can assess whether your illness matches those of COVID-19 and if testing should be completed.

This includes:\n\nSutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital issued quarantine orders this week to at least 30 of its hospital workers who had contact with a patient with the coronavirus, the largest isolation order publicly reported so far at a single health care facility treating patients with the infectious disease in California, the union representing most front-line hospital staff said Thursday.\n\nThe union revealed the quarantine the same day Sonoma County public health officials announced a second confirmed case of COVID-19 from a local resident seeking care at an undisclosed Santa Rosa hospital. Both people traveled on a February round-trip cruise on the Grand Princess ship from San Francisco to Mexico and returned home on a shuttle from the port to Sonoma County, public health officials said.\n\nSutter officials would not say if the patient who exposed the hospital workers to the coronavirus was either of two cruise ship passengers who are local residents being treated in isolation at a Santa Rosa hospital, or a third passenger from another ship, the Diamond Princess, transferred in February to a local hospital from Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.\n\nThe union issued a statement urging hospitals to protect their workers.\n\n\u201cThe workers aren\u2019t being tested before being sent home,\u201d said Sean Wherley, spokesman with SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. \u201cThey\u2019re sent home but they are potentially exposing their families. It\u2019s not clear how this is limiting the spread.\u201d\n\nSutter executives would not confirm Thursday that employees had been sent home and declined to answer a reporter\u2019s questions, instead issuing a prepared statement through a spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our patients and employees\u201d is top priority, the spokeswoman said. The hospital continues to update our protocols regarding the coronavirus \u201cin accordance with best practices established by federal, state and local authorities.\u201d\n\nThe employees under isolation in the state come from a wide range of positions within the hospitals, \u201canyone from the housekeeper coming into the room without being advised, the phlebotomist drawing the blood, the admitting clerk who was a first point of contact,\u201d Wherley said.\n\nThe union pressed hospitals to develop better communication lines between executives and staff, establish early assessment protocols and ensure facilities have sufficient protective equipment and enough staff on duty.\n\nStatewide, the union estimated at least 50 caregivers had been sent home from jobs at hospitals after they treated or came into contact with patients infected with COVID-19. At least 10 health care workers were taken off the job Feb. 27 at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View and Los Gatos.\n\nAnother 10 workers were isolated Wednesday from Kaiser Permanente in Roseville, where a man who died from the disease had been under care for six days.\n\nTwo workers from Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles were quarantined Tuesday.\n\nWherley, whose union represents 365 workers at Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital, said he had no details about the circumstances of the quarantine in Santa Rosa.\n\n\u201cHospital executives need to collaborate with employees to understand the circumstances: are there supplies in place?

It includes an order to cancel, postpone or modify large gatherings as per state guidelines. The Tuolumne County Supervisors are expected to ratify the action at a meeting next week. Pertinent information is as follows:\n\nThe Public Health Department has activated its Department Operations Center (DOC) to effectively respond to the COVID-19 incident, including communication and coordination with the County\u2019s federal, state, and local partners.\n\nWhile there are not yet any confirmed cases within the county, the Acting Tuolumne County Health Officer has declared a local health emergency in order to enhance the effectiveness of the response to COVID-19, to seek and utilize mutual aid, potentially obtain reimbursement, and ensure that the County\u2019s public health professionals and providers have all necessary resources to provide quality care and keep our community safe. Along with this declaration, Dr. Sergienko has issued an order to support the guidance on mass gatherings released by the State this week.\n\nTesting\n\nTesting is being conducted at the discretion of health care providers in the community, based on their clinical assessment and currently recommended guidance. Tests that will be conducted through the Public Health laboratory system are coordinated with the County Public Health Department. Testing is available through Quest laboratories with a health care provider\u2019s order. These tests are not required to be communicated through the Public Health Department, but local providers are strongly encouraged to do so. Any positive test result must be reported to the Public Health Department\n\nMass Gatherings\n\nGuidance from the State was issued on March 11th regarding mass gatherings in an effort to slow the rate of transmission of COVID-19 in California. You can review the guidance details here. Dr. Sergienko has issued an order to support and implement these state recommendations in Tuolumne County.\n\nSchools\n\nAt this time it is not being recommended to close schools as Tuolumne county does not currently have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no evidence of community spread. It is of more benefit to allow students to continue to attend school with the implementation of the recommended increase in hygiene and monitoring practices, as well as suggested limitation of some activities. Recommended actions for schools can be found here. Please do not send your children to school if they are ill and\/or have a fever without taking medication.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nThe CDC has updated information and guidance for specific audiences such as businesses, healthcare professionals, schools, community- and faith-based organizations, vulnerable populations, and more here. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) also has specific guidance documents available here.\n\nPractice everyday preventions to stay healthy. Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, or with hand sanitizer when soap is not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. If you are ill, stay at home. If other family members are ill, including children, keep them home.\n\nPractice social distancing: put more space between yourself and others. About six feet is good, if possible. Avoid contact with people who are sick.\n\nClean frequently touched surfaces and objects often with soap and water or household cleaners. Don\u2019t forget your cell phone.\n\nIf you have symptoms or get sick\u2026\n\nStay home, unless you need to seek medical care. Call ahead before visiting your doctor, clinic, or hospital. Wear a face mask to avoid spreading germs.\n\nCover your cough with a tissue and immediately throw it in the trash, or cough into your bent elbow. Wash your hands after using a tissue. Wash your hands often and avoid sharing personal items.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":53874.0}

It still has to be confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe county is also awaiting CDC confirmation in a case announced Wednesday involving a person returning from travel in Italy.\n\nThe emergency declaration by Ventura County Public Health Officer Robert Levin labels the spread of virus as an imminent threat. Officials said the decision was triggered by the rise in local cases, the nationwide spread of the novel coronavirus and Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement that scheduled events statewide expected to attract more than 250 people should be canceled or postponed.\n\nCoronavirus: Here's what we know about cancellations, closures in Ventura Count\n\n\"The declaration will enhance our ability to take further lifesaving actions as we continue to respond to this evolving health and safety threat,\" said Ventura County Executive Officer Mike Powers. \"These actions will allow us to have even greater coordination to protect our residents and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We will continue to mobilize county resources, coordinate with agencies and partners and raise awareness about how everyone can take action to be prepared.\"\n\nThe declaration could also bring state and federal funding to aid with the county's response, said Bautista.\n\nPublic health leaders asked businesses, schools and other groups to begin implementing social-distancing plans that involve online classes, work-at-home arrangements and other strategies to limit interaction that can spread viruses.\n\n\"That doesn't mean these places have to close down,\" Bautista said, adding the goal is to come up with ways to limit exposure.\n\nEducation: County universities go online as public schools plan for possible closure\n\nCLOSE The coronavirus is now characterized as a pandemic as the WHO director general announces more than 100,000 cases in over 100 countries.

It involved a returning traveler who spent little time out in the community, meaning the risk of exposure is considered low, said Bautista.\n\nThe case announced Wednesday night involved a county resident who flew into Los Angeles International Airport after traveling to Italy. The traveler sought medical attention at an undisclosed location in Los Angeles County before returning home to Ventura County, said Bautista.\n\nFYI: Here's what we know about higher-risk groups, coronavirus in Ventura County\n\nTesting for the coronavirus was initiated by a health-care provider at an undisclosed site in Los Angeles County.

At least 95 people had been tested in Ventura County.\n\nNewsom's announcement not only calls for gatherings to be canceled but says smaller events should be arranged so people are separated from each other by at least 6 feet.\n\nLevin's local health emergency declaration is set to be considered for ratification by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. Several cities also declared a state of emergency on Thursday and Friday, including Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, Fillmore, Simi Valley, Moorpark and Oxnard.

It is important to mention that the order does not include restaurants, homeless shelter or religious services, as long as these entities adhere to the requirements for social distancing. Currently restaurants are closed for all but take-out, per State Order.Also, the order also does not include schools. In the future, it may be determined that school closures are necessary. Schools, parents and employers should take steps now to prepare for the possibility of prolonged mandatory closures.\n\nWhile being in a state of emergency sounds menacing, it will likely not affect most citizens on a day-to-day basis. The two main things it does are, it makes Alamosa County Public Health and Environment (ACDPHE), incident command and imbues the ACDPHE with the ability to issue orders and guidance to protect public health. And it charges Alamosa\u2019s Sheriff with keeping order and enforcing ACDPHE orders.\n\nBeyond that, the remainder of the declaration is focused on the County Administrator and Emergency Manager working to ensure a strong line of communication and an effective response for the public. All things that will be very helpful helping Alamosa get to May safely.\n\nAt the meeting on Wednesday, Public Information Officer Linda Smith presented first discussing the importance of public information during this trying time.\n\n\u201cWe have been pushing out public information and doing everything that we can to support what the public health agencies are doing,\u201d said Smith. She also discussed a federal government based program that could in the future provide personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves to the valley. However, Smith was sure to make it clear that that was just a possibility and was in no way concrete.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s still very much in the air because we don\u2019t know what that\u2019s going to look like,\u201d Smith went on to reaffirm the importance of information, stating that her office\u2019s focus was shifting away from testing results and more towards paying the current situation the proper respect, adhering to advice coming from proper avenues meaning the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and other reputable sources.\n\nFellow presenter Lilian Coll, Alamosa\u2019s regional epidemiologist, also touched on the hot button issue of test results in Alamosa, confirming that as of press time that there have been five tests from Alamosa that have been sent out and of those one has come back negative. Smith pushed that despite the San Luis Valley still being free of positive cases, that the populace needs to remain vigilant in their hygiene and health practices because COVID-19 is likely present in the valley.\n\nThough not on the agenda, Dr. Bill Brinton MD, internist-general, was in attendance and weighed in on some similar issues, first lamenting the sheer volume of information that is bombarding the public currently before discussing preparedness.\n\n\u201cI do think Alamosa county and the counties of the valley have an advantage,\u201d said Brinton, \u201cBecause we had established plans in place both for bioterrorism starting in 2001 and pandemic influenza starting in 2005, and the planning was well in place by the time the pandemic came in about 2008. We also exercised our plans for the Alamosa Salmonella outbreak around that same time.\u201d\n\nBrinton presented an opportunity to the medical professionals of the valley stating that since we have yet to be infected that we could use this time to look to other counties similar to ours and come up with an effective response. He closed his comments on the current situation by addressing a need for PPE among healthcare workers and ill persons.\n\nSmith addressed the PPE supply chain issues and spoke on a prioritization matrix for that, which the state seems to be doing at the that level as well, which would suggest a possible relief in the future.\n\nAlso presenting to the board was Emergency Manager Eric Treinen. Treinen discussed the transition from an operations center to a Unified Command Group (UCG).

ACDPHE has authority under\n\nstate law to issue orders and guidance, and take other actions as necessary\n\nto protect the public health, safety, and welfare. The Board directs county staff\n\nto take such actions to effectuate the orders and guidance of ACDPHE as\n\nnecessary, in consultation with the Board where appropriate.\n\nTHAT, the Board recognizes the Sheriff of Alamosa County is a\n\nconstitutional officer charged with maintaining public order within Alamosa\n\nCounty and is authorized under state law to enforce the orders of ACCDPHE\n\nas well as other governmental directives related to disasters and emergencies, all\n\nas reasonably necessary to protect the safety of the public. The Board\n\nrequests the Sheriff to enforce the orders of ACDPHE and continue taking\n\nother actions as necessary to ensure the safety of the public during this local\n\ndisaster emergency.\n\nTHAT, the Emergency Manager for Alamosa County is coordinating the\n\ncountywide response to the disaster, including with partners of Alamosa County\n\nsuch as the towns within the county; first responders; human services,\n\nhealthcare and emergency medical services providers; providers of critical\n\ninfrastructure for the community; and other providers of important and\n\nnecessary services to the public.

The\n\nBoard also directs the County Administrator to work with directors and\n\nmanagers within the county to address staff illness, sick time, working\n\nremotely, and similar topics to ensure the continuity of operations within the\n\ncounty in consultation with the Board as appropriate.\n\nTHAT, this local disaster emergency will continue until April 22, 2020, unless\n\nsooner amended, extended, or rescinded by the Board.\n\nTHAT, this Resolution and Declaration shall be promptly filed with the Alamosa\n\nCounty Clerk and Recorder and with the Office of Emergency Management.\n\nTHAT, this Resolution and Declaration is necessary for the public health, safety\n\nand welfare of the citizens of the County of Alamosa, State of Colorado.\n\nPublic Health Order\n\nPursuant to Section 25-1- 506 (2)(a)(I), Colorado Revised Statutes, this Order is effective\n\nwithin the entirety of Alamosa County, including all towns within the county, until April\n\n22, 2020.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, the Governor of Colorado declared a state of emergency related to\n\nthe presence of COVID-19 in the State. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has confirmed that COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the State of\n\nColorado.\n\nOn March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency\n\ndue to COVID-19.\n\nOn March 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance to\n\ncancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States for 8 weeks.\n\nOn March 16, 2020, the President of the United States issued a statement including\n\nrecommendations to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.\n\nThe age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population in Alamosa\n\nCounty places it at risk of serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19.\n\nAlthough most individuals who contract COVID-19 do not become seriously ill, persons\n\nwith mild symptoms and asymptomatic persons with COVID-19 may place other\n\nPUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT\n\nvulnerable members of the public at significant risk. A large surge in the number of\n\npersons with serious infections can compromise the ability of the healthcare system to\n\ndeliver necessary healthcare to the public.\n\nThe limitations on large gatherings and the use of social distancing decrease the risk of\n\nCOVID-19 transmission to our most vulnerable populations, and is especially\n\nimportant for people who are over 60 years old and those with chronic health\n\nconditions due to their higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. This Order\n\nwill reduce the likelihood that many individuals will be exposed to COVID-19 at a single event, and will, therefore, slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.\n\nThis Order is adopted pursuant to the legal authority set forth in sections 25-1-506 and\n\n25-1-508, Colorado Revised Statutes. Under these laws, the local Public Health Director\n\nhas the duty to investigate and control the causes of epidemic or communicable\n\ndiseases and conditions affecting public health and to establish, maintain, and\n\nenforce isolation and quarantine, and in pursuance thereof, and for this purpose only,\n\nto exercise physical control over property and over the persons of the people within the\n\njurisdiction of the agency as the agency may find necessary for the protection of the\n\npublic health. All events must follow the requirements stated herein.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nFor purposes of this Order:\n\nAn \u201cEvent\u201d is a group gathering that takes place indoors or outdoors with a capacity of\n\n30 or more persons and that have 30 or more persons present in one room or\n\ncontinuous space.\n\n\u201cEvent\u201d does not include activities that are primarily individual or occur in small groups\n\nor in non-congregate settings, such as places of employment and restaurants, as long as\n\npersons present are able to maintain adequate social distancing, as well as hygiene and\n\nsanitization recommendations as defined below. At this point, this order also does not\n\npertain to schools or homeless shelters or religious services.\n\nORDER\n\nA. All events 30 people or more are prohibited.\n\nB. Events with fewer than 30 attendees should follow the following steps to mitigate\n\nrisks:\n\n1. Older adults (age 60 and older) and individuals with underlying medical conditions that\n\nare at increased risk of serious COVID-19, including employees, are encouraged not\n\nto attend.\n\n2. Social distancing recommendations should be met. These include limiting contact of people within 6 feet from each other for 10 minutes or longer, and any\n\nother applicable guidance. See Section Ill, below.\n\n3. Individuals who are sick should stay home.\n\n4. Proper hand hygiene and sanitation should be readily available to all\n\nattendees and employees.\n\n5. Environmental cleaning guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and\n\nPrevention (CDC) should be followed (e.g., clean and disinfect high touch\n\nsurfaces daily or more frequently).\n\nFURTHER GUIDANCE\n\nFurther guidelines for social distance are available at:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.colorado.gov\/pacific\/cdphe\/2019 -novel -coronavirus\n\nGENERAL INFORMATION FOR ALL PERSONS AFFECTED BY THIS ORDER\n\nAlamosa County Public Health is tasked with protecting the health and welfare of the citizens of\n\nAlamosa County, Colorado by investigating and controlling the causes of epidemic and communicable\n\ndisease. This Order is necessary to control any potential transmission of disease to others. See section\n\n25-1-508, Colorado Revised Statutes. Immediate issuance of this Order is necessary for the\n\npreservation of public health, safety, or welfare.\n\nAny person aggrieved and affected by this Order has the right to request judicial review by filing an\n\naction with the Alamosa County District Court within 90 days of the date of this Order, pursuant to\n\nsection 25-1-515, Colorado Revised Statutes. However, you must continue to obey the terms of this\n\nOrder while your request for review is pending.\n\nThis Order is in effect until midnight Mountain Standard Time April 22, 2020, and is subject to\n\ncontinuing review by the Public Health Director consistent with recommendations from the\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWe will not be actively searching for violations, but if we receive reports of events contrary to\n\nthis order, we will reach out to the organizer to educate, provide guidance, and enforce the\n\nprovisions of this order, if necessary.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":16253.0}

Then, if a person comes up negative for flu and other diseases, they will be considered positive for COVID-19. That person then would be isolated.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to look at things creatively because of the backlog on tests,\u201d he said.\n\nThe commissioners allocated $500,000 in reserve funds to pay for staff time and supplies used in responding to the crisis.

The commissioners thought a state of emergency was appropriate, not just to address potential community spread of COVID-19, but any subsequent effects.\n\nMost county buildings are closed, but services are still available. The only building that will remain open to the public is the Morgan County Department of Human Services. It will remain open but take preventative measures inside the building and offices.\n\nMany of the services at the county DHS building are to be primarily handled online, by phone and through the mail.\n\nThe Department of Human Services is working on how to adjust many of their programs. They are cutting all non-essential home visits, and people looking for assistance benefits are encouraged to use the online portal at Colorado.gov\/peak.\n\nThe services at the Morgan County Administration Building for motor vehicle services, recording services and election services are available both online and through the mail.\n\nVehicle registration renewals can be done online at mydmv.colorado.gov, by phone at 970-542-3521, through the mail at P.O. Box 1399, Fort Morgan or drop your registration documents and payment at the drop box by the Administration Building in Fort Morgan.\n\nRecording services similarly can be put into the county\u2019s drop box or done online and people are encouraged to call the office for guidance.\n\nVoter registration can be updated at govotecolorado.gov. If the Internet isn\u2019t available, people can call in to the clerk\u2019s office and request registration forms be sent to them.\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s office has suspended all inmate visitations at the Morgan County Jail, and it is giving inmates two free 15-minute phone calls a week to compensate. Besides the distancing, the sheriff\u2019s office are continuing with their normal operations.\n\n\u201cWe are proceeding with normal business, taking necessary precautions for our staff and our inmate welfare,\u201d Sheriff Dave Martin said.\n\nThe Planning and Zoning Department is working on using online forms to aid them in issuing building permits both online and by phone.\n\nOther departments, like the Public Works Department, Finance Department, and the Information Systems Department don\u2019t have much public contact, but they are making sure their workplace habits are hygienic.\n\nThe Information Systems Department is working to keep up to date information on the website while many of their services migrate online. The websites will also host public meetings held by the commissioners while the buildings are closed.\n\nThe resolution to close all buildings passed with 2-1 vote, with Commissioner Jon Becker abstaining.\n\n\u201cI think self-policing is always the best bet,\u201d Commissioner Becker said. \u201cAs we\u2019re dealing with a pandemic, I don\u2019t take that lightly, but I also don\u2019t take lightly the livelihoods of people sitting out there and their ability to know what they can or cannot do.\u201d\n\nThe other two commissioners disagreed, saying that despite the physical closure of the office all services were still available, and that it wouldn\u2019t cause further panic.\n\n\u201cThe county is open. We have limited access, and you\u2019re capable of still completing your business with Morgan County,\u201d Commissioner Jim Zwetzig said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":28404.0}

The order requires residents of Kansas City and Johnson, Jackson and Wyandotte counties to remain at home except for activities \u201cessential to the health and safety\u201d of themselves, family members or friends, such as getting medical attention or food. Residents can also go to work if their employer is deemed an essential business. On Sunday, Leavenworth County issued similar restrictions.\n\nViolations will be considered misdemeanor offenses, punishable by a $500 fine and up to 6 months in jail.\n\nThe order is for 30 days, but could be extended.\n\nThe first Sedgwick County case was reported Thursday as a woman who was over 60.\n\nKansas has seen cases grow by double digits the past three days.\n\nThe 64 confirmed cases do not include two cases in Ford and Miami counties that were diagnosed in out-of-state residents.

The order will include all municipalities. Only banks, grocery stores, liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries, pharmacies and gas stations will remain open.\n\nAccording to a statement from the county, dine-in activity in all restaurants, bars and cafeterias in Summit County will be prohibited beginning at 10 p.m. Monday. Restaurants will be allowed to continue providing delivery and takeout options.\n\n\u201cOur restaurant owners and their employees work hard every day to ensure food safety for their customers by practicing good handwashing, preventing cross contamination and excluding sick employees,\u201d Summit County Public Health Director Amy Wineland said in a news release that confirmed the order to close. \u201cDuring this COVID-19 response, they are working even harder to ensure that the food they produce is safe. Because the primary mode of COVID-19 transmission is person-to-person \u2014 not through the preparation, service and consumption of food \u2014 we believe that take-out and delivery services pose very low risk to the public and serve a critical need in the community.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the Summit Stage and Breckenridge Free Ride bus services will be suspended at the end of service Monday and will not resume until further notice. Ride share services will be permitted to operate until 11:59 p.m. Monday, and service will be suspended afterward.

Food and nonalcoholic beverages also can be delivered.\n\nAs of Monday, Summit County has had two positive cases of COVID-19. The first is still in isolation in the Denver area. The second is in isolation in Frisco. Forty-seven Summit County residents and visitors have been tested. So far, 11 have tested negative, two have tested positive and 34 are still pending.\n\nWith the closures, Summit County joins a number of other communities around the country making changes to business practices in response to the disease, including statewide restaurant and bar closures in California, Illinois, Ohio and more. Breckenridge Town Manager Rick Holman noted that the county\u2019s new restrictions were modeled after similar efforts in Gunnison and Crested Butte.\n\nOn Monday evening, Gov. Jared Polis announced a statewide ban on dine-in restaurants and bars.\n\nMore on COVID-19 The latest Summit County news, how to protect yourself and local resources.\n\nThe suspension in service will last for at least 30 days and will allow for takeout and delivery service.

The the order approved by the council states that the COVID-19 pandemic is a local emergency as defined by the act.\n\nCity Manager Scott Moore stressed to the Pioneer that it does not mean Yuma has an emergency at this time. He said it means that with the declaration in place, if quarantine measures do have to be implemented in Yuma, another council meeting does not have to be called to enact the emergency declaration.\n\nThe city council is not going to have a meeting for the next three weeks, having canceled its regular meeting on April 7. That cancellation does not have to do with COVID-19, but rather is routinely done when a council meeting falls on the day of a municipal election. Normally, those meetings are rescheduled for the following Thursday. However, it appears there will not be much on the agenda anyway, so the council has canceled that meeting, with the next one set for April 21, at which point the new council will be sworn-in.\n\n\n\nThe local emergency declaration does activate another section of the municipal code, 2.08.040 (anyone can read the municipal code at the city of Yuma website, yumacolo.org.). It does grant the city manager the authority to approve contracts during the local emergency for up to $100,000, but that the contracts \u201care reasonably related to the local emergency.\u201d The city manager also is to provide the city council a summary of all contracts approved, including the name of the contractors, the amount of the contract, and the purpose of the contract, on a daily basis.\n\nIt also opens the door to closing streets, sidewalks and parks and \u201cto delineate areas within the City wherein an emergency exists.\u201d\n\nIt also conceivably could result in the city ordering the closing of business establishments within the city for the period of the emergency. (The state of Colorado already has done this in regards to restaurants, bars and movie theaters.)\n\nAll of that and more is in the municipal code, but does not mean it all will be implemented, or that there will ever be a need to activate the emergency.\n\nAlso, the declaration is temporary, and would require council\u2019s approval to extend it for a longer duration of time.\n\nCouncilman Dan Baucke voiced concerns over some of the language in the code, Tuesday night, but Mayor Ron Swehla said to trust the city manager.\n\n","category":"None","population":10151.0}

The company, Metro Cruise Services, said the employees provided embarkation services at various cruise terminals in Port Everglades.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health is urging anyone who recently traveled through Port Everglades to isolate themselves for 14 days if they start experiencing symptoms.\n\nOfficials confirmed the company connection in a news release that also said a 69-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 is the fourth Broward County resident, and third employee of Metro Cruise Services, to have the virus.\n\n\"We were unaware that any of our part-time employees were sick until we were notified by the authorities,\u201d Metro Cruise Services President Anthony Newman said in a statement. \"We then immediately notified all of our Port Everglades employees that one of their associates had tested positive and advised them that, if they have any symptoms, they should seek medical assistance and not report to work.\"\n\nThe health department advisory asks anyone who passed through the port in Fort Lauderdale to isolate themselves and contact their county health department or health care provider if they start experiencing symptoms of the virus, which includes a cough, fever and shortness of breath.\n\nNBC 6 Investigator Tony Pipitone reports on the coronavirus' impact on the cruise industry.\n\nThat conforms with new guidelines issued Monday by the CDC, which advises recent cruise passengers to monitor their health for 14 days, immediately self-isolate if they experience symptoms, and contact medical professionals for treatment.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, but it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia in older adults and people with existing health problems. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus within weeks.\n\nSwift-moving developments over the new coronavirus ricocheted across Florida\u2019s Capitol as Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Monday and lawmakers disrupted their legislative session so crews in surgical gowns could swab down the House chambers. DeSantis said his declaration would enable Florida to better marshal resources and get outside help as it confronts the growing public health crisis.\n\nFlorida Department of Health\n\n\"That allows us to create a unified command structure, it also allows, if need be, out-of-state medical personnel to operate in Florida,\" DeSantis said at a news conference Monday evening. \"It allows us to more swiftly purchase any necessary supplies including masks and materials and equipment necessary to set up field hospitals. It allows pharmacists to dispense up to 30-day emergency prescription refill of maintenance medication.\"\n\nHealth officials are trying to connect with all employees of Metro Cruise Services who may have come into contact with the three infected co-workers. The agency announced earlier that three Broward County men, ages 65, 67 and 75, had tested positive; the news release didn't specify which of these men are the other two company employees.\n\nTwo cruise ships that left from Fort Lauderdale \u2014 the Regal Princess and the Caribbean Princess \u2014 were later issued \u201cno sail\" orders by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after crew members who had possibly been exposed on a California ship were tested.\n\nThe Regal Princess eventually docked at the port late Sunday and passengers were able to leave the ship. The Caribbean Princess stopped briefly in Grand Cayman on Monday to pick up test kits for two crew members. The ship is sailing off Florida's coast until it gets the all clear.\n\nAlso, late Monday, state health officials reported that a 60-year-old Volusia County woman tested positive, bringing the state's total to 20. Of those, two people have died. Fourteen of the 20 cases were diagnosed in Florida and five in another state, officials said. In addition, a California resident, now under self-isolation in Florida, has tested positive.\n\nFor more information on coronavirus in Florida, visit Floridahealth.org\/covid-19","category":"state_of_emergency","population":1838844.0}

Neighboring Santa Rosa County had its first last week.\n\nOn top of permitted events, Pensacola also canceled all facility reservations and rentals with more than 50 people.\n\nOfficials will reassess the situation in eight weeks following the guidelines issued from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe county also activated its Emergency Operations Center on Monday afternoon.\n\n\"We are proactively activating the EOC and declaring a local state of emergency to ensure we have the appropriate resources for this unprecedented event, \" Escambia County Emergency Manager Eric Gilmore said in a county press release. \"We encourage the public to follow CDC guidance for social distancing and proper health and hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Escambia County.\"\n\nOn top of events that have already been canceled, the city's planned Census 2020 Kick-Off Event on Wednesday and AARP tax-aide services at the Pensacola Library, Molino Branch Library and Southwest Branch Library have been canceled.\n\nCity parks will remain open, but all programs are being suspended, with the exception of the city's spring break programs for school-aged children and senior citizen meal program done in partnership with the Council on Aging of West Florida. City community centers will be closed to the public.\n\nThe county's community centers remain open at this point, but the county will likely be closing them soon, county spokeswoman Laura Coale said Monday.\n\nThe city is working with the Council on Aging to transition the senior meal program to some type of take-out or home delivery system.\n\nLater in the day, the CDC issued another revision to its guidelines and called for communities to limit gatherings of people to 10 or less.\n\nEscambia County Administrator Janice Gilley told the News Journal she would have to speak with commissioners to decide how the county would respond.\n\n\"This is a very fluid incident,\" Gilley said. \"And so I think it would be very difficult to make any definitive statements at this moment, because as you saw today, we went from 50 before 8 a.m., to the president speaking about 10 in a gathering at 2:30 pm. So, I don't want to make a definitive statement about that yet until we can have a chance to see what the impact is in Escambia County.\"\n\nRobinson said at this time, he would not be ordering any restaurants or other businesses to close, but said that could change, especially if the Pensacola area sees community spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"Community spread is important,\" Robinson said. \"Obviously, if we get to that point, it'll change what we end up doing. But at this point, we do not see community spread. So, the things we're implementing in the way we go about, day to day, in Escambia County, at this point is because of that. If things change, we will change, and we will probably institute new policies.\"\n\nIn addition to the Escambia County case announced Monday afternoon, the Florida Department of Health announced four new cases of the virus in the state, bringing the total number of cases in Florida to 159. So far, four people have died in Florida due to the coronavirus, including a man in Santa Rosa .\n\nUntil Monday, it was difficult to get a coronavirus test in the area, with local doctors advising patients with symptoms to stay home and self-quarantine as a test was not available.\n\nThe first drive-thru testing clinic was opened Monday and the Ascension Sacred Heart call center received 211 calls by 10:30 a.m. Monday and directed 51 people to get the test in just 90 minutes after pre-screening their symptoms.\n\nDuring his morning press conference, Robinson said he believes there are probably people in the community who have the virus and are not showing symptoms, but defended his position of not taking further action until there was community spread of the virus.\n\n\"We haven't gotten to that stage at this particular time,\" Robinson said. \"Again, other communities, both within the United States and the state of Florida are already there. We are not there. That doesn't say we won't get there. But we are positioning ourselves with certain thresholds. When we hit those thresholds, we will institute new policies.\"\n\nAlthough there were no cases yet confirmed, Robinson said small businesses, especially restaurant owners, should begin planning for the worst.\n\n\"If we reach a certain impact, I would tell restaurants to begin to think how they can either provide food for delivery or take-out in the event that something does happen with community spread,\" Robinson said. \"Again, anything can change, and we will change with the circumstances.\"\n\nRobinson said he would be drafting a letter to the state and the federal government requesting a financial assistance program for workers who miss out on work because of closures related to the coronavirus.\n\n\"Even though there'll be this period of slowdown, we want them to be able to keep their job as best they can,\" Robinson said.\n\nJim Little can be reached at jwlittle@pnj.com or 850-208-9827.\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.pnj.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/16\/coronavirus-pensacola-cancels-event-permits-facility-reservations-50-people\/5058562002\/","category":"state_of_emergency","population":305817.0}

The number of people that authorities are saying constitutes too many has changed rapidly \u2014 an example of how quickly recommended responses to the virus have shifted.\n\n\"Something I\u2019ve told you is probably wrong by now because things are changing so quickly,\" Lord said toward the end of his presentation.\n\n\"This time last week, the guidance was mass gatherings of more than a 1,000 should not occur,\" Lord said. \"This weekend it became 250, as of the president on the news an hour ago, it is down to 10. ... He really wants people to stay home. He\u2019s saying avoid bars, food courts, restaurants.\"\n\nAnd that doesn't just go for people who feel sick: People can contract COVID-19 and remain asymptomatic \u2014 showing no symptoms \u2014 all the while passing the disease to others. So it helps slow the disease's transmission if even people who feel healthy avoid unnecessary gatherings.\n\nAlso over the weekend, Florida Department of Health-Flagler County Administrator Bob Snyder told the commission, the number of known cases in Florida jumped from 42 to 137; as of the evening of March 16, it was 142.\n\nBut, Snyder said, \"I feel like this weekend was pivotal,\" because in the county and local cities, he said, \"actions have been taken to cancel small or large gatherings.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s what mitigation is all about,\" Snyder said. \"If that continues, I think we have a high, high chance ... that we\u2019ll be successful in watching this virus die. ... We\u2019ve got to keep that up, and encourage that in addition to everyday good hygiene.\"\n\nStill, he said, \"At some point in time, we will have our first confirmed case of COVID-19. When? Don\u2019t know.\"\n\nBut the state will soon \u2014 likely by the end of the week \u2014 have the capacity to test as many as 625,000 people, he said, with assistance from LabCorps, Quest, various other private testing labs and AdventHealth's lab in Orlando.\n\n\"We know what to do. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we\u2019ll be on it.\" \u2014 BOB SNYDER, Florida Department of Health-Flagler administrator\n\nThat will likely mean an uptick in known positive cases.\n\nOnce there's a positive case in Flagler County, the health department will take the lead: Its nurses will interview the patient to determine who they've been in contact with over the 14-day period in which they may have contracted or been shedding the virus, and will then contact those people to see if they're sick and who they've been in contact with.\n\nThat process is called \"contact tracing,\" and the health department is accustomed to using it for other illnesses, such as HIV.\n\n\"I want our community to know, we know what to do,\" Snyder said. \"We are used to doing this. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we\u2019ll be on it.\"\n\nLord and Snyder have will also hold a phone meeting with assisted living facilities and nursing homes later this week, Lord said, as seniors are at heightened risk from the disease. The facilities have already started reducing visits, Snyder said.\n\nThe county is also shutting down nonessential services, such as the county library, while working to provide help to people who had relied on county services that are being reduced or shut down \u2014 for instance, the county's adult daycare program, or meals provided at the Wickline Center (which are now being delivered to individuals' homes).

Retail and office tenants are expected to ask their landlords for rent breaks as their April 1 payment due date approaches.\n\nMalls in South Florida, such as Bal Harbour Shops, Brickell City Centre, Aventura Mall and all Simon-owned properties, had already announced they planned to close before Gimenez\u2019s announcement. Major retailers such as Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale\u2019s and Macy\u2019s had also stated they were closing.\n\nAll parks and beaches in Miami-Dade were instructed to close as of Thursday morning, the mayor said in his daily webcast.\n\nIn Florida, 390 people have Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, according to the Miami Herald.

Not until he gets that list later this week will he decide on furloughs.\n\nThe local emergency declaration allows Beasley to act on matters that would normally require county commission approval, County Attorney Michael Craig said. That includes purchasing decisions and providing emergency residential facilities and warehousing.\n\nThe emergency period can last only seven days but can be extended repeatedly by the county manager, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s anticipated it will need to be extended multiple times,\u201d Craig said.\n\nThe extensions are subject to commission approval at its next regular meeting, Beasley said.\n\nIn other business, the commission approved extending its annual property insurance coverage for another year at $1.8 million, a roughly 6% increase over the current policy. It will cover all county buildings, which are valued at $850 million, said Mark Thomas, the county\u2019s risk manager.\n\nThe insurance plan coverage was scheduled to increase 10% to $1.9 million, but the county reduced some coverage limits in line with neighboring counties and cities, Thomas said.\n\nKevin Bouffard can be reached at kevin.bouffard@theledger.com or at 863-802-7591.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":623009.0}

The Beach has not made an arrest related to violation of the governor\u2019s order about social distancing at the beach.\n\nThe city has been seeing some minor incidents, such as traffic issues and arguments, with people under 18 from Putnam County who are on spring break.\n\nThe Putnam County Sheriff\u2019s Office plans to send officers to help St. Augustine Beach because of that, Hardwick said.\n\nAs for business on the beach, Hardwick said St. Augustine Beach technically doesn\u2019t have bars. But there are restaurants that serve alcohol, according to state standards based on the volume of food versus alcohol sales, he said.\n\nThe city hasn\u2019t ordered any businesses to stop serving alcohol, he said.\n\nSt. Augustine Beach hasn\u2019t seen extra issues with alcohol being served, and the dynamic at the beach is different than in the city of St. Augustine, Hardwick said. St. Augustine ordered restaurants to stop serving alcohol temporarily.\n\nHardwick and Cmdr. Thomas Ashlock have visited all of the restaurants in the city and provided them a copy of DeSantis\u2019 order and information on how to comply with new guidelines for restaurants.\n\nMost of the restaurants were already in compliance, and some are taking extra steps to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, he said.\n\n\"Our businesses and our community have been so good over here,\" Hardwick said.","category":"None","population":209647.0}

We believe most of these things are issues that will provide some protections to our county staff and citizens.\"\n\nThe emergency declaration also moves a number of previously scheduled county government planning meetings, and cancels all meetings of volunteer boards and committees until May 1.\n\nThe scheduling of county commission meetings wasn\u2019t specifically addressed in connection with the emergency declaration, although some commissioners did wonder about potential problems with commission meetings that might attract more than 50 people.\n\nThe emergency declaration has to be revisited every seven days, according to information from the Monday meeting, with either the chairman, the commission or the county administrator making decisions on its continuance.\n\nIn addition to the emergency declaration, the county will allow employees who can work from home to do so \"to provide that safety for our staff and our visitors,\" Jones said.\n\nMonday\u2019s meeting might not be the last time that commissioners are assembled to consider coronavirus-related action, Chapman told his colleagues Monday.\n\n\"This stuff is very fluid, it changes almost every few hours,\" Chapman said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":59807.0}

Kemp. \u201cThis measure is critical to reducing local transmission in communities across our state, and I ask Georgians to continue to follow best practices \u2013 washing their hands regularly, isolating the elderly and chronically ill, and avoiding large events if possible \u2013 in the days and weeks ahead.\u201d\n\nGrady County school superintendent Dr. Kermit Gilliard had called a special meeting of the school system administrators and directors on Friday to discuss closing the school system for students on March 16. Students had already been out of class since March 11, with March 12 and 13 being teacher workdays and professional development days.\n\nAll of the systems in southwest Georgia and most in the state had already announced plans to close this week with the blessings of the governor.\n\nAfter the General Assembly granted the governor with emergency powers to deal with the health crisis on Monday, Kemp took action to close all schools statewide through March 31.\n\nGrady County Schools were previously scheduled to be closed the week of April 6-10 for spring break. Dr. Gilliard and his administrative staff met again Tuesday and the superintendent announced his decision not to reopen the schools on April 1 just to close two days later for a week.\n\n\u201cThere are too many families who have plans or reservations that have been long-standing for the spring break holiday. No one hates that our students are missing so many weeks of instruction more than I, but this is the right decision under the circumstances. I\u2019m just hopeful the crisis will have subsided and we can return to school on April 13,\u201d Dr. Gilliard said.\n\nThe superintendent on Friday was hesitant to close the local schools since no confirmed cases of the virus had been reported here, but with every other system in the region and the majority in the state planning to close it was not practical to remain open. Governor Kemp\u2019s action this week made that tough decision more palatable, according to Dr. Gilliard.\n\nUnder the original plan, 11- and 12-month contracted personnel were to remain on the job and school system janitorial personnel were to spend additional time cleaning and disinfecting school buildings. Teachers reported to work Monday and Tuesday and prepared packets of instructional materials to be distributed to students on Tuesday and for high school students on Wednesday. Teachers were also encouraged to use the time to clean out their rooms of accumulated, unused materials.\n\nGrady County School System assistant superintendent Janet Walden encouraged principals to coordinate with their school media centers to distribute surplus books that were scheduled to be purged from the collection to students for their enlightenment.\n\nIn light of the governor\u2019s order Monday, school administrators will assist with the school system\u2019s food distribution program, but will not be required to work the remainder of the day. Phone calls to schools will be routed to the school system central office where personnel there will have a rotating work schedule and will answer calls through April 3.\n\n\u201cMany people are very anxious about this situation and we realize many school activities and events have been canceled and many cannot be rescheduled at this point. We remain hopeful that we can proceed with graduation on May 23,\u201d Dr. Gilliard said.\n\nThe state has also suspended the Milestones Test and High School End of Course exams until further notice.\n\nReport cards for the third nine-weeks grading period were scheduled to be distributed this week, however, the school superintendent said that report cards would be held and distributed to students when schools are tentatively scheduled to reopen on April 13.","category":"school_business_closure","population":25278.0}

The Council had only two agenda items to discuss\u2014temporarily limiting public access to City Hall and a state of emergency resolution.\n\nPrior to a more than one-hour public discussion of the draft emergency resolution, the Council unanimously voted to close City Hall to the public until further notice, beginning at noon today. This follows earlier proactive steps taken by the city to prevent further spread of the Coronavirus by limiting public access at City Hall; encouraging online and payment drop-off options; and creating a virtual option for the March 19 Council meeting.\n\nMayor Sam Norton said, \u201cAs a small city, it\u2019s critical that we keep our staff healthy to ensure continued services to our residents. We continue to closely monitor this situation with the help of our state and federal partners, but working together, we\u2019ll all get through this.\u201d\n\nThe draft emergency resolution is similar to actions taken across Georgia in communities, both rural and metropolitan, and in communities with confirmed diagnoses as well as communities with no confirmed cases. By declaring a state of emergency, it allows city officials to take necessary steps to ensure the overall health and welfare of city residents.\n\n\u201cThis action isn\u2019t something that we take lightly,\u201d said Mayor Sam Norton. \u201cNone of us support government overreach, but in times like this, local governments must be empowered to take decisive actions when it comes to the public health and safety.\u201d\n\nAmong the emergency measures to be considered by the Council during its next special called meeting on Wednesday, March 25 at 4:00 p.m.:\n\nPermitting boards, commissions and agencies of the city to conduct meetings and take votes by teleconference.\n\nAllowing the city manager, with approval of the mayor, to take necessary actions to protect the public health and safety including temporary closures of city facilities, cancelling certain city functions, and allowing staff and business to be conducted at alternative locations among other administrative and emergency actions necessary to protect the public health and perform essential functions.\n\nRequiring restaurants to suspend dine-in services, but permitting delivery, drive-thru, or take-out services and to have patrons, employees and contractors maintain at least six (6) feet of personal distance.\n\nRequiring gyms, fitness centers, and other high-contact business models to suspend daily operations.\n\nProhibiting public and private gatherings of more than 10 people, occurring outside a household (this provision would not prevent of business activity or the delivery of medical and other health services unless otherwise specified).\n\nFurther establishing the administrative succession roles, following the City Charter and current form of government, by designating the finance director to succeed the city manager if he is unable to perform his duties and if both the city manager and the finance director are unable to perform these duties, the mayor as chief executive officer of the city will assume the city manager duties.\n\nResidents and business owners who would like to share feedback regarding the proposed emergency resolution can send comments to the City by email at customerservice@dahlonega.gov.\n\nThe possible state of emergency follows the Council\u2019s March 19, 2020 special called meeting where the City Council unanimously approved two measures that assist with city efforts in responding to COVID-19 (Coronavirus). Those measures included a comprehensive employee telecommuting policy and a temporary moratorium on special event applications. Effective March 20, the city is no longer accepting new special event applications until further notice.\n\nAs part of these recent changes, all non-essential city staff will immediately shift to remote worksites, telecommuting from their homes.\n\n\u201cAll essential city services continue to operate uninterrupted at this time,\u201d said City Manager Bill Schmid. \u201cShifting non-essential employees out of our city facilities helps us limit potential exposure to essential staff, protecting their and the public\u2019s health and working to ensure we can continue our core services.\u201d\n\nThe Dahlonega Downtown Development Authority (DDA) recently notified city businesses that State of Georgia received its approved emergency declaration, making small businesses eligible to apply for Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration.

A note posted on the theatre's door says they are close and all shows are postponed. AP Photo\n\nGeorgia's governor said Monday that he was ordering all bars and nightclubs in the state to close because of the coronavirus and giving state officials the authority to shut down businesses that don't comply as the number of infections confirmed statewide reached 800.\n\nThe order will take effect at noon Tuesday and last for just under two weeks, Gov. Brian Kemp said at a news conference. He said the state would also ban gatherings of 10 or more people unless people could maintain a distance of 6 feet (2 meters). Kemp's announcement did not mention restaurants.\n\n\u201cThese measures are intended to ensure the health and safety of Georgians across our state,\" he said. \u201cAnd I would ask for everyone\u2019s cooperation over the next two weeks.\u201d\n\nThe measures fall short of orders issued in other states and what some lawmakers and health experts had sought. Indiana, Michigan and West Virginia joined states including California, Illinois and New York in asking or ordering their residents to stay home and keep businesses closed \u2014 directives that now cover more than one-third of the U.S. population.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nKemp said he would order people at increased risk from the virus to shelter in place. That population includes people in long-term care facilities, those with chronic lung disease and those undergoing cancer treatment, he said.\n\nThe restrictions in Georgia came as the number of cases of the virus in the state rose Monday evening to 800. The death toll rose to 26, increasing by one from Sunday. Kemp also joined several other governors in sending a letter to leaders in Congress asking that they approve additional funding to states in the form of block grants to fight the virus.\n\nKemp had previously ordered schools to close but refrained from taking stronger steps, leaving those decisions to local governments instead. Individual counties in Georgia have placed restrictions on businesses and gatherings.\n\nThe CEO of Metro Atlanta's DeKalb County, Michael Thurmond, issued an executive order Monday that prohibits gatherings of 10 or more people, closes playgrounds and asks all residents to shelter in place \u201cas much as possible.\u201d Beginning Tuesday, the order stipulates that restaurants and bars are prohibited from having dine-in service and businesses such as bowling alleys, nail salons and barbers are limited to a maximum occupancy of 10 people.\n\nDeKalb joins several counties including Athens-Clarke County, home to the University of Georgia, as well as hard-hit Dougherty County in southwest Georgia in implementing restrictions.\n\nDougherty County, where Albany is the county seat, continues to have the worst confirmed infection rate statewide. Its 64 cases are more than 10 times the positive rate statewide. Other counties with high infection rates include Bartow County in northwest Georgia and Lee County, a suburban neighbor of Dougherty County.\n\nOn Sunday, the mayor and county commission chairman issued an executive order making the conditions of a shelter-in-place order there more stringent, including requiring essential businesses such as grocery stores not to exceed 50% occupancy.\n\nAlbany Mayor Bo Dorough said during a news conference Monday that surrounding counties need to take similar precautions.\n\n\u201cCounty lines are really nothing more than a place in the sand,\u201d Dorough said. \"This virus is totally indifferent to county boundaries. So if people are coming into Albany to shop and to work, there have to be precautions taken in our surrounding counties.\u201d\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nOf those who died, the youngest two were 42 and the oldest two were 85, with an average age of 66, according to Department of Public Health records. Dougherty County has recorded six deaths, while Cobb County has five. No other county has more than two.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia Ports Authority executive director Griff Lynch said Monday that he was still hopeful a drop in cargo volumes would be just a short-term \u201cblip\u201d that would end by May. Lynch said cargo containers moving through the Port of Savannah appear to be down about 20% compared with last March. That\u2019s because fewer imports are coming from China after the virus forced manufacturers to shut down.\n\nCargo shipped from Asia is already starting to rebound, Lynch said. But now he\u2019s watching U.S. retailers. If stores are closed for extended periods and their inventories pile up, Lynch said, \u201cwe may not see the impact of that until the summertime.\u201d\n\nAt least four members of the Georgia state Senate have now tested positive after Republican Sen. Brandon Beach of Alpharetta became the first to do so last week. Republican Sen. Kay Kirkpatrick of Marietta, Republican Sen. Bruce Thompson of White and Democratic Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta have announced positive diagnoses. Williams is also the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.\n\nThompson said he was released from Northside Cherokee hospital Sunday after a period in the intensive care unit.\n\n\u201cWhile I am feeling much better, I plan to remain at home in self-quarantine for the immediate future,\u201d Thompson wrote on Facebook.","category":"None","population":14009.0}

Kemp issued multiple executive orders and asked for the public\u2019s help to ensure everyone is following CDC and Georgia Department of Health (DPH) guidelines during the country\u2019s self-quarantine.\n\nWhile Kemp is still hesitant to shut down all non-essential businesses or institute a statewide mandatory quarantine, he did issue an executive order to all medically fragile individuals to shelter in place. He listed off these individuals: the elderly, underlying conditions, cancer patients, or anyone suspected of having COVID-19.\n\nIn another executive order, Kemp closed all bars and nightclubs in the state and banned large gatherings (more than 10).\n\nKemp also said to fellow Georgians that if they see anyone not following the CDC of DPH guidelines, \u201ccall them out or report them to us.\u201d He seemed prepared to take action against anyone not listening to his instructions or taking COVID-19 seriously.\n\n\u201cFight this virus with everything you got,\u201d stated Kemp toward the end of his press conference.\n\nGeorgians can also call the DPH COVID-19 hotline at (844) 442-2681.

Kemp (@GovKemp) March 23, 2020\n\n\n\nUpdate from March 15, 2020 below\n\nGov. Kemp, Georgia Department of Health (DPH), and Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) started construction of a quarantine zone in Monroe County on March 14, 2020. Additionally, the Georgia General Assembly ratified the executive order declaring a Public Health State of Emergency.\n\n\u201cThis is one of many measures that we\u2019re taking to prepare for any scenario,\u201d said Gov. Kemp. \u201cI appreciate the hard work of GEMA, DPH, and Monroe County officials to protect the health and safety of all Georgians.\u201d\n\nThe quarantine space is for people who are unable to self-isolate and is located in the Georgia Public Safety Training Center (GPSTC) Campus in Monroe County. The quarantine space will be able to accommodate twenty temporary housing units. No patients are currently located at the facility.\n\nMonroe County is working with the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA\/HS) and GPSTC officials to ensure the facility will meet the needs of potential patients while protecting the health and safety of Monroe County residents.\n\nPublic Health Emergency Ratification\n\nKemp can now officially enforce all laws, rules, and regulations associated with the emergency; assume control of all state civil forces and helpers; seize property temporarily for public\u2019s protection; exercise other duties deemed necessary for safety; use all the resources available of the state government; direct evacuation; suspend of alcohol, explosives, and combustibles; and provide temporary housing if applicable.\n\nSince this is a public health emergency, Kemp also has the ability to \u201cimplement a mandatory vaccination or quarantine\u201d in accordance with O.C.G.A. Code 38-3-51(i)(2). The Georgia Department of Health (DPH) already has this capability to mandate quarantine and vaccinations.\n\nAdditionally, Kemp can direct DPH\u2019s efforts to coordinate the department\u2019s response to the crisis from risk assessments, mitigation, responses, and recovery throughout the state.\n\nThe General Assembly also granted Kemp the ability to extend the state of emergency if the elected representative body can\u2019t convene in time.\n\nOriginal Article:\n\nOn Saturday morning, Governor Brian Kemp officially declared Georgia\u2019s first Public Health Emergency, freeing up resources and granting additional powers to Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA). The General Assembly will vote on the executive order on Monday.\n\nA Public Health Emergency is enacted when an infectious disease\/illness presents an imminent threat and can potentially result in a high number of deaths and\/or exposure could harm large amounts of people.\n\nSo, what exactly does this executive order entail for Georgians? In short, it guarantees a continuous supply of medical goods and other emergency materials, as well as giving DPH and GEMA powers to \u201ctaken any action necessary to protect the public\u2019s health\u201d with the governor\u2019s permission.\n\nThe department of public health is authorized to \u201cactively monitor\u201d persons under investigation (PUI), including a risk assessment within 24 hours of identification, and twice-daily temperature checks for 14 days or until a negative test result.\n\nHere\u2019s the entire executive order for those who want to review it.\n\nThese actions include \u201cimplementing quarantine, isolation, and other necessary public health interventions in accordance with O.C.G.A. Code 31-12-4 and Code 38-3-51(i)(2) or as other authorized by law.\n\nO.C.G.A. Code 31-12-4 addresses isolation and segregation of diseased persons stating the DPH and county boards can isolate or quarantine individuals suspected of harboring infectious diseases, or until they test negative for the contagion. The department also must widely publicize the rules and regulations for the quarantine. O.C.G.A. Code 38-3-51(i)(2) lists the due processes afforded to those in quarantine and seeks to leave before the department of public health gives the okay.\n\nAdditionally, the Georgia Emergency Operations Plan is activated. DPH and GEMA must coordinate with state, federal, and local government, recovery operations, mitigation, emergency response activities, CDC, and the release of the national stockpile of goods.\n\nThe public must also be informed about public health operations, including education and prevention measures.\n\nCommercial vehicles have certain restrictions lifted, so they can operate more freely to move supplies throughout the state.\n\nGeorgia Board of Nurses and Georgia Composite Medical Board can grant temporary licenses to applicants that are in good standing with an equivalent board in another state.\n\nAll state and local healthcare facilities, physicians, clinics, and personnel must comply with the governor\u2019s orders.\n\nPrice gouging on products on goods and services necessary in this public health emergency is prohibited.\n\nThe Georgia National Guard was called in on March 14 to assist in the crisis.\n\nThe executive order expires on April 13, 2020, unless Gov.

She has been hospitalized and is listed in stable condition.\n\nRon Nunziato, CEO of Extended Care LLC, the consulting company working with Chateau, said the facility is following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Illinois Department of Public Health and the county health department.\n\n\"As always, our residents' health, safety and well-being is our highest priority,\" he said. \"We anticipated it wasn't if, it was when, a resident would become affected.\"\n\nHe said the center previously implemented increased infection prevention practices and strategies, including symptom screening of staff and residents, enhanced environmental cleaning and disinfection, and visitor screening and restrictions.\n\n\"We believe that because of the proactive approach to this crisis, we were able to identify this quickly,\" Nunziato added.\n\nThe center is working with state and county health authorities to promptly identify and monitor people who have had recent contact with the resident, he said.\n\nKaren Ayala, executive director of the DuPage County Health Department, said the agency has been monitoring COVID-19 since late January.\n\n\"We expected to see cases here,\" she said. \"We have been talking about the eventuality of what happened yesterday, and we are absolutely not surprised nor are we panicked with this news.\"\n\nThe department has worked closely with schools, community organizations and health care providers to highlight prevention steps, including washing hands, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home while sick, Ayala said.\n\nIn the meantime, Cronin said the county's health department and office of homeland security and emergency management are available to help local leaders coordinate municipal responses.\n\nAs part of the response, Cronin said, Comcast has pledged to make hi-speed data service available for 60 days to low-income families who do not have the company's internet service in their homes.\n\nComcast also has opened its Wi-Fi access points across DuPage County for subscribers and nonsubscribers at thousands of points throughout the county.

Phil Murphy speaks during a news conference | AP Photo Murphy directs New Jersey businesses to close amid fight against coronavirus\n\nNew Jersey is closed for business.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy issued a pair of executive orders Saturday afternoon directing residents to stay indoors, shut down most of the state\u2019s retail shops and wipe away the \u201cpatchwork\u201d of county and local regulations that have emerged over the last three weeks in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe orders follow similar directives from fellow Democrats California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf as reports of new cases continue to sweep across the U.S. with a boom in testing.\n\nWhile Murphy\u2019s executive order isn\u2019t identical to those issued in other states, the underlying message is the same: Stay home.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t take these measures lightly, nor do we take them easily,\u201d said Murphy, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association. He said he wanted to make sure he and his staff had addressed \u201cevery aspect of daily life\u201d in crafting the order. \u201cWe wanted to make sure we got this right at the first go.\u201d\n\nAs of Saturday, 1,327 people have tested positive for coronavirus in New Jersey, 442 of whom had their test results reported to the state Department of Health between Friday and Saturday afternoon. Five more deaths have been linked to Covid-19 in New Jersey, the governor said Saturday, bringing the total to 16.\n\nNon-essential businesses have to close their doors by 8 p.m. Saturday and there's no end in sight.\n\nStill, the shutdown order specifically allows a sweeping array of businesses to keep operating, including everything from grocery stores, farmers markets and farms that sell food directly to customers to pharmacies and medical marijuana dispensaries to hardware stores, laundromats and stores that principally sell supplies for children under five years old.\n\nAnother industry spared: liquor stores.\n\nHealth care and social services will have to remain accessible, Murphy said, adding that other industries like manufacturing, trucking and construction will also be able to stay open.\n\nResidents will be required to stay from home unless they are reporting to work, buying groceries, exercising or a handful of other exceptions.\n\nOffices will have to allow their employees to work from home \u201cwherever possible,\u201d Murphy said. The order grants State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan the power to add more businesses to the list of those that must suspend operations at their brick-and-mortar locations.\n\n\u201cWe want you to assume everything that\u2019s not on that list is non-essential,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIf you are a business that makes something, or if you\u2019re a business of any sort, that we didn\u2019t ask to be closed down \u2014 you have to have 100 percent work from home policies in place.\u201d\n\nCallahan, who also spoke at the Saturday press conference, said residents found to have violated the order can be charged with disorderly persons offenses.\n\nWith New Jersey likely weeks away from approaching an anticipated surge in coronavirus-related hospitalizations, the governor offered no timeline for how long his executive order will remain in effect.\n\nMurphy, along with New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli, has also been working to reopen shuttered hospitals and medical facilities to prepare for the wave of patients suffering from respiratory problems linked to Covid-19.\n\nIn daily media briefings, Persichilli has repeatedly emphasized the state lacks the supplies, beds and workforce to account for a surge.\n\nNew Jersey has taken incremental steps toward Murphy\u2019s \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order over the last week, rolling out increasingly restrictive directives that shuttered some of the state\u2019s largest businesses, including malls and casinos, as well as consumer-facing shops like salons and tattoo parlors.\n\nCounty and local officials, particularly those in North Jersey, have been pushing stringent recommendations and, in some cases, directives for residents to remain at home.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a patchwork of regulations that change from one twon or one county to another,\u201d Murphy said at Saturday\u2019s press conference. \u201cFolks\u2019 hearts are in the right place. That\u2019s not the question. But we have got to run this state with one set of rules.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s orders arrived as the state announced a 50 percent increase in the total number of coronavirus patients statewide, which Murphy attributed to a combination of community spread and expanded access to testing.\n\n\u201cCould we have done this yesterday? Yeah, we probably could have, but the fact of the matter is, I think we landed in a really good place of what we\u2019re deeming essential and non-essential,\u201d Murphy said at the press conference. \u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot more we can do, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe reserve the right [to do more], if something does come up where we think we can make a meaningful difference,\u201d he added.","category":"school_business_closure","population":22641.0}

Trustees then extended the state of emergency until the end of the next village board meeting. O'Hara was the only elected official to attend the meeting in person.\n\n\"The Illinois Department of Public Health has now confirmed localized community person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in Illinois, significantly increasing the risk of exposure and infection to Illinois' general public, and creating an extreme public health risk in the village and throughout the state,\" O'Hara said, in the declaration.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. Wednesday, there were 22 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, among Lake County residents, according to the Lake County Health Department. The department learned of the first infected county resident a week earlier.\n\n\"As has been experienced in other locales in the United States and around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to infect large numbers of people in a short amount of time, placing extreme burdens on the health care system and the economy,\" O'Hara declared.\n\nIn her first set of emergency orders, O'Hara mandated the closure of all physical fitness facilities and membership sports and recreation clubs starting Thursday.\n\nZak Rivera, owner of Focused Results Personal Training, addressed the board before the vote. He explained the basis of his fitness business was one-on-one training and there was never more than eight people present at one time. Amid concerns over the coronavirus, he said about half of the sessions conducted by personal trainers at his facility have been conducted online and virtual.\n\n\n\n\"We've been diligent and we understand the severity of the issue, and we're just trying to operate our business as any small business owner would like to do, and also take care of our clients,\" Rivera said, asking the village president to allow him to stay open and offering to adhere to additional hygienic restrictions.\n\n\"We're trying to have our clients be safe as well as our trainers, but as our trainers \u2014 and obviously myself and my wife who own the space \u2014 are reliant on our doors to be open, or at least to be able to do virtual sessions,\" he said. \"In order to pay the trainers, for them to make a living, for us to make a living, it's pretty much imperative that we have that ability to be able to operate our business to some degree.\"\n\nO'Hara said she truly appreciated Rivera's concerns. Later in the meeting, a trustee asked the village president if an exception could be made for local small businesses to conduct one-on-one training.\n\n\"I am certainly not thrilled about having to do this declaration. But I am closing them all, and that is under my authority to do so,\" O'Hara said.\n\n\n\nDespite the hardship for affected businesses and workers, O'Hara said the public's health and safety were the paramount concerns of village leaders.\n\n\"I truly believe that at this point in time we have to do this,\" O'Hara said. \"I am hoping that it will not be for a long duration, and I truly understand how this will affect a lot of local businesses and everything else \u2014 both locally and nationally.\"\n\nThe declaration also authorized emergency purchasing and staffing measures for village employees in the police and public works departments, as needed, to protect health and safety.\n\nThe amendment to the village code and emergency declaration is essentially identical to similar such ordinances incorporated by other suburban municipal clients of Elrod Friedman, recently co-founded by Lake Bluff's village attorney. The changes define civil emergencies and extraordinary emergency authorities.\n\n\n\nThe Illinois Municipal Code grants local governments the power to declare their own states of emergency, and the firm encouraged all its municipal clients to update their codes to include the authority, according to co-founder Steve Elrod.\n\nThe order to close gyms in Lake Bluff follows the closures of Lake Bluff village, park district and library facilities to the public.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker issued a disaster declaration on March 9 and subsequent emergency orders that mandated the statewide closure of all public and private schools, a ban on gatherings of 50 or more people and a restriction on dine-in service at bars and restaurants.\n\nIn Highland Park, Mayor Nancy Rotering ordered all health clubs, movie theaters and live performance venues closed by the end of the day Tuesday after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend.\n\nLake Forest has closed all city playgrounds and all non-essential municipal buildings, and fire department officials have asked residents to limit calls to 911 to true medical emergencies, according to an announcement from city staff. Emergency personnel and public health officials requested that those experiencing only mild symptoms stay home and try to avoid infecting others.\n\nDr. Sana Ahmed, medical epidemiologist at the Lake County Health Department, asked those showing mild COVID-19 symptoms \u2014 fever, coughing, shortness of breath \u2014 to distance themselves from others in their household and using a separate bedroom and bathroom when possible. Call a doctor if the symptoms worsen.\n\n\"We are prioritizing testing for symptomatic people who have high risk of complications \u2014 older adults living in congregate settings and those with chronic health conditions like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, and those with weakened immune systems,\" Ahmed said in a release.\n\nThe moves are an effort to maximize social distancing practices, reduce the rate the coronavirus spreads in the general population and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, a public health intervention often referred to as \"flattening the curve.\"\n\nO'Hara was joined behind the dais by Village Administrator Drew Irvin and Village Attorney Peter Friedman at Wednesday afternoon's emergency meeting. They maintained a distance of at least six feet, as recommended by public health officials, to minimize the risks of transmitting the virus to one another.\n\n\n\n\"The most important message is that our residents need to stay home,\" O'Hara said in a release announcing the emergency declaration.\n\nTrustees were able to vote over the phone thanks to an executive order by the governor. The next Lake Bluff Village Board meeting is tentatively set for April 13.\n\n","category":"state_of_emergency","population":703019.0}

According to the MCDH, the teen has no history of traveling to an affected area and isn't connected to anyone with a known case of COVID-19.\n\nThe teen is in isolation and doing well, health officials said, adding that they are identifying and investigating all who've been in contact with him.\n\nRelated: Coronavirus In Illinois: What You Need To Know For March 11\n\nAccording to the government news release, Franks made the declaration upon the joint recommendation of county public health administrator Melissa Adamson and EMA director David Christensen.\n\n\n\n\"Declaring a state of emergency is not a decision to be made lightly,\" Franks said, in the news release. \"However, with a McHenry County resident now presumptively diagnosed with coronavirus, I have the responsibility to ensure that we can bring all available local, state and federal resources to bear to blunt the impact and bring this to as quick of a conclusion as possible.\"\n\nMarengo added that the declaration shouldn't cause panic or alarm and emphasized Gov. J.B. Pritzker's call for levelheadedness and calm while \"staying abreast of new developments and taking common-sense precautions.\"\n\nAs for the county's first case, Adamson said they don't have much information currently, but are taking all necessary precautions with the case.\n\n\"We encourage all residents to continue using preventative measures to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19 and to begin planning for events that could disrupt their lives, such as school closures or if they become ill,\" Adamson said in the news release.\n\n\n\nMore:\n\nCounty health officials said they will continue to partner with state and regional health departments to monitor all possible new cases as this situation continues to evolve. Residents should continue to use precautions (see below) in their daily routine to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, and they should begin developing a plan should they become ill.\n\nQuick tips for:\n\nEveryone: Use the same daily health precautions you would for flu including washing your hands frequently, for a minimum of 20 seconds, using soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering your cough and sneeze, and staying home when sick.\n\nHealth care: Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of respiratory illness such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing; wear proper personal protective gear such as gowns and masks when needed, and have employees stay home when sick.\n\nDay cares, schools, universities: Review emergency plans, absenteeism policies, and cleaning procedures; identify strategies for alternative learning mechanisms such as on-line programs; and consider postponing or cancelling student exchange programs.\n\nBusinesses: Review emergency and continuity of operation plans, revisit sick leave policies, and assess schedule flexibility.\n\nCommunity and faith organizations: Review emergency plans and communicate with community members if events and services are changed, postponed, or cancelled.Get the latest\n\nMore information and updates via mcdh.info or call the IDPH hotline at 1-800-889-3931.\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't miss updates about precautions in the Crystal Lake and McHenry County area as they are announced.

Like the McHenry County teen, the Kane County woman has no history of recent travel or contact with any other coronavirus patients, and does not work in healthcare, Pritzker said.\n\n\n\nAs another eight cases brought Illinois' coronavirus case count to 19, Illinois officials say there is growing evidence of community transmission \u2014 in other words, coronavirus spreading among those who haven't traveled to high-risk areas but contracted it at home.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, The City of Crystal Lake said they're actively monitoring the activities associated with the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\n\n\"The McHenry County Department of Health (MCDH) is the lead agency for infectious disease in McHenry County and the City is coordinating its efforts with their guidance along with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and IL Dept. of Public Health (IDPH),\" the City wrote in a Facebook post. \"The City has been monitoring the situation and has been in contact with MCDH, IDPH, State of Illinois, and federal agencies, to be informed of the most recent information available.\"\n\n\n\nThe City also provided a list of local, national and worldwide health sources for residents to gather information from.\n\n\"The City has operational plans in place to ensure the delivery of essential City services should an outbreak occur in our community.\"\n\nCoronavirus Could Affect St. Patrick's Day Events, Voting\n\nAlso on Tuesday, officials in McHenry County announced the relocation of polling places from Valley Hi Nursing Home and three other senior care facilities as a precaution to protect their residents from coronavirus.\n\nAccording to the news release from McHenry County, officials decided to \"act proactively to move polling places for the Tuesday, March 17 primary from the county-owned Valley Hi and the three private facilities to alternate locations\" even while they believe the risk to the County remains low.\n\n\"It's out of an abundance of caution for a high-risk population, and following the recommendations of the IDPH and the CDC, Valley Hi requested that the polling location be moved at this time,\" Valley Hi Administrator Tom Annarella said, in the news release.\n\n\n\nPolling places will be relocated as follows:","category":"state_of_emergency","population":307409.0}

Three council members say they\u2019ve been in contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19 and are in self-quarantine.\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has continued to urge people to stay at home as much as possible, instituting bans on gatherings of more than 50 people and closing most restaurants and bars.\n\nHe also signed new rules this week that relax restrictions around electronic participation in public meetings, which make it easier for city councils or county boards to meet virtually.","category":"disaster_declaration","population":199145.0}

It increases the purchasing authority for costs related to the emergency to $100,000, with three informal estimates required.\n\n[ This story is being provided for free to our readers during the new coronavirus outbreak.

He suggested that department heads continue to come into the office on Fridays, saying that was what he intends to do.\n\nFor days when the courthouse is open, the possibility of rotating employees \u2014 having them work on alternate days \u2014 was discussed as an option for ensuring employees are treated fairly.\n\nThe consensus of the meeting was that county employees who are told not to report to work will be paid.\n\n\"The overriding public policy is as follows: Have less people here, but don't punish them economically,\" said Judge Shane Leuthold of Crawford County Municipal Court.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary situation, right?\" Sean Leuthold said. \"We're not going to be able to make sure every little tiny thing is going to be fair and equitable for every single person.

However, since some council business will likely be required in that time frame, the mayor still has the authority to call a meeting when necessary.\n\nDecatur Fire Chief Nate Mara, who is identified in the declaration as the city\u2019s emergency management coordinator, said people need to understand the severity of the situation.\n\n\u201cWe still run across people who are not taking this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cTo help keep our health system floating, people need to be taking it seriously.\u201d\n\nHe said that while as of 5 p.m. Monday, Wise County did not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19, it\u2019s important to do whatever we can to slow down the number of cases to flatten the curve so that the health care system does not become overwhelmed.\n\nDecatur Police Captain Delvon Campbell said it is just a matter of time before Wise County has confirmed cases.\n\n\u201cI would be extremely surprised if this county does not have reports of it coming up soon, because I agree people are not taking it as serious as what they should be. Parking lots at places are still full.

The cities also shut down any indoor or outdoor gatherings of 10 people or more, and warned residents to use the six-foot rule and maintain social distance.\n\nIn the letter, law enforcement officials say exceptions to the proposed curfew would be public safety, healthcare and utility workers, grocery store and restaurant workers, and those in a \u201ccritical infrastructure industry\u201d as defined by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nPeople would be allowed on the road between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. only to seek medical attention, visit grocery stores, restaurants and pharmacies, or deliver items from those businesses.\n\nGilich said Biloxi is \u201casking people to limit travel to what is totally necessary, but there is no total lockdown of this city.\n\n\u201cIf such a decision was made, including time, place and scope, it will be made by the mayor and City Council, with, I hope, all leaders across the Coast working in concert.\u201d\n\nThe mayor told residents that limiting the spread of COVID-19 requires measures similar those taken for a hurricane \u2014 like states of emergency, emergency declarations, and curfews.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the best analogy for the public to remember,\u201d Gilich said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to be alarmed, or to overreact or underreact.

City staff also is meeting with community groups, such as the local interfaith council, to coordinate responses for higher-risk populations, Chi said.\n\n\u201cWe kind of do what we\u2019re doing here, so it\u2019s not so much worried about us getting the flu or me getting the flu, it\u2019s me transmitting it to somebody else who may not have the wherewithal to combat it,\u201d Councilman Mike Posey said.\n\nSupport our coverage by becoming a digital subscriber.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":36791.0}

He has, however, ordered restaurants only to serve food by takeout and ordered the closing of gyms.\n\n\"This is incredibly serious to this state, it's incredibly serious to the lives of Tennesseans,\" Lee said Monday. \"Every single Tennessean should wake up and take personal responsibility for saving the lives of the people around them and for saving the livelihood of their neighbors.\"\n\nAlexis Clark can be reached at aclark@gannett.com.\n\nNote: All of The Leaf-Chronicle's coverage of the coronavirus is being provided free to our readers.

(Photo: Jason Truitt\/Palladium-Item)\n\nRICHMOND, Ind. \u2014 The message was repeated over and over again Friday by city, county and health officials: a surge of sick patients is going to hit our local health care system. Whether that surge arrives as a manageable wave or a disastrous tsunami depends on how cooperative citizens are in complying with new restrictions being put in place.\n\nRichmond and Wayne County officials spent the day Friday debating how far to go with new directives aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19.\n\n\"From 7:30 on until 5:30 today, we've been discussing Wayne County and the health of all the folks in Wayne County and how we keep the people in Wayne County safe,\" County Commissioner Ken Paust said. \"We've worked all day through this with all the parties ... to get to where we are this evening.\"\n\nThey ultimately decided on an order that calls for citizens to cease \"all non-essential interaction\" and asks that employers reduce the number of people who normally would work in their buildings by 30 percent through remote or in-home work, among other measures.\n\n\u25baSUPPORT LOCAL COVERAGE OF CORONAVIRUS DEVELOPMENTS: The paywall on this story has been lifted in the interest of public safety and community knowledge. We ask you consider supporting local journalism with a subscription so we can continue our important work.\n\nThe joint executive order signed by the Wayne County commissioners \u2014 Paust, Mary Anne Butters and Denny Burns \u2014 and Richmond Mayor Dave Snow says:\n\nAll non-essential interaction such as social gatherings and the like should be eliminated;\n\nEmployers should move at least 30 percent of their normal in-building workforce to in-home or remote work;\n\nEmployers should permit those who are most at-risk for severe illness from the virus, including those of advanced age and\/or who have underlying medical conditions, to self-quarantine; and\n\nBusinesses should increase social distancing among their workers and customers.\n\nThe order also says the mayor and commissioners will consult with the police and sheriff's departments about stepping up enforcement of the already-in-place Level 2 travel advisory, which limits citizens to essential travel only.\n\n\"What we're asking our enforcement division to do is to be available out there,\" Paust said. \"If you see excess people or if you see the same person just kind of joy-riding around town to stop that individual not to arrest that individual but say, 'Hey, we've got your name. We've got your license plate. We want you to go home.'\"\n\nShould developments surrounding the outbreak worsen, the order says \"additional, more restrictive directives may be forthcoming.\"\n\n\"These will be in place until our health care professionals advise us otherwise, but public cooperation plays the number one role on when we get that advisement,\" Snow said.\n\nThe county health department also has asked funeral homes not to hold visitation and funeral services, eliminating one more type of event that might bring large groups of people together.\n\n\"I know that sounds shocking not having funerals,\" said Dr. David Jetmore, the county's public health officer. \"People will be interred, but there will not be a gathering of mourners there. We'll have to more than likely have the memorial service when this passes.\"\n\nThe new restrictions come on the heels of Thursday's order from the health department shutting down tattoo parlors, salons, barber shops and more, businesses that feature close person-to-person interaction.\n\nFor days now, officials have been preaching the need for people to stay at home if at all possible, and there are signs that the lesson might be starting to sink in.\n\n\"Folks are beginning to listen to us, but they've got to listen even more,\" Paust said.\n\nOfficials stopped short of upping the travel advisory to a Level 3, which would prohibit all but emergency traffic. They also are loath to issue a \"shelter in place\" order.\n\n\"That would be the last thing that we want to do,\" Paust said.\n\n\"We don't want to close factories down. We don't close some of those mom-and-pop stores that are out there. But you have to help us all the way through.\"\n\nThe steps being taken have one goal: to slow the spread of the virus, limiting the number of people who will get sick at the same time and preventing the health care system from being overwhelmed by a deluge of patients.\n\n\"We have enough for our needs right now in terms of protective supplies for our staff, but ... if we have a much larger number of patients than we have right now, then the rate of the use of those supplies is going to go way up and we will exhaust the supplies very quickly,\" said Dr. Thomas Huth, Reid Health's vice president of medical affairs.\n\nLike a retreating shoreline can portend the coming of a tsunami, there are warning signs that a surge is fast approaching here.\n\n\"This week particularly we've seen a continuous ramp-up in focused activity to doctor's offices, to urgent care, to our emergency room with complaints of respiratory illness,\" Huth said. \"How much of this is COVID is not clear to us. There are certainly other viruses in the community, but I will say that it's a little bit unusual for this late in the winter season to see so much of the respiratory illness. We should be ramping down by now, and we're not doing that.\"\n\nMaking it harder to get a clear understanding on the current situation is the lack of available testing kits. Reid Health has 100 on hand, and so care must be taken in how those resources are used.\n\n\"We have to conserve those for the highest-risk patients where we need to know to make decisions in their care and then also to prioritize to make sure that we keep our health care workers healthy and on the job,\" Huth said.\n\nThere also are problems at the state level with testing, according to Huth. The Indiana State Department of Health's ability to process the tests is limited, so it rations the testing at the local level.\n\n\"We frequently have situations where we're uncertain about whether a patient could have COVID and we ask the state for a test and that is denied because it doesn't meet their criteria,\" he said.\n\nAnd then there's the uncertainty in the results from the tests themselves.\n\n\"The sensitivity on these has been reduced,\" Reid Health CEO\/President Craig Kinyon said. \"If you're positive, you're probably positive. If you're negative, you may be negative.\"\n\nAs of 5 p.m. Friday, Reid had tested 35 patients, with three coming back presumptive positive, nine negative and the other 23 pending.\n\nA presumptive positive means the initial test by the state department of health is positive. The test then is sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.\n\nThere was hope that a needed boost to the cache of local protective equipment was coming Friday from the federal government, but what actually was received was a disappointment.\n\n\"We were notified earlier this morning that the Strategic National Stockpile had been released to Wayne County, so we staged to pick it up with a forklift ... and we had enough to fit in the cab of a truck,\" said Christine Stinson, the executive director of the county health department.\n\nOfficials repeatedly pleaded for the public to heed the restrictions now in place at the state and local levels, emphasizing the importance that cooperation will have on how successfully the coming tide can be stemmed.\n\n\"We're not prepared for the magnitude that we're seeing overseas for critically-ill patients, so the declaration is geared toward slowing down the interactions, reducing the exposures,\" Kinyon said.\n\n\"These aren't things that we're doing lightly. They are actions that are really geared toward the protection against spreading a disease that's very unknown and we have no real tools to combat it.\"\n\nHuth pointed to people's sense of the greater good, a collective call to make sacrifices so as to protect those most vulnerable in the community.\n\n\"We all have a responsibility to each other to take care of ourselves, be responsible for ourselves and be accountable for our own actions so that we don't accidentally hurt other people,\" he said.\n\nAlthough it's hard to know when the outbreak will have abated, Jetmore said such a time is indeed in our future.\n\n\"There will come a day when you will not read or hear about coronavirus except in a historical context,\" he said, \"so hang in there, fellow citizens.\"\n\nJason Truitt is the team leader and senior reporter at the Palladium-Item.

Mellick discussed the annual fee associated with the GoToMeeting video conferencing service necessary for arraignments and attorney communications at the Public Safety Center jail. The Supervisors approved the ongoing use of the County credit card to pay for the annual video conferencing fee.\n\nThe Fiscal-Year 2019 First Judicial District Department of Correctional Services Financial Report was accepted and placed on file.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors adjourned and reconvened as the Board of Canvassers to address the next matter relating to the canvass of the MFL\/MarMac School District special election. Allamakee County Auditor Denise Beyer provided an overview of the special election results indicating that the bond measure did not pass with 60% voter approval being required, which was not met. Beyer provided an overview of the Allamakee County portion of the election results, reporting there were 33 votes received for the bond measure and 41 against within the total of 74 votes cast. The Board of Canvassers accepted the results of the special election and adjourned, with the Board of Supervisors then reconvening.\n\nBeyer discussed the next agenda item relating to a County Auditor\u2019s Office personnel matter. Beyer indicated that Accounting Clerk Karmen Piggott\u2019s six-month probationary period has ended as of March 3 and provided a recommendation to increase Piggott\u2019s current wage of $17.25 per hour to $18 per hour. The Supervisors approved Piggott\u2019s salary increase as of March 3.\n\nAllamakee County Engineer Brian Ridenour provided an overview of the Embargo Road Resolution agenda item, indicating that a majority of asphalt roads are being requested for embargo to include five-ton single axle and seven-ton tandem axle. Ridenour indicated that warmer temperatures and moisture saturation of the sub-base due to frost melt make the embargo necessary and that he has coordinated with Winneshiek County to set the road embargo for the same week. The Embargo Road Resolution was approved.\n\nRidenour discussed setting a date for a public hearing for vacating a portion of old County Road No. 527, indicating that this road is not Power Plant Drive but rather a dead end, 800-foot extension of that road. Ridenour provided a recommendation to set April 6 at 10 a.m. for the public hearing on this matter, which was approved by the Supervisors. Byrnes further clarified that this is a Class C road on private property.\n\nThe Supervisors moved into the consideration of a Cooperative Agreement for a Competitive Highway Bridge Program (CHBP) Project with Bremer County. Ridenour discussed that this is a new Federal program providing aid and allowing a county to bundle bid letting with another county. Ridenour indicated that this competitive highway bridge program funding is made possible through the Division L of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which appropriated $225,000,000 to be awarded by the United States Department of Transportation for a competitive highway bridge program for replacement or rehab of bridges. Ridenour advised that one bridge in Allamakee County qualified for this program and is located on B25 (Lansing Harpers Road) over Cota Creek. The Supervisors approved to enter into a cooperative agreement with Bremer County.\n\nRidenour explained that Federal agreements are coordinated through the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) and that the bridge project on B25 (Lansing Harpers Road) over Cota Creek has a preliminary estimated cost of $700,000 with approximately $382,000 (55%) of that cost being paid by federal aid. The Supervisors approved the Federal aid agreement.\n\nJane Regan with Upper Iowa Insurance Services provided an overview of Allamakee County\u2019s insurance coverage relating to the County Courthouse and Public Safety Center. Regan discussed specific coverage areas including inland marine, business auto, workers\u2019 compensation and liability coverage. Regan provided an overview of the County\u2019s annual premium and advised that the County has adequate and appropriate coverage limits.\n\nUnder Department Head Updates, Ridenour indicated that the Secondary Roads Department is busy with brush cutting, with two motorgraders also out grading roads to repair rough spots. Ridenour also reported that applications are being received for two vacancies in his department until March 12.\n\nRidenour provided an update on the Health Insurance Committee\u2019s recent meeting with a five percent increase to health insurance premiums being likely. He said a recommendation will be made at the next Supervisors meeting.\n\nAllamakee County Environmental Health Director Laurie Moody discussed that she has viewed new building sites, building expansions and well sites and provided an update on upcoming absences due to training sessions.\n\nAllamakee County Emergency Management Coordinator Corey Snitker discussed planning and preparedness relating to the coronavirus. Snitker indicated that a two-day hazardous material operations course is scheduled for this weekend in Waterville, allowing firefighters to attain a hazardous material response certification. Snitker discussed the flood forecast for this year and that a flood meeting is scheduled in Scott County.\n\nBeyer discussed the MFL\/MarMac special election and that the budget public hearing notice is being published in this week\u2019s newspaper (see Page 2B). Beyer discussed being proactive and planning for scenarios relating to staffing and the coronavirus with a virtual private network (VPN) being an option she will be looking into to allow quarantined employees to work from home.\n\nPrior to adjournment, Koenig discussed that County Social Services (CSS) views a proposed one-percent sales tax increase as an opportunity to decrease the use of property tax dollars and provide funding for mental health. Koenig advised that state representatives should be contacted in support of this measure.\n\n","category":"None","population":24624.0}

That is equal to roughly 31% of the nation's population.\n\nIn addition to Delaware, Louisiana and Ohio, similar policies are either in place or will soon take effect in California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.\n\nThe United States now has the third-largest number of confirmed cases, behind China and Italy, respectively.

Both measures will be in effect until at least April 1, according to a news release from Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health.\n\n\u201cIt is incredibly important during this time for people to limit their gatherings to less than 10 people as we try to flatten the curve of the spread of this virus and for people to avoid non-essential community engagement and non-essential trips out of their homes,\u201d Marcellino said in the release.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. Wednesday, Douglas County had one confirmed case of COVID-19, though health officials around the country expect numbers to increase in the coming days.\n\nRestaurants will still be permitted to provide drive-thru, pickup and delivery services. These are the same restaurant restrictions that health officers in Johnson and Wyandotte counties enacted earlier this week.\n\n\u201cWe want to limit environments where people have a greater chance of congregating in a crowd of more than 10 people,\u201d Marcellino said. \u201cWe appreciate the work and cooperation of all business owners as we seek to work together to limit the spread of the virus and especially protect those who might be most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nThe order to prohibit gatherings larger than 10 people relates to both indoor and outdoor gatherings. It does not restrict governmental and judicial functions, health care facilities, private business operations, religious and faith-based activities, weddings and funerals.\n\nMany Lawrence restaurants had already shut down their dine-in services before Wednesday\u2019s order.\n\nOn Tuesday around mid-day, 41 downtown restaurants and businesses on Massachusetts Street in Lawrence had signs up announcing they were either closing or restricting service to takeout and delivery because of the outbreak. Other restaurants, however, remained open.\n\nThe City of Lawrence and Douglas County, the local courts and other exempted organizations, including many churches, had also already moved to limit or ban gatherings in their buildings.\n\nOn Tuesday, the county health department had ordered an eight-week halt to gatherings of 50 people or more, and it \u201cstrongly\u201d recommended against gatherings with more than 10 people for the same period. By Wednesday afternoon, \u201cknown community transmission\u201d had been identified to the east in Johnson County, which had at least 11 confirmed cases, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The state as as whole had 21 confirmed cases as of 2:30 p.m., although KDHE said that testing would begin to be limited to only the most serious cases in Johnson County, given the widespread nature of the virus there and the potential strain on laboratories and hospital resources.\n\nPatients in Douglas County who have symptoms \u2014 difficulty breathing, cough and fever \u2014 and are seeking medical attention should call their health care provider first before showing up at any medical offices. Patients without a health care provider may call the Lawrence Douglas-County health department\u2019s coronavirus line, 785-856-4343.\n\nMore coverage: Coronavirus (COVID-19) As the pandemic continues, the Journal-World will be making coverage of COVID-19 available outside of the paywall on LJWorld.com.

At a special meeting called March 17, 2020, Osage County commissioners also took action to limit access to the courthouse and conduct a health screening of all who enter, including employees.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced the state\u2019s efforts against the virus will include the closure of the state\u2019s school buildings for the remainder of the school year and ordered that group gatherings across the state be limited to no more than 50 people in a single area.\n\nOsage County\u2019s emergency declaration followed the state\u2019s declaration of March 12, and once enacted it authorizes the activation of the county\u2019s local emergency response plan.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s special commission meeting, with most of the county department heads in attendance, Osage County Health Department Director Jackie Patterson, who is also the county\u2019s health officer, outlined then current statistics on coronavirus cases in the U.S. By March 18 the total had risen to 7,038 total cases in the U.S. with 97 deaths; and in Kansas, 21 positive test results and one death.\n\nPatterson reported Tuesday there was one person under investigation from Osage County.\n\n\u201cThis is a person who has been identified as someone who qualifies to be tested,\u201d Patterson told the commissioners. \u201cAs of this morning, we still don\u2019t have the results back.\u201d\n\nShe explained that although testing for the virus was now underway in the U.S., it could take several days to get results back.\n\nPatterson said the Osage County resident and her family are under a 14-day quarantine. She said the reason the person was tested was because they had traveled.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any local spread yet,\u201d Patterson said, noting no known positive cases in Osage County at that time.\n\nCommissioners considered the feasibility of closing the courthouse temporarily or limiting access, and all nodded in agreement with Patterson that the courthouse should stay open for public business as long as it was possible.\n\n\u201cWe still have to run our county and we still have people that need services, and we still have people that need things,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nAfter discussion about how to limit access, commissioners decided entry to the courthouse would only be through the west entrance and it would be monitored by a sheriff\u2019s deputy.\n\n\u201cThey would possibly do a quick health screen like take your temperature and just make sure we don\u2019t have somebody coming in that\u2019s noticeably sick,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cMight ask them a couple of questions, have you been to \u2013 have a specific list of places that might be hot beds right now.\u201d\n\nOsage County Commissioner Ken Kuykendall asked Sheriff Laurie Dunn if she had officers available to man the courthouse door.\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cWe will get it done, if that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it was a good idea last week,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cI shut my buildings down last week, just for those purposes, the number of people coming into my buildings, I have small lobbies.\u201d\n\nBuildings under Dunn\u2019s responsibility include the jail and sheriff\u2019s office. She later told Osage County News that the front door of the sheriff\u2019s office is now locked and any visitors will need to ring a doorbell and wait for an officer to let them in.\n\n\u201cThere comes a point when I have to protect my employees,\u201d Dunn said.\n\nRegarding the courthouse screening, Dunn said, \u201cEverybody is going to have to go through it. Every time you go smoke, you\u2019re going to have to take the long trip, and I know that upsets courthouse employees.\u201d\n\nBy Tuesday afternoon, commissioners had implemented the screening process for courthouse visitors, with two deputies stationed a few feet inside the west courthouse door armed with an oral and forehead thermometer and a jug of hand sanitizer.\n\nKuykendall also questioned Patterson about guidelines for local restaurants and churches.\n\nPatterson said she was recommending everyone follow the national guideline of congregating in groups of less than 10 people.\n\nConcerning restaurants, \u201cRight now we\u2019re not going to close them down,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cMost of our restaurants are pretty small. Most of times they don\u2019t have 10 people except during rush hour. Most times they don\u2019t have 10 people within close proximity with each other.\n\n\u201cAs long as we can prevent any of that (groups of more than 10), I will let them monitor themselves,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cRight now we don\u2019t have a positive case, as soon as we do that, we will reevaluate,\u201d Patterson said.\n\nShe offered the same recommendation for churches \u2013 meet in groups less than 10 people only.\n\nPatterson said she expected her office to be hectic soon and asked if Osage County Clerk Rhonda Beets could assist her as a public information officer during the health emergency.

Consider avoiding social gatherings. If you have a fever, cough, shortness of breath or other medical issues that can be addressed over the phone, contact your healthcare provider before going to the office or emergency room.\n\nInside events that have over 10 attendees should be cancelled.\n\nTake these common steps to avoid contracting COVID-19, Influenza A and B, and the seasonal cold.\n\nWash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nAvoid touching your face and cover your face when coughing or sneezing.\n\nRefrain from personal contact with other people.\n\nSocially distance yourself from large gatherings of people.\n\nUtilize disinfectant products on common surfaces if you have to be out (such as a grocery cart).\n\nUtilize hand sanitizers when hand washing is unavailable.\n\nWednesday morning, county commissioners agreed to hold special meetings at 8:30 a.m. daily Monday to Saturday, until further notice.\n\nOsage County\u2019s COVID-19 Facebook page: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Osage-County-Covid-19-110249017270887\/\n\nKDHE COVID-19 information:\n\nhttps:\/\/govstatus.egov.com\/coronavirus\n\nCDC COVID-19 information\n\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/","category":"state_of_emergency","population":16142.0}

{"state":"Kansas","county":"Sedgwick","publish_date":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.kansas.com\/news\/politics-government\/article241433771.html","title":"Sedgwick County, KS recommends stay-at-home order","text":"Sedgwick County has become the latest in Kansas to order an array of businesses to shut down and most workers to stay home in the ongoing battle against the coronavirus and COVID-19, pending a decision from the county\u2019s local health officer.\n\nIn a special meeting late Monday afternoon, the County Commission, acting as the Board of Health, recommended a widespread closure of business in and around Wichita for a period of 30 days starting March 25. To take effect, the local health officer Garold Minns would need to sign off on the order.\n\nCommissioner Lacey Cruse said the order is necessary, in part, because the county doesn\u2019t have a good handle on how the disease is spreading locally because testing is severely limited.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t have an economy if we don\u2019t have people. And I think that it\u2019s important to understand that people are our most valuable resources,\u201d Cruse said.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nThe ordinance is nearly identical to the stay-at-home orders issued earlier in Kansas City suburbs and exurbs including Johnson, Wyandotte, Douglas and Leavenworth counties. On Monday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced an executive order banning gatherings of more than 10 people across the state.\n\nSo far, the coronavirus has been more prevalent in those areas than in south-central Kansas. But officials acknowledge that due to supply shortages, they\u2019ve been unable to test sufficiently to establish the extent of COVID-19 in the Wichita area.\n\nThe disease has now entered a phase of community spread, meaning that residents appear to be catching it from each other, in contrast to the earliest local cases that were caused by exposure on a cruise ship vacation or imported directly from other states where the disease has been more widespread.\n\nAs of 2:30 p.m. Monday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported 82 cases of COVID-19 including two deaths.\n\nThe cases are spread across 16 of the state\u2019s 105 counties, led by Johnson County, 32 cases, and Wyandotte County, 16 cases. Sedgwick County had three positive tests as of Monday, according to County Manager Tom Stolz.\n\nLocal hospital leaders told county commissioners on Monday that there could be as many as 1,000 cases in the Wichita area, Commission Chair Pete Meitzner said.\n\n\u201cThey believe that the virus is alive in our community,\u201d Meitzner said of Wesley Healthcare and Ascension Via Christi, Wichita\u2019s largest hospital systems.\n\nLocal law enforcement will be empowered to enforce the order, but no penalty \u2014 civil or criminal \u2014 has been set.\n\nSome enforcement decisions will rest with local authorities, depending on their city municipal codes, Stolz said.\n\nHe said he\u2019s been in contact with Sheriff Jeff Easter and Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay and they both indicated they don\u2019t have the personnel resources or desire to run harsh crackdowns enforcing the order.\n\nStolz assured the commission that the sheriff\u2019s deputies will not be actively pulling people over to check whether they\u2019re supposed to be out and about.\n\nThe commission acted after the Sedgwick County Medical Society, representing 1,250 physicians, sent a letter calling for a \u201cshelter-in-place order that would be reassessed in two weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough Sedgwick County is fortunate to have only a few confirmed cases of COVID-19 thus far, that is unlikely to last long,\u201d said the letter, signed by society board president Patricia Wyatt-Harris. \u201cBecause a surge of new cases could quickly overwhelm our hospital systems and put citizens\u2019 lives at risk, it is critical to take action now to decrease local spread.\u201d\n\nThe Sedgwick County ordinance includes a list of exemptions for critical governmental functions, services and industries.\n\nHealth care and public safety top the list of exemptions, with carve-outs for health workers, police, firefighters, paramedics and other emergency responders.\n\nPeople will still be allowed to walk their dogs and take part in other outdoors activities as long as they observe social distancing, which means keeping a 6-foot buffer between people. Parks will remain open, but school playgrounds will not. Fishing and other food-gathering activities are also allowed.\n\nRestaurants will be allowed to provide products on a pick-up or delivery basis only, to discourage crowds from gathering for nonessential activity. Most entertainment venues and other leisure activities are already shut down.\n\nPeople will also be allowed to go to the grocery store or deliver provisions to family or friends. Child care facilities would be open but limited to ten people at a time in a confined space. Commissioner Michael O\u2019Donnell said the county will need to get further guidance from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment on the rules for child care.\n\nBusinesses in the food-supply chain, including grocery stores, dollar stores, gas stations and mini-marts will be allowed to remain open, along with auto shops, businesses that sell pet supplies and other businesses deemed necessary for the safe functioning of society.\n\nPlumbers, electricians, painters and construction workers are exempt, as are many professionals such as lawyers and accountants. Many area professionals have already taken steps for them and their employees to work remotely from home as much as possible.\n\nAerospace and other manufacturing plants will continue to operate those assembly lines, with workers directed to keep as much separation between themselves and co-workers as possible.\n\nThe county also wrote in an exemption for church-based relief efforts providing food and other supplies to homebound residents. The one added exemption to the ordinance passed in the Kansas City area was adding leaders and employees of religious institutions to the list of people allowed to go to work.\n\nCommissioners took action a day after the county health officer, University of Kansas physician Garold Minns, urged a relatively cautious approach because of the economic damage that could come with a lengthy and widespread closure.\n\nBut Minns, dean of the KU Medical School in Wichita, also cautioned that if a stay-at-home order were to become necessary, it should be comprehensive and not contain so many exemptions that the majority of people could go about their routine business.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s going to get worse. We know that. We just don\u2019t know how long it is going to take,\u201d Commissioner Jim Howell said. He said it\u2019s important to continue monitoring the situation daily to make sure the hospitals don\u2019t get overwhelmed. He said these kinds of measures will likely last three months.\n\nThe recommendation passed 3-2, with Howell and O\u2019Donnell voting against it. Howell said he needed more data, and O\u2019Donnell said he wanted Minns to make the decision on his own.\n\nCommissioner David Dennis echoed concerns about a lack of testing in Sedgwick County.\n\n\u201cWithout testing, we don\u2019t know the extent of the problem here in Sedgwick County and that\u2019s a big problem,\u201d Dennis said.\n\nElisha Yaghmai, a Wichita physician and president of FreeState Healthcare, said a shortage of testing materials across the country severely limits what strategies communities can deploy to fight coronavirus.\n\nWith more test kits, Sedgwick County could take a more targeted approach, Yaghmai said. But the tests aren\u2019t available and it\u2019s unclear when and if those will ever become available.\n\n\u201cUntil we can come up with a better approach from a testing and epidemiology perspective, and since we don\u2019t know when that\u2019s coming, in the short term we may very well need to move to just the stay-at-home scenario to try to protect who we can protect,\u201d Yaghmai said.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":505415.0}

Beshear restricts nursing home visits: What it means for Magoffin Share:\n\n\n\n\n\nSALYERSVILLE \u2013 With eight confirmed cases in the state, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had its first effect on Magoffin County, with the governor issuing an order restricting visitation to nursing homes and long-term care facilities.\n\nSalyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation Center Administrator Josh Calhoun released the following statement on Tuesday, March 10, after Governor Andy Beshear\u2019s order was made public:\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the situation surrounding the COVID-19 virus and following it very closely. Our facility is using the CDC guidelines as direction, and suggest the community do the same. We ask that visitors with any signs or symptoms, been exposed to, recently recovered or have traveled to areas with any type of viral\/bacterial outbreak to refrain from visiting our residents. Visitors will be limited based on the orders set forth by the governor of Kentucky. As with any type of illness, we cannot express enough the importance of proper hand washing and cough etiquette.\u201d\n\nIn a video posted on Facebook, Calhoun went into more detail, stating, \u201cI want to ensure all family members that your loved ones are safe within our care. I\u2019d also like to say as an extra precaution each day our staff will have their temperature taken and a health screen will be performed to keep your family members safe and make sure we don\u2019t let anyone in our facility that may be sick.\u201d\n\nCalhoun reiterated the patients\u2019 needs are their highest concern, noting that family members can still bring items to residents.\n\n\u201cIf there are things you would like to have delivered to your family members, please do so at the Blue Wing awning and we\u2019ll gladly accept those at the door,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cWe can ask that you not enter the facility for the safety of our residents and to the order given to us by the governor of Kentucky.\u201d\n\nCalhoun said if anyone has any questions to call his office at 606-349-6181, Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.\n\nThe order issued by the governor, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and Office of Inspector General stated, \u201cIn addition to the recent recommendations from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, Department for Public Health, pursuant to authority granted in KRS 214.020 and Executive Order 2020-215 hereby issues this supplemental guidance by recommending that long-term care facilities limit visitation only to those loved ones that are receiving end-of-life care.\u201d\n\nThe order further explains that the visitors that are allowed will have to have their temperatures taken at the facility\u2019s front desk and they must be escorted to and from the room they are visiting. Visitors with 100.1 degrees F temperatures will be denied entry and should be advised to seek medical attention if they are showing any other respiratory infection signs or symptoms,\n\nif they have recently traveled internationally to restricted countries or if they have had contact with someone under investigation for COVID-19.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, Governor Beshear held a press conference on the issue, stating that 20 cases had been tested on Tuesday, with 18 negative and 2 positive. At press time, the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Kentucky remains at eight, though Beshear noted that number will rise. Of the eight, five are in Harrison County, two in Fayette and one in Jefferson.\n\nHe said all of the Harrison County individuals can be linked.\n\nBeshear commended Harrison County for their quick actions, canceling schools and distributing small newspapers to all residents with important information about the virus.\n\n\u201cThis just shows being prepared and taking the necessary steps can do so much,\u201d Beshear said.\n\nHe noted that the state of emergency is still in effect, allowing the state access to all the tools and supplies needed to combat the virus.\n\nBeshear also emphasized that if someone is sick and suspects it could be COVID-19, they should call the Coronavirus Hotline at 1-800-722-5725. He urged sick people to stay home unless they require medical attention.\n\nPeople over 60 years old and people with heart, lung or kidney diseases or other chronic illnesses are urged to avoid large crowds, to not fly and to not get on cruise ships, per the Center for Disease Control\u2019s guidelines.\n\nAs for the restrictions on the nursing home and long-term care facilities\u2019 visitation, Beshear said, \u201cThis is about life, health and safety. It\u2019s my job to help prevent what happened in Seattle from happening here.\u201d\n\nHe urged businesses to prepare telework options and paid sick leave that would cover employees from the time of concern, the testing period and the recovery period.\n\nOn Monday, Magoffin County Health Department Director and Salyersville Mayor James \u201cPete\n\nShepherd handed out flyers to local businesses, detailing facts from the CDC regarding COVID-19, including:\n\n- diseases can make anyone sick regardless of race or ethnicity,\n\n- people who have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or been in an area with an ongoing spread are at an increased risk of exposure,\n\n- someone who has completed quarantine or has been released from isolation does not pose a risk of infection to other people,\n\n- know the symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) and seek medical advice if you develop symptoms and have been in contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or to an area with an ongoing spread of COVID-19,\n\n- wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; stay home when you\u2019re sick; and cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\n","category":"None","population":12950.0}

VANESSA: THE BALTIMORE CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT CHIEF SAID NINE MEMBERS WHO ENCOUNTER TO POSSIBLE CORONAVIR PATIENTS HAVE NOW BEEN CLEARED\n\nAdvertisement Baltimore-area leaders speak on how governor's coronavirus orders will be enforced Share Shares Copy Link Copy\n\nBaltimore-area leaders are sending a message that they are prepared to address concerns connected to the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, joined by major department heads Monday afternoon, addressed questions, concerns and rumors making the rounds.The mayor said he supports Gov. Larry Hogan's order issued Monday to close nonessential businesses.\"This order helps protect our most vulnerable residents by limiting opportunities for the disease to spread,\" Young said.The governor's announcement did not include a shelter-in-place requirement, but city officials are urging residents to remain home as much as possible to help limit contact and slow the transmission of the coronavirus.In the city, a police Social Distancing Task Force is responsible for enforcing governor's directive, and officers will check to make sure businesses are closed and will keep an eye on them.\"Just like with the first executive order, we are now making adjustments to make sure we can enforce the governor's executive orders with the additional closures beginning at 5 p.m. (Monday), and when we get calls of noncompliance where there are gatherings of 10 people or more, we are responding to that and dispersing those individuals and educating those business owners as to what's required with the governor's executive orders. We've had a few calls to disperse gatherings of 10 or more, and we will continue to do that, and we will continue patrols and answering calls to make sure that our Social Distancing Task force will go out and make sure that businesses are in compliance, and when we find that they are not, we will take appropriate action,\" Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said.\"Our approach is to make sure that people recognize the fact that this is a serious matter and that this is the order of the governor. To this point, we've had full compliance, we haven't had any issues, and we've been successful, but at the end of the day, we will make sure that when we have gatherings that get brought to our attention, they will be resolved,\" Baltimore County Police Chief Melissa Hyatt said.The order will not impact essential city services -- police, fire and emergency responders will continue to respond to 911 calls; trash and recycling will still be picked up; and Citizen Drop-Off Centers will remain open, among other services. Additionally, the Emergency Operations Center will remain active to manage the city's response to the virus.Speaking Monday afternoon, Harrison also clarified the purpose of the National Guard in Baltimore.\"I want to take this time to play down any rumors that might be out there: The National Guard is here to support meal distribution, provide aid and planning and transportation and logistical assistance as needed, but the Baltimore Police Department is committed to working around the clock to keep the members of the public and the department informed of where the agency stands with COVID-19 preparations and actions,\" Harrison said.As of Monday morning, Baltimore City has 31 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Maryland Department of Health.There is evidence of community transmission of the coronavirus in Baltimore.Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said the city's response is focused on community mitigation and preparation for potential hospital surge, adding that not everyone requires testing or evaluation by a physician for the onset of mild symptoms.\"The Maryland Department of Health updated some of its policies in order to ensure that those at high risk for COVID-19 will be prioritized for testing,\u201d Dzirasa said.\u201cWe really only want people to call 911 when there is a life-threatening emergency we don't want to over exacerbate the system,\u201d said BCFD Fire Chief Niles Ford.The Baltimore City fire chief said nine city fire personnel in two incidents were taken off-duty temporarily after handling two suspected coronavirus patients. Those patients turned out to be negative for coronavirus, and the personnel returned to duty.Several city agencies have adjusted service hours and operations.Parking Authority of Baltimore -- The Parking Authority of Baltimore remains closed. However, staff are available to assist the public via email at parkingauthority@bcparking.com or by phone at 443-573-2800. No employees will be working from the office until the emergency has been lifted.Parking meters\/parking meter restrictions will not be in effect for this period.No payment is required at parking meters.Baltimore Municipal and Zoning Appeals (BMZA) -- As of Monday, BMZA has suspended all operations.

New appeals and rescheduled hearings will be scheduled and heard on an expedited basis when operations resume.Mayor's Office of Employment Development -- MOED has suspended the operation of its adult and youth service locations due to COVID-19. This impacts a number of the services. Those seeking help with finding employment or other supports are encouraged to visit the MOED's website for links to resources that are available at this time.Department of Transportation -- The Department of Transportation (DOT) will scale back its employee workforce in order to comply with social distancing protocols. On-call crews will be used to perform daily agency operations, which will be significantly reduced. As a result, the following services will be affected:The enforcement of Residential Permit Parking, street cleaning parking, 48-hour parking, abandoned vehicles and peak hour parking violations will be suspended. Transportation Enforcement Officers will focus on citing immediate safety and pedestrian issues.Vehicle towing operations will be significantly reduced and will focus on immediate safety issues.

Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.Prevention and treatmentThere is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.Stay home when you are sick.Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.Follow CDC\u2019s recommendations for using a facemask.CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.For information about handwashing, see CDC\u2019s Handwashing website.For information specific to healthcare, see CDC\u2019s Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings.These are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses. CDC does have specific guidance for travelers.","category":"None","population":823015.0}

The first presumptive positive case in the state was a woman in Norfolk County on March 2.\n\n\"MEMA has been activated and is bringing together health, human service, public safety and several other government agencies,\" said the governor. \"This working group is following the Department of Public Health infectious disease task force that was stood up in January. ... this declaration will give our administration more flexibility to respond to this outbreak.\"\n\nHe said the risks for transmission have increased, noting the Berkshire cases \"that just popped.\"\n\nSudders said the presumptive positive is based on testing from the state Public Health Lab. \"Those specimens will now be sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention for confirmation,\" she said.\n\nOf the 92 reported cases, 70 are related to a Biogen conference held in Boston at the end of February and four are travel related. Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders said 18 are under investigation. Six people are hospitalized, 62 are not and 24 are under investigation; 40 are women and 52 are men.\n\nAnother man from nearby Readsboro, Vt., was hospitalized on Thursday at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington.\n\nCOVID-19 first spread in the vicinity of Wuhan, China, where it has so far killed more than 3,000 deaths out of more than 80,000 cases. There are now more than 800 cases identified in the United States and 28 deaths \u2014 most of those in the state of Washington.\n\nThe symptoms include fever, severe cough and respiratory distress. At least 80 percent of those contracting the disease will recover with the severity of the illness ranging from hospitalization to minor or no symptoms. Those most at risk are individuals age 60 and older or who have underlying medical conditions.\n\nOfficials said the coronavirus is apparently spreading through person-to-person contact now, beyond any direct correlations to travel or the conference.\n\nBecause the outbreak is \"rapidly expanding\" through community transmission, said Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Monica Bharel, \"we are at a critical point in this outbreak ... we will need everybody's cooperation.\"\n\nThe governor applauded the decision by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh on Tuesday to cancel the St. Patrick's Day Parade but said it's too early yet to consider the Boston Marathon that is a month away. He said private enterprises should consider how they will address situations such as sporting events, conferences and large gatherings.\n\nLocal organizations are making decisions on how to prevent the spread of the disease. The town of Clarksburg shut down its public buildings on Sunday to allow them to be cleaned and sanitized after it was learned the first Berkshire County came from that town.\n\nGeneral Dynamics has instituted measures including cleaning and disinfecting work areas and common spaces used by the affected employees, \"who was in the facility for several days out of the last two weeks,\" according to a statement from the company.\n\n\"The Pittsfield facility remains open for business. We are working closely with officials from Berkshire County to keep them apprised of our proactive measures. The health and safety of our employees, our Navy partners, and our community is our top priority,\" said Carlo Zaffanella, vice president and general manager of Maritime and Strategic Systems for General Dynamics Mission Systems.\n\nThe Berkshire Food Project, which feeds dozens of people lunch every week day in North Adams, posted on Facebook that it would be \"sanitizing tables a lot\" and rearranging them to reduce the number of people sitting together in close proximity.\n\n\"We are trying to be overly cautious because we care about everyone who dines with us,\" the post states, adding that \"we will be happy to provide your meal to go if you are concerned about congregating in our dining room for a meal.\"\n\nThe North Adams Public Schools and McCann Technical School were disinfected by fogging devices over the weekend. Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art \"is actively following CDC recommendations,\" according to its website , which includes \"cleaning of touch surfaces, deployment of more hand-disinfectant stations, and encouragement of frequent hand washing, and hygienic 'sneeze and cough' etiquette.\"\n\nThe vast museum may be large enough to allow browsing while still keeping the recommended social distancing of 6 feet to prevent transmission.\n\nBharel said the highly contagious virus can be spread through surfaces, personal contact and through droplets from coughing and sneezing.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":null}

He made the declaration during the Bay County Board of Commissioners meeting held within the gymnasium of the Bay County Community Center at 800 John F. Kennedy Drive in Bay City.\n\nThe declaration comes a few days after the county\u2019s first presumptive positive test for a case of coronavirus, that man being a Bay County resident and physician at Covenant HealthCare in Saginaw.\n\nSuch a declaration lasts seven days, but the board voted to extend it until its next meeting on April 14.\n\n\u201cWe know there are more,\u201d Barcia said. \u201cAdditional people have been tested. We don\u2019t know what the results of those tests are. This will make Bay County eligible for all the resources made available to our municipal government from federal and state governments in Lansing and Washington. All this does is declare what we have \u2014 a state of emergency.\u201d\n\nBarcia said it typically takes eight days for results to come in on the coronavirus tests.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned for everyone\u2019s health and safety during this coronavirus disease pandemic,\u201d Barcia continued. \u201cMuch has changed in just a short period of time. We are going to be taking all necessary steps to help stop the spread of this disease in our community while continuing to provide the services that are needed.\u201d\n\nHe added that as of Tuesday morning, offices within the Bay County Building are closed to the public.\n\n\u201cHowever, services will still be provided to the public as our workers will still be reporting,\u201d Barcia said.\n\nBay County Health Department Director Joel R. Strasz said his agency\u2019s staff have been working with peers in Saginaw and Midland counties as well as with personnel at Covenant HealthCare.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted nearly two dozen individuals associated with this case,\u201d said Strasz, referring to the presumptive positive Bay County case. \u201cIn some cases, some individuals have self-quarantined for the 14-day process.\u201d\n\nHe added about 30 people have been tested, those tests having been submitted to state and private labs.\n\n\u201cAt least seven have come back negative and we\u2019re waiting to hear on the remaining tests,\u201d Strasz said. An estimated 15 people have been admitted to inpatient hospitals with symptoms similar to those of coronavirus, he continued.\n\nThe state can process about 150 tests per day and that is being ramped up, Strasz said.\n\nBoth Barcia and Strasz said that as Bay County has the highest percentage of residents 60 or older, it is imperative for all citizens to do their part in flattening the curve, or stymieing the contagion\u2019s spread.\n\n\u201cWe must protect all Bay County residents, but especially the most vulnerable,\u201d Strasz said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there are 65 people in Michigan who have tested presumptive positive for coronavirus, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nPREVENTION TIPS\n\nMichigan\u2019s State Emergency Operations Center is coordinating state-government resources and the response to the coronavirus spread.

But outside observers and federal health officials have pointed to four primary issues that together hampered the national response \u2014 the early decision not to use the test adopted by the World Health Organization, flaws with the more complex test developed by the CDC, government guidelines restricting who could be tested and delays in engaging the private sector to ramp up testing capacity.\n\nCombined with messaging from the White House minimizing the disease, that fueled a lackluster response that missed chances to slow the spread of the virus, they said.\n\n\u201cThere were many, many opportunities not to end up where we are,\u201d Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard, told the AP. \u201cBasically, they took this as business as usual. ... And that\u2019s because the messaging from the White House was \u2018this is not a big deal, this is no worse than the flu.\u2019 So that message basically created no sense of urgency within the FDA or the CDC to fix it.\u201d\n\nEven as private labs have been cleared by government regulators to process tens of thousands of additional tests in the last two weeks, experts warn that the nation is still falling well short of enough testing capacity to keep ahead of the highly contagious virus. And it can often take a week just to get results back.\n\nTrump last week rated his administration\u2019s response to the crisis as a perfect 10. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the CDC\u2019s system wasn\u2019t designed to test for and track a widespread outbreak, which he characterized as \u201ca failing.\u201d\n\nIn interviews with the AP, two federal health officials with direct knowledge of the situation said CDC experts don\u2019t know why many of the agency\u2019s test kits failed to reliably detect the virus. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about what went wrong.\n\nJ. Stephen Morrison, a health policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, called the testing issues a \u201cdebacle,\u201d contributing to what he described as a confused and delayed federal response to the crisis.\n\nAs a result, he said, the CDC has now been marginalized within the White House \u2014 a worrisome development.\n\n\u201cCDC has generally been regarded as the best in the game,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they anticipated the technical difficulty or the speed with which the virus has been moving. The virus was racing out ahead of them.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFATEFUL DECISIONS\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, Chinese scientists informed the World Health Organization about a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases of unknown cause in the industrial megalopolis of Wuhan that they linked to the city\u2019s wholesale fish market. Less than two weeks later, the Chinese had sequenced the virus\u2019 genetic makeup and shared it with the world.\n\nWithin days, German scientists had developed a test that could identify a unique part of the virus\u2019 DNA. The WHO quickly adopted the German test, publishing technical guidelines on Jan. 17 and working with private companies to produce testing kits.\n\nAs they have done with some past outbreaks, officials at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta decided to develop their own test, focusing on three gene targets distinct from what the WHO used. Over the decades, the headquarters lab had built a track record of being among the first to develop tests for new diseases and quickly making them available for disease tracking.\n\nThe CDC published the technical details for its COVID-19 test on Jan. 28, 10 days after the WHO. By then, the virus had already been in the U.S. for at least two weeks.\n\nThe 35-year-old man who would become the first American to test positive had arrived in Seattle on Jan. 15, following a trip to Wuhan. After swabs from his nose and throat were flown to the CDC lab, federal officials announced the results Jan. 21.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC the following day, the Republican president was asked about the risk to the nation.\n\n\u201cWe have it totally under control,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one person coming in from China. ... It\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\nWith limited capacity at the CDC lab in Atlanta, the agency placed strict criteria on who could be tested: people with fevers, coughing or difficulty breathing who had also visited Wuhan within the preceding two weeks or who had close contact with someone already confirmed or under investigation for having the virus.\n\nOn Jan. 30, the day the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency, Trump again assured the American people that the virus was \u201cvery well under control.\u201d\n\nThen he departed for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he tweeted a photo of himself playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach.\n\n\u201cGetting a little exercise this morning!\u201d the president wrote.\n\nThe following day, the U.S. declared its own emergency. Still, U.S. citizens returning from China who did not have a fever weren\u2019t tested for the virus but were encouraged to self-quarantine at home for 14 days.\n\nAt that point, the CDC had confirmed just eight cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. The agency amended its testing criteria to include people with fevers who had traveled to China, rather than just Wuhan.\n\n___\n\nFLAWED TEST KITS\n\nFour days after the U.S. declared a state of emergency, only 178 patients had been tested and 82 others were listed as \u201cpending,\u201d meaning they were awaiting final results, according to CDC data released at the time.\n\nTo help increase the number of people being screened, the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization for CDC-certified labs run by state health departments to begin processing swabs, and they were provided with kits that could test 250 patients.\n\nAs the first tests were processed at the state labs, technicians reported getting inconclusive results, which the CDC has said could be due to the test looking for signs of generic coronaviruses, of which there are many, rather than the specific virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nWhatever the reason, by mid-February, only about a half-dozen state and local public health labs had reliable tests. But still, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield continued to insist his agency had developed \u201ca very accurate test.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe found that, in some of the states, it didn\u2019t work,\u201d Redfield said earlier this month. \u201cWe figured out why. I don\u2019t consider that a fault. I consider that doing quality control. I consider that success.\u201d\n\nThe testing problems emerged just as the CDC broadened its criteria to include patients who were \u201cseverely ill\u201d with COVID-19 symptoms \u201ceven if a known source of exposure has not been identified.\u201d\n\nAs more sick people sought to be tested, many states were forced to limit access because of the flawed CDC test. Accounts began to emerge through social media of people with all the symptoms of COVID-19 who either couldn\u2019t get tested or had test results delayed by days or even a week.\n\n\u201cI know of doctor friends of mine who have critically ill patients in the ICU, and we don\u2019t know if they have COVID or not because we can\u2019t get a test,\u201d Jha said last week.\n\n___\n\nCOMMUNITY TRANSMISSION\n\nOn Feb. 24, exasperated officials at the Association of Public Health Laboratories sent a letter to the FDA, basically asking permission for state labs to develop their own tests. Within days, the FDA reversed its previous position and said both public and private labs could conduct testing.\n\nTrump continued to insist the virus would die out on its own. \u201cOne day, it\u2019s like a miracle. It will disappear,\u201d he predicted Feb. 27.\n\nBy then, experts say, the opportunity to halt the relentless spread of the virus within the U.S. population had been lost.\n\nOn Feb. 29, only 472 patients had been tested nationwide, with just 22 cases confirmed, according to CDC data. Of those, nine cases were not related to travel but had spread person-to-person within the U.S.\n\nBy comparison, South Korea had its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on Jan. 20, the same day as the U.S. Officials there used a test that focused on the same gene targets as the WHO test, according to the website of a test manufacturer. They then quickly permitted private-sector labs to run the samples. As a result, a nation with less than one-sixth the population of the U.S. mobilized to test more than 20,000 people a day.\n\nSouth Korea also instituted drive-thru centers, allowing quicker identification of those who were infected but might not be displaying symptoms, thus slowing the emergence of new cases to a more manageable level.\n\nMeanwhile, the rate of U.S. infections soared.\n\n\u201cThe system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for,\u201d Fauci conceded during a congressional hearing earlier this month. \u201cThat is a failing. Let\u2019s admit it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nSHIFTING BLAME\n\nAs public outrage over the lack of available U.S. tests grew, the FDA announced it would allow private diagnostic lab companies to produce new tests without preauthorization from regulators.\n\nTrump and HHS Secretary Alex Azar visited the CDC lab in Atlanta on March 6, praising the agency\u2019s performance and promising 4 million test kits would be available by the end of the following week.\n\nThat lofty number didn\u2019t match the ability of U.S. labs to process tests, however. Private providers were just then ramping up, while CDC and state health labs processed about 25,200 COVID-19 tests in the following seven days, according to CDC data.\n\nAt the same news conference, Trump said he wanted infected passengers to remain on a cruise ship off the West Coast to keep the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. low.\n\n\u201cI like the numbers being where they are,\u201d Trump said, shortly before departing Atlanta for another weekend of golf in Florida. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d\n\nTrump has also attempted to mislay blame for the testing troubles on the Obama administration. In 2018, Trump disbanded the White House directorate charged with preparing for and responding to global pandemics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all,\u201d Trump replied when asked about the testing shortfall in a March 13 briefing at the White House.\n\nMorrison said Trump appears to see the virus as a political issue rather than a public health threat.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine a White House that said, \u2018Do whatever it takes to test everybody for the virus,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t the mentality. It was the opposite mentality, and ultimately the responsibility to protect the American people lies with the White House.\u201d\n\nTrump and other officials have falsely said they declined to use the WHO test because it isn\u2019t reliable.\n\n\u201cQuality testing for our American people is paramount to us,\u201d Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the U.S. coronavirus response, said last week. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a bad test,\u201d Trump chimed in.\n\nTarik Ja\u0161arevi\u0107, a WHO spokesman, told the AP last week that his agency had shipped 1.5 million testing kits manufactured in Germany to 120 countries around the globe, with no such problems emerging.\n\n\u201cThe test has been validated in three external laboratories, adapted by WHO and manufactured in line with international quality standards,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has shown consistently good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false-positive nor false-negative results have been reported.\u201d\n\nOver the past two weeks, U.S. testing capacity has surged, with private companies joining in. LabCorp began providing tests March 5, and Quest Diagnostics followed four days later. Tests also are being conducted at hospitals and other centers.\n\nWith the increased testing has come a skyrocketing number of confirmed cases, zooming from 43 at the beginning of March to 33,404 by Monday.\n\nOnly in the last few days has the United States finally begun testing more people each day than far smaller South Korea, according to data complied by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nJha estimates the U.S. should be testing 100,000 to 150,000 people per day \u2014 figures he said should be obtainable given the number of high-quality diagnostic labs in the country.\n\n\u201cWe certainly have the capacity. It\u2019s just we\u2019re not doing it,\u201d Jha said Thursday. \u201cWe are up to about 40,000 tests per day now \u2014 and so we are moving in the right direction. Still far from where we need to be, but moving.\u201d\n\n___","category":"shelter_in_place","population":26098.0}

The order took effect immediately.\n\n\"We must take strong and proactive action at this time,\" Vail said.\n\nVail's announcement follows Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's executive order barring most gatherings of more than 250 people. Ingham County, which as of mid-day Sunday had only one confirmed case of the coronavirus, becomes the second Michigan county to cut capacity of bars and restaurants by 50% after Oakland County did so on Saturday.\n\nThe exterior of The Riv, a bar in downtown East Lansing, pictured late Saturday afternoon, March 14, 2020. (Photo: Robert Killips)\n\nVail's announcement also follows several days of MSU students lined up outside and packed into East Lansing's downtown bars, which prompted East Lansing city officials on Saturday to advocate for tighter restrictions on gatherings.\n\nSince MSU announced last week that most classes would be taught online rather than in person, students have been congregating at bars, sometimes creating block-long lines. City officials' concerns were heightened by the approach of St. Patrick's Day, which is Tuesday.\n\nLines outside bars, restaurants 'a different situation'\n\nMany East Lansing establishments have a legal capacity less than 250 people, but East Lansing officials were concerned nonetheless.\n\nSome took their worries public in Saturday posts to social media. City Council Member Jessy Gregg posted a photo to Facebook showing a mid-day line stretching outside The Riv, a bar on M.A.C. Avenue.\n\nThe line had disbursed by 3 p.m. Saturday following public calls from council members for students and business owners to abide by social distancing. A Riv employee declined to comment.\n\n\"You can't have six feet of social distance when you're elbow to elbow in a bar,\" East Lansing Mayor Ruth Beier observed on Saturday.\n\nMaking ends meet: The wages are low for Lansing retail workers. The risks for coronavirus exposure are high.\n\nWhere is coronavirus? Map shows coronavirus cases in Michigan, Indiana, beyond\n\nThe mayor also suggested on Saturday that the city was exploring the legality of options including a temporary prohibition on alcohol sales or a temporary shutdown of bars.\n\n\u201cThe real concern is not about today, but tonight,\" City Council Member Aaron Stephens, himself a recent MSU graduate, said on Saturday afternoon. \"The MSU students, I hate to say this, but they are using this as an excuse to go out and party. Now is not the time to do that.\u201d\n\nBy Saturday night, MSU President Samuel Stanley, himself a medical doctor, had emailed the student body to announce the extension of online only instruction though the end of the semester and to postpone commencement ceremonies.\n\nBut while MSU is encouraging students to return to their hometowns, campus officials are keeping residence halls and dining halls running to serve international students and others who can't leave campus before semester's end.\n\nStanley also used the moment Saturday night to chastise students over images of lines outside bars.\n\n\"I want to remind everyone again, that this is a time for personal responsibility and personal hygiene \u2014 make smart decisions to keep yourself healthy and please consider those around you,\" Stanley wrote in his letter.\n\nWhile Vail\u2019s order may further reduce crowds allowed inside restaurants and bars, it does nothing to break up lines outside.\n\n\u201cThis is all about indoors,\u201d Vail said. \u201cOutdoors is a different situation.\u201d\n\nCrowd control for lines outside of restaurants and bars is a public safety issue for law enforcement, Vail said.\n\nBeier said city officials are looking at their options.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the lines outside, our attorney doesn\u2019t think we have the right to say we can disperse you based on health reasons,\u201d Beier said.\n\nPolice officers could disperse lines if they blocked the sidewalk, Beier said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really hard thing to enforce outside,\u201d Beier said. \u201cThat\u2019s where we really need people to make the right decision.\u201d\n\nPeople should stay home and not create unnecessary health risks by standing in line, she said.\n\n\u201cUse your big brains and stay home,\u201d Beier said.\n\nState stepping up enforcement\n\nMeanwhile, state and local law enforcement will begin citing establishments that do not follow Whitmer's executive order, Attorney General Dana Nessel said during a Sunday afternoon news conference. A citation for violating the order is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum $250 day and potentially up to 90 days in jail.\n\n\"No one wants to shut down the food and beverage industry but also no one wants the coronavirus,\" Nessel said.\n\nThe attorney general said she expects local law enforcement will forward any potential cases to her office.\n\nThe state has not yet cited a business for violating the executive order, Nessel said.\n\nAnd bars and restaurants that ignore the executive order could face consequences beyond the misdemeanor citation, Nessel said. Further actions could include the loss of liquor licenses or the closure of their businesses.\n\n\"The consequences down the road may be severe,\" Nessel said.\n\nMeanwhile, both the governors of Ohio and Illinois ordered all their state's bars and restaurants to close in an effort to fight the coronavirus. In Ohio, closings were ordered to start at 9 p.m. on Sunday and in Illinois at midnight Monday.\n\nReporter Sarah Lehr contributed to this report.

It\u2019s the first time in the city\u2019s history such an emergency declaration has been made, Jackson spokesman Aaron Dimick said.\n\nThe announcement was made the morning of Tuesday, March 17, shortly before Jackson County announced its first positive test for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n\"It is a precautionary measure,\" Dimick said. \"If this is something that spreads through Jackson County over the next couple weeks, this could be a huge drain on our city services.\"\n\nAs mayor, Dobies can unilaterally call a state of emergency, Dimick said.

It also makes it easier for the city to receive state or federal aid to address the situation.\n\nCity workers are setting up hand-washing and hand-sanitizing stations around Jackson on Tuesday afternoon as a measure to fight the spread of the virus. The city is renting portable stations from Lester Brothers and setting them up at the following 10 locations:\n\nBlackman Park at CP Federal City Square, 212 W.

Officials are looking into ways to host the meetings remotely so people can watch and still participate in public comment \u2013 perhaps by calling in, Dimick said.\n\nAny special meetings will be announced with a few days notice, he said.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer has banned gatherings of more than 250 people, ordered all K-12 schools shut down and barred restaurants from offering dine-in service as measures to fight the spread of the disease.

If they choose us, as far as the RFI, then we would get the RFI at a later date,\u201d he continued.\n\nSince the last board meeting, he and Economic Improvement Director Todd Dickerson attended a spaceport facilities site visit in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Also taking part were Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport (OWA) Manager Gary Kellan and OWA Authority member Dave Dailey.\n\nThe delegation was held Feb. 4-7, and MAMA invited its members to participate in the event.\n\nThe visit included stops at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, Patrick Air Force Base and other commercial space companies within the Cape Canaveral area.\n\nSchaeffer noted that the Kennedy Space Center visit also entailed a tour of the vehicle assembly building.\n\nAccording to the NASA website, the iconic facility serves as the central hub of NASA\u2019s premier multi-user spaceport, capable of hosting several different kinds of rockets and spacecraft at the same time.\n\nSchaeffer told board members that it was very interesting to meet some of the other players associated with the spaceport who are currently operating in Cape Canaveral, and what that ecosystem would look like for the next steps in the spaceport.\n\nHe also said he and Dickerson were informed that the new date for the announcement \u2013 on the horizontal component for the MAMA\/Michigan Launch Initiative (MLI) \u2013 will be Tuesday, Feb. 18. \u201cAnd so we are hopeful that the announcement goes in the community\u2019s favor.\u201d\n\nAs reported, following the MLI site visit in Oscoda last year, it was revealed that the preferred spaceport location in the state would be announced in early January.\n\nTownship officials were expecting to hear at their Jan. 27 meeting whether the community had been chosen as the Michigan site of a potential spaceport operation. Schaeffer, however, advised that the decision had been bumped back again, after the announcement was initially supposed to come on Jan. 2, and then on Jan. 22.\n\nAs Kellan has pointed out, MAMA Executive Director Gavin Brown indicated that the goal is to bring the governor\u2019s office up to speed on the project before any formal announcement of the selected sites. Therefore, getting on the governor\u2019s schedule has been a driving factor in this.\n\nBrown says MAMA has been engaged in Phase I work on the MLI, which involves the feasibility of sites for both vertical and horizontal launch capabilities. When an announcement is made regarding the site(s) which meet and exceed the highest value, this location will serve as the basis to move forward with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licensing for a spaceport for both\/individually, vertical and horizontal launches serving LEO\/MEO\/suborbital, polar orbit demand.\n\nUpon choosing the Michigan spaceport site \u2013 be it in Oscoda or elsewhere \u2013 the candidate will then have to compete nationally for licensing through the FAA Space System program.\n\nAs noted in MAMA\u2019s Jan. 28 press release, with the rapid development of horizontal and vertical space launch facilities coming to Michigan, the association is collaborating with partners such as the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Michigan National Guard to build a command and control center to support the launch and daily operations of satellites.\n\nThe news release announced the start of a location search for a command and control center to manage commercial satellite operations and provide U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) support to such branches as Space Force.\n\nAs noted in the document, Michigan is leading Mid-America\u2019s space efforts by creating an ecosystem of space technology, launch facilities and now a space communications ground support station. The high-tech communications center will be an important growth contributor to Michigan and the surrounding region economies, serving the LEO, MEO and hypersonic space industries.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to build Michigan\u2019s international space influence with technology, manufacturing, and launch assets, providing a communications telemetry center will enhance our leadership growth in the space satellite industry,\u201d Brown stated. \u201cProviding a complete ecosystem of value to the commercial and DoD space marketplace is what we are building.\u201d\n\nAs for the command and control center, RFIs and the requirements detailing the process will be provided to qualified applicants, and site submissions will be evaluated on a variety of technical, economic and physical factors.\n\nAccording to those from MAMA, the developing space industry in the state also complements its past and present leadership in the automotive industry. With satellites providing the future communications for autonomous vehicle technology, Michigan\u2019s expansion into the space industry insures its technological edge for ground vehicles.\n\nFor more information about MAMA, visit www.michman.org.","category":"None","population":8379.0}

This could include the purchase of medical equipment without prior authorization and without going through the bid process, it was explained.\n\nBoard Chairman Justin Ahlers signed a temporary declaration late Tuesday afternoon, as plans were taking shape to close county office buildings to the public.\n\nOn Wednesday, the board took official action to close county buildings to the public. The buildings include the Nobles County Government Center in downtown Worthington, the Nobles County and Adrian branch libraries and the Nobles County Public Works facility.\n\n\u201cAll employees are to report to work at this time,\u201d Ahlers said, noting that a relaxed dress code is in place as employees will use the time to clean up areas within their offices and buildings.\n\nAccess to county services is available to the public via phone or email. Information and links to all departments may be found at co.nobles.mn.us.\n\nThe courts, county attorney\u2019s office and Rock-Nobles Community Corrections departments remain open inside the Prairie Justice Center, as required by the Minnesota Supreme Court.\n\nNobles County Attorney Joe Sanow said the courts will remain open for high priority and super high priority cases, including most felonies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mostly business as usual until the Supreme Court says otherwise,\u201d Sanow told commissioners Wednesday.\n\nWhile there was some discussion about library services, commissioners decided it would be safest to suspend operations at this time and until further notice. The libraries have drop boxes in place for people to return items, but because of the way the virus spreads, they did not want people to be able to check out library items or access the library computers.\n\nCommissioner Matt Widboom pointed out that the library does provide free internet access through wi-fi, and if people want to sit in their vehicles outside the library to access the internet, they are welcome to do so.\n\nThere was also discussion about the Ninth Street entrance to the Nobles County Government Center, which provides access to Worthington Public Utilities.\n\nWidboom said he wants all entrances to the building closed to the public, and noted WPU employees have access to their offices without using the public entrance. He also noted they have a payment box and the public can pay their utility bill through the box at this time.\n\n\u201cClosed means closed,\u201d Widboom said.\n\nJohnson said there is plenty of work for county employees to do, even though they won\u2019t be working face-to-face with the public.\n\n\u201cThe library\u2019s identified some things that have needed to be done for a while,\u201d he added.\n\nIn the community services department, Director Stacie Golombiecki said her staff is \u201cdoing everything we can to find creative solutions to meet with people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot of phone contact, and our case managers have made lists of our most vulnerable people and we\u2019ll check in that way,\u201d Golombiecki said. Work that requires home visits \u2014 including foster care \u2014 will be done through phone check-ins, she added.\n\nWith the close working quarters in the community services department, Widboom asked if employees there could spread out their work area.\n\n\u201cUse this room (the boardroom) and any other space you need to spread out, that\u2019s my thought,\u201d Widboom said.\n\n\u201cGenerally, everyone can work from a different location in the building,\u201d Golombiecki agreed.\n\nCommissioner Donald Linssen asked if there was a plan in place in the event a county employee contracted the virus, and noted concerns of the virus getting into the government building.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pulling all the stuff together that has to be done,\u201d Johnson responded. \u201cA formal plan is really challenging because there\u2019s so many unknowns.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Gene Metz asked about employee compensation, should a quarantine be necessary.\n\n\u201cRight now, if an employee doesn\u2019t feel safe here, they are allowed to go home,\u201d responded Human Resources Manager Sue Luing. \u201cThey just have to use their benefits \u2014 their family leave.\u201d\n\nTuesday\u2019s Nobles County Board meeting is still planned at this time, though the agenda will only include essential business. That means the public hearing on the proposed half-cent sales tax has been postponed indefinitely. Other agenda items that included reports from outside agencies will also be delayed.\n\nSince the law requires board meetings be open to the public, the plan at this time is to have someone at the front entrance to let people in for the 9 a.m. meeting.\n\n\u201cThis is difficult times \u2014 especially if you have families and children at home,\u201d said Linssen at the close of Wednesday\u2019s meeting. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of disruption going on.\u201d","category":"state_of_emergency","population":21617.0}

Here\u2019s what that means to citizens","text":"The Cass County Health Department continues to encourage basic preventative measures including washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. AP\n\nCass County is under a public health emergency order from the Cass County Health Department until at least April 1 due to CDC recommended precautions in relation to the COVID-19 virus.\n\nThe order closes all restaurants and restricts gatherings to fewer than 10 people. Cities within the county have also been worked hard to keep up with the changing situation: putting additional limitations into place, changing court dockets, and canceling meetings and events to protect residents.\n\nCass County Health Department Director Andrew Warlen issued the emergency order on March 17 to close all restaurants, dining facilities, bars, taverns, clubs and movie theaters in the county. These restrictions are similar to those already in place in neighboring Jackson County, which also prohibits groups of 10 or more from gathering unless it\u2019s related to the normal business operations of a facility.\n\n\u201cWe are working to make good decisions for Cass County with partners in the state and the region. We are trying to learn from others, and hopefully that will give us a huge advantage in handling this,\u201d Warlen said.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nThe order encourages as many businesses as possible to continue with normal operations while paying close attention to CDC recommended practices. Restaurants may continue to provide carry out, curbside, drive-thru and delivery service.\n\n\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is all the patrons inside the restaurant. If you think about going to a restaurant: you walk in the door, you touch the tables, you touch the menu, you are often putting food in your mouth, and that\u2019s a great way to spread the virus,\u201d Warlen said.\n\nWarlen explains the fast rate of transmission for the COVID-19 virus is the problem. Public health restrictions are aimed at reducing the rate of people getting sick. The yearly influenza virus similarly makes people sick and does also cause death, but influenza sicknesses generally occur over several months, which can be handled by the local health-care system. The rate of infection with the COVID-19 virus has been very rapid in comparison.\n\n\u201cIf we can\u2019t slow it down, everyone is going to become sick at once and it will overwhelm the healthcare system. That\u2019s what we can\u2019t have, and that\u2019s exactly what happened in Italy. Too many people got sick at once,\u201d Warlen said.\n\nThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Cass County came from Drexel.\n\nThe Cass County Health Department released limited information about the patient in Drexel, beyond that the patient was compliant with home quarantine and following CDC regulations. The Health Department is working to identify and contact people who may have been in danger of infection because of interaction with the individual.\n\nThroughout the county, cities have also pledged to follow Cass County regulations, while making their own adjustments to court dockets, city business, sports and recreation programming, and events.\n\nThe City of Harrisonville closed all city facilities indefinitely and is asking residents to refrain from public gatherings no matter how many people are in attendance. City residents are encouraged to pay utility bills online. The 17th Circuit Municipal court dockets are canceled until April 3. Cases on the docket will get a new court date. Defendants and attorneys will be notified in the mail of the new dates.\n\nRaymore has pledged to stop utility shut offs for 30 days in order to help people who may have a challenge paying bills. However, online bill pay and the drop box are still available for on time payments of bills. Bill payments may also be mailed.\n\nThe Raymore Activity Center and Centerview event center are closed until at least March 31. Recreation programming is suspended. Boards and commissions will not have meetings. A Community Little Cleanup scheduled for March 21 as well as the Friday Food Fest scheduled for March 27 were both canceled.\n\nRaymore Communications Manager Melissa Harmer says it is important for cities to pay attention to the latest recommendations from the CDC.\n\n\u201cThe only way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is to limit your interaction with other people. We want you to stay home,\u201d Harmer said. \u201cContinue frequent hand washing. Even though you might feel completely healthy, you could still be a carrier.\u201d\n\nWhile City Hall remains open in Raymore, residents are encouraged to do as much business as possible over the phone or online. Upcoming March and April court dockets have been moved to May in Raymore.\n\nIn Belton, Mayor Jeff Davis sent a message to citizens encouraging basic precautionary measures for all residents.\n\n\u201cPlease stay home if you begin to feel unwell or experience any of the symptoms like tiredness, dry cough and fever,\u201d Davis said in a message to residents.\n\nBelton has canceled city council meetings scheduled for March 24 and April 14.\n\nThe City of Peculiar has suspended all recreation activities and classes through April 13. The Recreation Soccer League, Youth Flag Football League, Youth Volleyball League, Little Soccer Kickers, Total Body Fitness, and Yoga Mind & Body are all included. Peculiar Parks and Recreation will provide all necessary updates to participants and families as they arise.\n\nThe Cass County Health Department continues to encourage basic preventative measures including washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Stay home if you are sick. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces frequently.\n\nWarlen additionally suggests residents take care of those who are older or immune compromised from a distance, only.\n\n\u201cGet their groceries for them. Call them. Skype them. E-mail them. Facebook live them, but keep away from them,\u201d Warlen said.\n\nThe most recent information on recommendations from the Cass County Health Department concerning COVID-19 can be found at www.casscounty.com\/2450\/covid-19.","category":"None","population":100641.0}

Authorities say the boy's father, who had custody of the boy, Braedence Jones, went to pick him up at Ferguson's home in August 2018, but he and his mother weren't there. Law enforcement officers found the boy in January 2019 at a home in rural Laclede County.\n\nCourt documents said the door of the attic crawl space was nailed shut and hidden under carpet and furniture.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol issued an Endangered Child Advisory for Braedence in October of 2018, two months after he disappeared with his mother. Bradence's father and Ferguson shared custody of the boy. However, he lived with his father.","category":"None","population":35667.0}

With the introduction of the coronavirus the district purchased three additional machines to clean 2 million square feet of space inside the district's buildings. Students are scheduled to return Monday from break. Robert Cohen\n\nMissouri Gov. Mike Parson on Friday declared a state of emergency in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus and announced the state has two more presumptive positive cases, bringing the total to four.\n\nOne of the new cases is a St. Louis County resident in the 50s who case is believed to be related to domestic travel, Parson said in a statement. Details on the other case have not been released yet.\n\nAt a news conference, Parson said he considered declaring the state of emergency \u201cthe next appropriate step to protect the public health\u201d and stressed the move was not made because of concerns that the state's health care system is overwhelmed or unprepared.\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of this emergency declaration is to provide greater flexibility in allocating our state resources, not because the local health providers feel they are overwhelmed,\u201d Parson told reporters in his Capitol office.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nDeclaring a state of emergency gives Parson the ability to tap into about $7 million of state disaster funds, which he said can be used for coronavirus response efforts.\n\nParson also said he did not intend to close the state's schools, as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker did on Friday. Parson said school districts should seek guidance from local health officials in deciding whether to close schools.\n\nHowever, the University of Missouri System announced in a Friday statement that in-person classes have been suspended for the rest of the spring semester at the system's flagship campus in Columbia and its three other campuses in Kansas City, St. Louis and Rollo. Campus housing, dining halls, libraries and broadband internet will remain available to students, the statement said.\n\nAlso on Friday, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, who is a physician, banned all events in the county attended by more than 250 people amid a flurry of closures of athletic events, parades and even church services.\n\nDetection efforts also were intensifying. The Mercy health system announced that a drive-thru coronavirus testing facility could open as soon as Saturday in the St. Louis suburb of Chesterfield. Mercy said it also plans to open more testing sites in Missouri and the other three states where it operates \u2014 Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nMeanwhile, a Missouri health department spokeswoman said the agency is working to fix a glitch with a hotline the state set up to answer questions about the virus. Calls to the hotline from out-of-state numbers wouldn't go through as of Friday afternoon.\n\nMissouri's first confirmed case of COVID-19 was a St. Louis-area woman in her 20s who had been studying in Italy and tested positive for the coronavirus last week after returning home.\n\nThe state's second case is a person in their early 20s who had recently traveled to Austria, Parson said Thursday. The patient was tested at a clinic in Springfield, is quarantined at home with mild symptoms and is expected to recover, Parson said.\n\nParson on Friday said the state is working out agreements to allow Washington University and the University of Missouri to conduct coronavirus tests and expand the state's testing capacity.\n\nThe World Health Organization has labelled the coronavirus a pandemic and President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.\n\nKansas City Public Schools decided to close on Friday, one day before the start of spring break. Most students in the district receive free and reduced-priced lunch. Ray Weikal, a KCPS spokesman, said the district has been \u201cplanning for services like food distribution, virtual learning and deep cleaning in case we cancel school after spring break,\" The Kansas City Star reported.\n\n\u201cWe know that our families depend on us for multiple services, and we commit to continuing to support our families in the event of future closures,\u201d Weikal said.\n\nThe private Barstow School in Kansas City, canceled classes for Thursday and Friday ahead of a two-week spring break due to virus exposure concerns.\n\nSchool officials said a family member of a school employee tested positive for COVID-19. School officials canceled classes as a precaution but said the infected person hasn't visited the campus, and the related school employee has shown no symptoms. No students or other school staff were exposed.\n\nSpokeswoman Lisa Tulp said students and staff may be able to return March 30, or \u201cwe may have to move to online.\u201d\n\nSeveral universities in the state have moved to online classes.\n\nParson asked the Legislature to authorize $13 million in federal emergency funding to address the coronavirus.\n\nKansas City and St. Louis have banned all public events with more than 1,000 attendees. St. Patrick's Day parades in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield have been canceled. Six Flags St. Louis announced that it has suspended operation until at least the end of March.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Corrections announced Thursday that Missouri\u2019s 20 state-run prisons will be closed to visitors, with the exception of attorneys, for the next 30 days. Parson on Friday said the Department of Mental Health and Missouri veterans' homes also are restricting visitors.\n\nSt. Louis Circuit Court suspended all jury trials through April 13 and walk-in weddings at the county courthouse on Friday afternoons will be suspended on March 30 and April 3.\n\nEntertainment venues in Kansas City and St. Louis also announced closings or cancellations for the next few weeks. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Arts in Kansas City will be closed Saturday through April 3 and the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts said it will postpone all events through April 1. Also, the St. Louis Art Museum and Contemporary Art Museum will remain open but are canceling tours, special events and lectures starting Sunday through April 30.\n\nChurches also were calling off services, including the Church of the Resurrection, which has the largest Methodist congregation in the U.S. with over 20,000 members. The megachurch's main campus is in Leawood, Kansas, but it has campuses on the Missouri side of the line.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":15544.0}

Life as we know it has changed and will remain different for weeks to come. No one knows how long these changes will have to stay in place. We do know that the more everyone works together to stop the spread of the disease, the more quickly life will return to normal.\n\nThe leadership of the county and city and their partners are working together to implement plans that have been in place for a number of years as well as developing new plans to address the different challenges this particular virus has caused. The decision to issue an Emergency Declaration by the County was to provide clear guidance on what is expected of our community, acknowledge this is an emergency situation and open up resources to support the response of our government entities, we are trying to provide the most up to date information available, but information is changing very quickly.\n\nThe Pettis County Health Center and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services along with the CDC are the best places to look for correct, factual information. There is a lot of misinformation circulating around social media.\n\nOne major area of concern is related to testing for the Coronavirus. There has been a lot of information from the Federal government that testing will be widely available. There are more tests available than when testing began and more coming. Testing is for people who are ill with a fever of 100.4, cough, shortness of breath and a risk factor including travel to specific countries and counties or direct contact with a person who has a lab confirmed case of Coronavirus.\n\nWhen drive-through testing becomes available, we will let the community know where and how to obtain the test. New testing facilities are coming on line quickly. There should be enough testing materials available by April I, please be patient \u2014 people are being tested based on symptoms, not who they are. If you feel you have symptoms, please call your doctor before going to the office. Do not go to the Emergency Room unless you are seriously ill.\n\nIf you are told that you may have been exposed to the virus and are sent home, that means you need to stay IN YOUR HOME for 14 days. This does not mean going to the store or visiting with friends. If you need help with getting groceries or medicines, reach out to friends and families who may be able to take care of those items- We are working on setting up a telephone line for community residents to call if there is no one else who can help you get what you need.\n\nAs the guidance from Governor Parson regarding public gathering is changing we are following the first guidance he outlined. However, if at all possible, groups should be limited to 10 people until the end of March. Listed below is what needs to happen\n\n1. All events that would have more than 50 people are to be cancelled or rescheduled. This includes meetings, weddings, concerts, plays, event barns\/venues, social clubs and fund raising events. We are asking businesses to work with customers who must reschedule events. Please support the important charitable organizations that had fundraisers scheduled during the next several months.\n\n2. The Governor's direction does not include schools, child care facilities and businesses. However, restaurants and bars are considered public gathering spaces which are addressed separately. Those organizations will make closing decisions based on information from state agencies and public health officials. All of these organizations are working with public health about closures decisions.\n\n3. Restaurants and bars need to limit the number of people in the facility to 50 or less at a time. There should be encouragement for patrons to wash their hands, for those restaurants that can, takeout and delivery should be used as much as possible. All restaurants should remove items that are touched by multiple people such as ketchup bottles, salt and pepper and other common items. Menus should be cleaned between customers. We have been asked to do this for at least the next 15 days.\n\nWhen shopping, please support our local businesses if possible. Some of our local businesses have on line shopping options that will help us through this situation. Supporting our local businesses will help them to survive and be there when life returns to normal. Please do not buy more than you need, we need to have enough food and necessities for all of our community.\n\nWe all need to continue to do those things that help keep us safe \u2014 stay home if you are sick, wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, eyes and mouth, stay home as much as possible. Staying home is very important for those over 65 years of age, have chronic illnesses or have a decreased immune system. Please do not go to visit people in the hospital if you are sick. The hospital is closed to visitors. However, please do call and check on your family and neighbors to ensure they have what they need such as medicines and food.\n\nThis pandemic will pass we just do not know how long it will take. Everyone will need to be patient as we all learn to live with a slower pace of life. Take time to catch up with people you have been meaning to call, write a letter or send a card to brighten the day of another, talk to your family. Try to view this as the pause in a busy life not something that is impossible to live with.\"","category":"state_of_emergency","population":42205.0}

Steve Bullock\u2019s proclamation of a state of emergency for Montana, the county-level resolution gives the board authority to raise two mills in response to the crisis.\n\nDollars raised by an emergency levy can only be spent with the unanimous decision of county commissioners, according to state code. Money raised during a crisis that goes unspent must be set aside for future emergencies.\n\nCounty Commissioner Jerry Bennett (D-2), who made the motion to declare a state of emergency, said the board had no immediate plans to raise money.\n\n\u201cI move to approve, but just with the clear understanding that this is just a formality,\u201d he said.\n\nThe board voted unanimously to approve the measure.\n\nCommissioner Mark Peck (D-1) said there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county as yet, but wanted to ensure the board was getting accurate and up-to-date information from the jurisdiction\u2019s health department. Commissioners broke from the meeting\u2019s agenda to call health officials in for an unplanned public briefing.\n\n\u201cI think it would be good for them to be briefing us,\u201d Peck said. \u201cOur public health folks should probably be shooting us daily updates on what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nDuring the briefing, Health Department Director Kathi Hooper sought permission to hire temporary staff to help with virus testing. Asked how many, Hooper and Public Health Director Jennifer McCully said at least one more person to start.\n\nCurrently, the department has a single staff member handling testing countywide. Trying to cover Eureka, Libby and Troy has left resources stretched thin, Hooper said.\n\n\u201cWe lose her for half a day when she has to run up to Eureka for testing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to hire a 90 day temp up in Eureka, [someone] who is a nurse who could respond when needed for testing.\u201d\n\nInstead, commissioners directed the department to hire two temporary staff members immediately. They gave Hooper and McCully permission to hire a third if necessary.\n\n\u201cIt would not hurt to find three and hire two right away,\u201d Peck said.\n\nMcCully and Hooper told the commissioners they already had a person in mind in Eureka. The challenge with hiring two additional staffers would be finding candidates with the necessary qualifications, McCully said.\n\nBecause of the logistical limitations on COVID-19 tests, the health department staff is continuing to meet with individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. Were tests to become available in mass quantities, officials could create a centralized site, McCully said.\n\nIn other parts of the country, like California, Massachusetts and Texas, drive through coronavirus testing facilities have sprung up.\n\nFor now, though, officials in Lincoln County want residents who suspect they may have the illness to contact the health department at 406-293-6295.\n\n\u201cI would like to, for as long as possible, meet people where they are at \u2026 until we are in a place to do drive through testing,\u201d McCully said.\n\nOn the same day, officials with the Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office announced the discontinuation of non-emergency business. That includes canceling jail visitations; the 24\/7 alcohol-screening program and drug patches; issuing concealed weapon permits and renewals; and conducting background check fingerprints and VIN inspections. Fees incurred for late concealed weapons permit renewals as a result of the measures would be waived, officials wrote in a statement.\n\nDetention center personnel will no longer accept money for inmates through the sheriff\u2019s office lobby, officials said. Instead, cash, check or money orders could be sent to 512 California Avenue addressed to the inmate and the detention center.\n\nOfficials also warned that the agency will employ a \u201climited patrol response\u201d for incidents where a crime has not been committed and there are no safety or security concerns.\n\nAuthorities urged residents to file reports by phone at 406-293-4112 ext. 1231.\n\n\u201cThe Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office will continue to actively patrol our community to provide the safety and security of our citizens,\u201d read the statement. \u201cHowever, we are taking the above precautions to both limit exposure and the potential of carrying and passing COVID-19.\u201d","category":"state_of_emergency","population":19460.0}

This is where pandemic becomes very, very real. We\u2019re not only talking about only economic impacts from a pandemic, we\u2019re talking about people\u2019s jobs, and we\u2019re talking about businesses and their livelihoods. This is not what any of us ever hope to do. We are in a situation that is unprecedented. We need to take whatever steps we can to limit the impact of this disease,\" Yellowstone County Health Officer John Felton said at a press conference Monday.\n\nRead the full order here.\n\nRestaurants are allowed to sell take out food, according to the order signed by Felton.\n\n\u201cThe restaurants will be closed to dine-in customers. However if they have takeout or delivery services, those can continue,\" Felton said.\n\nIn addition, food service establishments that serve a specific population, such as a universities or nursing homes with dining halls or cafeterias, will remain open.\n\nThe ban lasts through midnight March 23, which is next Monday.\n\nFelton said the temporary restaurant shutdown gives health officials time to assess the COVID-19 spread in the community. It also gives health officials the time to work with restaurant operators to implement social distancing protocol in restaurant operation.\n\n\u201cIt also gives us some time to work with those operators to begin to identify other things to help with social distancing, the idea of keeping people far enough away from each other or have less risk to the exposure of disease,\" Felton said.\n\nSix cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Montana, including one in Yellowstone County. A seventh case involved a Montana woman who tested positive out of state in Maryland.\n\n\u201cWe know that in the next few days we will start to receive a very large number of test results coming back. That will certainly be helpful in determining how widespread the disease is and what the extent of community spread is,\" Felton said.\n\nFelton said local establishments will be notified of the order to close, and the decision was not made lightly.\n\n\u201cThis was not a decision that was made easily or rapidly. We have a very close-knit public health community. There has been a lot of communication between our local health officers, the state health department, and trying to figure out the best way to go about this. Although it seems sudden because it\u2019s here, it is not something that sort of came up in the last hour or two,\" Felton said.\n\nThe health officer order is enforceable by police, but Felton doesn't expect to run into that problem.\n\n\"In what I believe to be the extremely unlikely circumstance that someone decided they were going to operate in defiance of this order, our approach is always educational first to make sure they know what the order is and how long it will last. If someone still refused, then we would be forced to involved law enforcement to stop the operation. It is a legally enforceable order,\" Felton said.\n\nGymnasium and theater operators are exempt from this order because social distancing procedures can be followed at those establishments, Felton said.\n\n\u201cIt appears that most of the gym operators have already canceled fitness classes. Which leaves free weights and machine exercises to do, which creates a sort of natural social distancing. With respect to theaters, it seems like there\u2019s enough room in most theaters where people can spread out,\" Felton said.\n\nFelton said community health leaders have planned for pandemics in the past, but this is the first to see this kind of response.\n\n\u201cThis is truly an unprecedented situation in which we find ourselves. We have planned for pandemics. We thought several diseases in the past might do this: H1N1 flu, SARS, MERS. For just about everyone around today, this is the really gigantic pandemic we would have to deal with,\" Felton said.","category":"None","population":154162.0}

Robinette says they talked to 40 counties across Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas that currently operate wind turbines, and none reported issues with their local GPS equipment operating close to the turbines.\n\nCuming County Public Power District General Manager Chet McWhorter says not more than one wind turbine is needed in the county.\n\nMcWhorter says why the board went ahead and went with the project had to do with the ability to hedge against future rate increases, to have a little bit of local control on some energy issues, and to provide economic growth and development in the county.\n\nLerch says the turbine would come down and be removed to at least 4 feet below ground level if it can\u2019t be redone after its lifetime.\n\nClick here to listen to Interview with Lerch","category":"None","population":8996.0}

(Photo: Bill Armendariz - Headlight Photo)\n\nDEMING \u2013 Luna County Commissioners voted unanimously to approve County Resolution 20-25, declaring a county-wide state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic that is gripping the nation. The resolution was adopted at noon on Monday during a special meeting of the Luna County Board of Commissioners.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, the New Mexico Department of Health has confirmed 65 positive cases in the state, including four cases in nearby Dona Ana County. This comes from https:\/\/cv.nmhealth.org\/ where reports indicate 5,386 COVID-19 tests have been performed and 5,321 have come back negative.\n\n\u201cDefinitely respect the social distancing at this time and limit travel only for essential needs,\u201d said Luna County Manager Chris Brice. \u201cThe virus itself is not that dangerous to the majority of the population, but if we get enough people who are infected then out hospitals get overrun and the physical capacity to isolate a great number of people becomes a problem.\u201d\n\nThe county-wide state of emergency is a necessary resolution to allow Luna County government to apply for state and federal relief funds during this global crisis. \u201cCOVID-19 is certainly something we have to guard against, but the economic impact of this is also a concern,\" Brice said.\n\nBrice also noted $50,000 has been put on a separate line item to handle immediate expenditures the county must track. Luna County's Starmax Family Entertainment Center and the Mimbres Valley Special Events Center have been shut down and are directly impacted by the state mandates.\n\nThe migrant relief crisis in Luna County of 2019 was a valuable lesson to county government. The county is still seeking reimbursement for the expenditures during the 31,000 Central American migrants who purged through Luna County seeking asylum.\n\n\u201cEssentially our chain of command has been established through emergency management and we are more familiar with the operations,\u201d Brice explained in terms of preparation for this event. \u201cWe are better prepared.\u201d\n\nDistrict 2 Commissioner Linda Smrkovsky told the Headlight the resolution needed to be put forth to follow the state and federal guidelines and to ensure the safety of the citizens of Luna County. \u201cWe need to be cautious at this time, and this measure will help us in the long run.\u201d\n\nThe meeting was attended by a few county employees and a handful of citizens, as county officials recommended the public stay at home. Seating arrangements distanced the audience six feet apart during the meeting.\n\n\u201cThis is costing the county money in different areas,\u201d said District 3 Commissioner John Sweetser. \u201cIf there is money available from state or federal, this resolution puts us in line for that.\u201d\n\nBrice reminded citizens to support local businesses through the state mandated health order. \u201cOrder take-out service at our local restaurants. Buy gift cards from businesses. They need your support now while our economy is hurting.\u201d\n\nBill Armendariz can be reached at 575-546-2611 (ext. 2606) or biarmendariz@demingheadlight.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.demingheadlight.com\/story\/news\/2020\/03\/23\/luna-county-officials-declare-county-wide-state-emergency\/2901962001\/","category":"state_of_emergency","population":24659.0}

Michelle Lujan Grisham lifts her State of Emergency declaration.\n\nThe petition is set to be heard Tuesday by Chief District Judge George Eichwald.\n\nThe move marks the first time a voice from outside New Mexico\u2019s criminal defense community has called for releasing inmates amid the growing COVID-19 crisis. Hammer has a different client. She represents Sandoval County leadership, including the jail itself, not people locked up in the jail.\n\nOver the weekend, Bennet Baur, the state\u2019s chief public defender, made a similar request in a letter to the state Supreme Court. He also cited the potential health risks should the virus find its way into a jail. And days later, the New Mexico Criminal Defense Lawyers Association asked the state\u2019s highest court to identify \u201cvulnerable populations\u201d who could be released from jails.\n\nReached by telephone Thursday evening, Hammer, a longtime prosecutor and former lead investigator for the now-revamped Albuquerque Police Oversight Commission, declined to comment \u201cbeyond what is in the writ.\u201d\n\nThe document says Sandoval County housed 204 inmates as of Thursday, and no one had, as of that date, tested positive for COVID-19. About 100 staff watch over the jail.\n\nAdhering to instructions from Lujan Grisham\u2019s administration to stop the spread of the virus by social distancing \u2014 staying at least six feet away from other people \u2014 is difficult, if not impossible in a jail, Hammer wrote.\n\nA jail\u2019s close-quarters confinement creates health risks during a public health pandemic \u2014 one that outweighs \u201cthe lower level of risk to the public posed by persons accused of misdemeanor or non-violent felony crimes\u201d or even some people being held in the jail post-conviction, her petition says.\n\nAttached to the petition is an affidavit sworn out by the health service administrator for the medical company that operates in the jail under contract with Sandoval County. The administrator said \u201cit is to the benefit of both staff members and detainees to limit the contact between individuals during this health emergency.\u201d\n\nThe petition was sent to Baur and to 13th Judicial District Attorney Lemuel Martinez.\n\nMartinez did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nIn an interview, Baur commended Hammer and the county, calling the petition a \u201cstrong measure in the middle of a health emergency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate Sandoval County stepping up on behalf of the health of people in its facility,\u201d he said. \u201cJust thinking about what could happen: Someone arrested can bring the virus into the facility, and someone could get it inside and bring it out. Here we have, not just an advocate for incarcerated people, but a custodian of people in custody sounding the alarm.

Classes will resume April 14.\n\nBono said Saturday all county departments will remain open until further notice.\n\nHave questions about the new coronavirus? Here are some answers:\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?\n\nThe Centers for Control and Prevention say that fever, cough and shortness of breath often appear two to 14 days after exposure to the coronavirus. Emergency warning signs include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse and bluish lips or face. This and other concerning symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately, according to the CDC.\n\nI think I have coronavirus. What should I do?\n\nCall ahead before you visit a doctor and alert your local health department, according to the CDC. For example, the Slocum-Dickson Medical Group in New Hartford recently had to advise they are not a testing facility.\n\nIf you are sick with the coronavirus or suspect you are, the CDC recommends you stay home and separate yourself from other people and pets in your home. If it is confirmed you have the virus, you should remain home until transmission risk is low.\n\nTake other precautions like wearing a face mask, washing your hands often and disinfecting surfaces.\n\nSo, who do I call to get tested?\n\nCall your health care provider, says Oneida County Health Director Phyllis D. Ellis. Your doctor can discuss with you further about your specific case and they can arrange where and when you\u2019ll get tested.\n\nHow does the test work?\n\nSimilar to getting tested for the flu, you are swabbed and that swab is delivered to a lab, says Ellis. The results vary, but it could take up to a couple of days, she says, and in the meantime, stay quarantined.\n\nHow does the virus spread?\n\nThe CDC reports that COVID-19, or the new coronavirus, appears to be spreading easily in affected areas. The virus mainly spreads person-to-person, such as by inhaling droplets from when a sick person coughs or sneezes, according to the CDC. It is also thought that someone could touch an object that has the virus on it, and then by touching their mouth, nose or eyes become infected. It is thought that the disease mainly spreads from those showing symptoms but has been reported to spread from those not showing symptoms.\n\nThere are confirmed cases of coronavirus in my area, how do I prevent the disease from spreading to me?\n\nThe CDC says the best way to prevent exposure is by washing your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water \u2014 and do it often, especially after being out in public, coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose. If you can\u2019t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.\n\nThe CDC says you should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with sick people, or the general public if the disease is spreading in your community.\n\nYou do not need to wear a face mask unless you are caring for someone who is sick and is not able to wear one, according to the CDC. Face masks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.\n\nWhat risks do I have if I get coronavirus?\n\nThose who are at a higher risk of getting sick from the disease include older adults and those with conditions like heart or lung disease and diabetes, according to the CDC. If that is the case, you must take extra caution. Stock up on supplies, keep 6 feet away from others, stay home as much as possible and avoid travel by air and cruise.\n\nI\u2019m pregnant and\/or have children. What are the risks there?\n\nThere is no evidence that children are more susceptible to coronavirus, and most cases in China occurred in adults, according to the CDC. But infections in children have been reported, including in very young children.\n\nPregnancy can increase a risk for infection, but it is not yet known if this means a higher risk for coronavirus, the CDC says. It is not yet known if coronavirus can cause complications in pregnancy or be passed on to the baby, but in the small number of infants born to mother with coronavirus, none tested positive for the disease and the virus was not found in amniotic fluid or breast milk.\n\nAnything else I should be doing to prepare?\n\nThe CDC recommends making sure you have enough household items, groceries and medication at home in case you have to self-quarantine. This includes asking your doctor or pharmacist about obtaining extra medication or using a mail-order prescription. Consider ways you can have food delivered to you either through a service or people you know.\n\nDoes this mean cutting myself off from everyone?\n\nNo. The CDC suggests keeping in touch with friends, family or community members for help. If you are caregiver, or have a caregiver, determine who takes care of them if they get sick, for example.\n\nSource: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

Since then, the number has jumped to 242 positive cases. There are sure to be more.\n\nSeveral hospitals across the state, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health, are already nearing their capacity. At any point in time, about 90 percent of the Birmingham area\u2019s 7,000 hospital beds are in use. Elective procedures are being canceled to make room for COVID-19 patients. About a fifth of those who acquire the virus require hospitalization.\n\nElective procedures can be canceled to free up hospital beds. New beds can be added to rooms to increase capacity. Old hospitals can be retrofitted if needed to increase the state\u2019s capacity to handle the surge \u2014 no, the \u201ctsunami\u201d \u2014 of cases public health officials expect is coming. These things are already being done. They can be done relatively easily.\n\nBut the most worrisome aspect of this COVID-19 pandemic is the fact that some 5 percent of those infected experience some form of respiratory failure. They will need intensive care and treatment with a ventilator. This phenomenon has already reached Alabama. UAB said Tuesday that their patient load of those with COVID-19 is already increasing exponentially.\n\nAt least 45 people are currently hospitalized at UAB Medical Center in Birmingham. Dozens more are under observation, and at least 18 of the 45\u2014some 40 percent\u2014are on ventilators. The number of hospitalized patients at UAB increased from 17 on Monday to 45 on Tuesday, according to the hospital.\n\nFor now, the hospital can handle the load. UAB is the state\u2019s largest and most advanced hospital. It has a deep bench of some of the best doctors and nurses in the world. But even UAB is developing contingency plans. \u201cIt is impossible to say if the current rate of hospitalization will remain the same, increase or drop,\u201d UAB Medicine spokesman Bob Shepard said. \u201cWe are developing plans to handle a surge of patients.\u201d\n\nBut other hospitals in the state are not as well-sourced, not as well-staffed, and in much more dire financial straits. Since 2000, more than 15 hospitals have closed across the state. The most recent was near my hometown in Pickens County. There are far more hospitals in the state operating in the red than hospitals in good financial position, according to the Alabama Hospital Association.\n\nThat leaves these health systems and small rural hospitals without the resources to acquire the beds and the number of ventilators they will need to care for the surge of patients experts expect to come in the next few weeks. Many of these hospitals do not have intensive care units at all. If they do, they are small.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe state\u2019s hospitals have about 1,344 ventilators on hand, according to the Alabama Hospital Association. On any given day, about 550 are in use on average. That means the state has a surge capacity of only 800 ventilators. These numbers should scare everyone in the state.\n\nI recently wrote about estimates from the Harvard Global Health Institute that suggest, even in the best-case scenario in which 20 percent of adults are infected in Alabama, some 34,370 people would need ICU care. We must take drastic measures to prepare for this surge now. The science, the experts, the data, the real-life experiences of Italy, New York and Louisiana tell us this is coming.\n\n\u201cWe are not California,\u201d Gov. Kay Ivey said on a conference call Tuesday. \u201cWe are not New York. We aren\u2019t even Louisiana.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, we are not, but we could be soon.\n\nGov. Ivey and the Alabama Department of Public Health have taken this crisis more seriously than many would have anticipated. They have moved swiftly since the first cases were reported less than two weeks ago. They\u2019ve placed harsh, but necessary, restrictions on restaurants and bars. They\u2019ve closed beaches. They\u2019re trying to get testing to everyone in the state. They\u2019ve instituted social-distancing guidelines. They\u2019re allowing out-of-state hospitals to come work in Alabama.\n\nBut more must be done.\n\nBy the time this crisis is gone, some 158,906 people could need to be hospitalized in the state, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute\u2019s most conservative estimates. Of course, all of those hospitalizations won\u2019t be at once, but if cases surge more quickly than we hope, if we do not take social distancing seriously, if we loosen the lockdowns, hospitals could be overwhelmed and would need to ration care.\n\nRationing hospital beds can be managed. Field hospitals can be opened. Beds can be placed in hospital hallways. Patients can double up in the same room, or even more.\n\nBut ventilators\u2026 Ventilators cannot effectively be rationed without people dying. If someone needs to be intubated, they must be intubated. Only so much can be done to conserve these life-saving machines.\n\nIf you want are dire look at how this would play out, just look at the state\u2019s disaster response plans. If we begin to run out of ventilators, older people, people with disabilities, and those with chronic conditions could be taken off ventilator support so someone else who is more likely to live (read: younger people) can have it. We do not want that to happen. It should not have to happen.\n\nOn the same conference call Tuesday, Dr. Scott Harris from the Alabama Department of Public Health said the state has been planning for the possibility of a surge that affects the state\u2019s hospitals. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happened in other parts of the world and the country, particularly in larger cities,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we know that over the course of two or three weeks a situation can look a lot different than it does now.\u201d\n\nHarris said the state has a group \u201cworking hard trying to find resources like tests and trying to find ventilators\u201d within the state and without. \u201cWe continue to do that just with the understanding that we\u2019re also competing against many other states who are trying to do the same thing,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Alabama Department of Public Health has an up-to-date database of hospitals\u2019 stocks of ventilators and their availability. Harris and Ivey said the state is trying to pursue public-private partnerships to get new machines. \u201cI\u2019ve been notified that there are several companies in Alabama that want to be as helpful to our state as possible,\u201d the governor said. \u201cAnd keep that in mind folks, to completely change your model of business cannot happen overnight for big products like ventilators. That\u2019s why we\u2019re relying on public and private partnerships to fulfill our needs.\u201d\n\nThe reality, though, is that every other state in the United States\u2014all 50 plus D.C. and Puerto Rico\u2014are trying to get ventilators, too. Dozens of other countries across the globe are trying to get ventilators. New York alone says it is trying to procure 30,000. Does Alabama even know how many we will need?\n\nThe federal government, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has offered to supply New York with 400. You read that right. 400 out of the 15,000 it requested. \u201cYou want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?\u201d Cuomo said Tuesday. Vice President Mike Pence later Tuesday said he would ship 2,000 from the national stockpile.\n\nBut there are likely not enough ventilators in the national stockpile.\n\nThis is not just an issue in Alabama. This is an issue across the country and the globe. Companies are not producing ventilators fast enough. New York needs the ventilators this week, Cuomo said, or sooner. The state cannot wait. Alabama and other states may not be far behind.\n\nSo what\u2019s the plan?\n\nThe plan now seems to be to hope that private companies will decide to make more ventilators. To hope that hospitals and states can find them themselves. The president has, so far, refused to invoke the Defense Production Act to order companies to make ventilators. (Though he did say Tuesday that he would use it to procure test kits.) The state of Alabama should put pressure on the president. We need ventilators. It is a matter of safety and security.\n\nThe plan now seems to be to wait and see, which could prove disastrous. We will wait to see what the federal government will do. We will follow their lead. But the pandemic snuck up on other states like New York and Louisiana, states that are now opening makeshift hospitals in convention centers and hooking up two patients to one ventilator despite that being a suboptimal solution. It will sneak up on us, too, if we don\u2019t act now.\n\nNew York, one of the richest states in the country, has said it can\u2019t afford the ventilators it needs because of the international bidding war. Why do we think Alabama, with its skim budgets, will be able to compete?\n\nThe state has not provided a detailed plan of how it plans to get ventilators. Will we buy them? Will we rent them? Will the state pay companies here to begin producing them? These are the answers we need now. And we need clear answers. Because if we are not planning ahead, we need to know. If we are, we need to know.\n\nAlabama cannot be at the last of the pack when so much is at stake.","category":"school_business_closure","population":119504.0}

Since that time, the President has recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\nIn North Carolina, 40 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with no deaths. In the United States, confirmed cases total 5,700 with 96 deaths; however, there has been a testing shortage coupled with the delay between testing and obtaining results, so officials believe the true figure could be higher. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 195,000 people with approximately 7,800 deaths.\n\nHow to protect yourself and others\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises citizens to: avoid close contact with people who are sick; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; stay home if you are sick; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue; and clean\/disinfect frequently touched surfaces or objects (tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.). The agency also advises citizens to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. In addition, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and put a six-foot distance between yourself and other people (i.e. social distancing). Learn more at www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/prepare\/prevention.html.\n\nWhat to do if you are sick\n\nIf you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have it, you should stay home as most people who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to recover at home. Wear a facemask when you are around other people. Do not leave, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas. Stay in touch with your doctor but call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you feel worse or you think it is an emergency. If you in a high-risk category (age 65+, underlying health issues, or immune-compromised), you should get tested for COVID-19 by making arrangements with the local health department, doctor\u2019s office, or hospital.

Human coronaviruses commonly circulate in the United States and usually cause mild illnesses like the common cold. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that was identified in Wuhan, China, and is now spreading throughout the world.\n\nStatement from the Alexander County Board of Commissioners\n\nAlexander County declares State of Emergency for COVID-19 (Coronavirus)\n\nOn Tuesday, March 17, the Alexander County Board of Commissioners held an emergency meeting to discuss COVID-19 (coronavirus) and how the county could play a proactive role in helping contain the spread of this illness.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the Board of Commissioners believed it would be in the best interest of Alexander County citizens, businesses, and employees to declare a State of Emergency.\n\nCommissioners heard reports from Emergency Services, Health Department, Social Services, and Administration, as well as information from a conference call with the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners which provided updates from various state agencies.\n\nWhile Alexander County currently has zero confirmed cases of COVID-19, the Board felt it would be a wise decision to be proactive and let our citizens know that we believe this could become a very serious health issue.\n\nWith this declaration, we believe that Alexander County is getting ahead of the game by increasing awareness of COVID-19, implementing facility closings, ensuring employee safety, and minimizing contact between people \u2014 all with the goal of ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of our citizens, and possibly saving lives.\n\nThe declaration also positions the county for potential state and federal funds if conditions worsen.\n\nPlease take this seriously. The magnitude of this virus and its effect on our county, state, nation, and world is not yet known, but together we will get through this potential crisis and emerge even stronger.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRyan Mayberry, Chairman\n\nLarry Yoder, Vice Chairman\n\nJeff Peal\n\nMarty Pennell\n\nRonnie Reese","category":"state_of_emergency","population":36930.0}

Seated to her right is Nathan Dowless, the director of Emergency Management. -\n\nELIZABETHTOWN \u2014 Bladen County has been declared in a State of Emergency, two county employee policies have been created, and publishing of delinquent tax listings was pushed back two months.\n\nIn an emergency meeting just shy of 90 minutes late Friday afternoon in Superior Courtroom No. 2 of the Bladen County Courthouse, county commissioners tasked themselves with receiving an update on COVID-19 and acting in response. There is yet to be a confirmed case of coronavirus in the county. All but one of the moves was approved 8-0; Commissioner Ashley Trivette had a work conflict and could not attend.\n\nNorth Carolina has already been declared in a State of Emergency by Gov. Roy Cooper, and President Donald Trump had issued a declaration of national emergency. The county action enacts its Emergency Operations Plan, with mutual assistance compacts and agreements, and with protocol specific to Emergency Management, health and medical services departments of the county, and the Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nIt also is a designation that potentially could have financial implications, specifically from FEMA \u2014 the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nDr. Terri Duncan and Nathan Dowless briefed commissioners at the outset. She\u2019s the director of the Health Department and he\u2019s the director of Emergency Management. Commissioners peppered them with questions and each was answered.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of rumors going around in the county,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cI ask you to remember to instill in people fact not fear.\u201d\n\nShe said 12 people have been tested, and that includes tests of Bladen residents conducted in four other counties. There\u2019s a four- to eight-day wait to get results, Duncan said.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your support to this point,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going in the next hour, but we are resilient people. We\u2019ll make decisions on the current guidelines we have.\u201d\n\nCommissioners and the two directors emphasized how rapidly conditions change, including by the hour.\n\nDowless said there is a nationwide shortage of masks, isolation gowns and thermometers. He also pointed out a crucial fact for the county receiving assistance, such as when a hurricane hits. Usually there is help from other parts of the state and even the country; in this case, he said, \u201cEverybody is experiencing this.\u201d\n\nHe said 84 of 100 counties in the state had declared a State of Emergency; that list grew by at least one at the same time as Bladen acted when New Hanover County declared about 5 p.m.\n\nTwo forms of compassionate help are probable from Duke Energy and Star Communications. About $2,500 in gift cards from Duke is likely to be spread around the county, and seven to nine WiFi temporary hotspots are going to be established by Star to help students doing online learning while schools are closed. Star is also putting similar spots in Sampson County, where its headquarters are located.\n\nMore details on each will be forthcoming soon; Star may put the hotspots in as soon as Monday.\n\nThe county took action to suspend public access to all county buildings with the exception of the courthouse. It joins multiple Bladen municipalities that have already done so to include Elizabethtown, White Lake and Clarkton.\n\nThe panel passed policies titled \u201cCOVID-19 Temporary Teleworking Policy\u201d and \u201cCOVID-19 Temporary Advanced Sick Leave Policy.\u201d There was considerable discussion on each, with the work from home principle passing 8-0 and the sick leave action gaining approval 5-3.\n\nChairman Ray Britt, Vice Chairman David Gooden, Charles Ray Peterson, Daniel Dowless and Russell Priest were in favor, and Dr. Ophelia Munn-Goins, Michael Cogdell and Arthur Bullock were against.\n\nThose opposed rejected the last line: \u201cFollowing the exhaustion of advanced sick leave an employee may apply for leave without pay as provided in the Bladen County Personnel Policy.\u201d The trio wanted it amended in some manner to say the county would revisit the situation if this happens because of the virus.\n\nThe voices of Britt and Peterson and the head-nods of others voting both in favor and against confirmed that the panel has every intention to, as more than one voice on opposite sides of the vote was heard to say, \u201ctake care of employees.\u201d\n\nThe policy enables employees \u2014 and County Manager Greg Martin confirmed several dozen are new and without much accrued sick and vacation leave \u2014 to apply for advanced sick leave. There are five requirements.\n\nThe teleworking policy could potentially keep many county employees working. Its purpose is \u201cto provide a means to continue necessary County business during a situation as authorized by the County Manager.\u201d\n\nIn pushing back tax listings, Britt said he wanted to spare county residents making difficult financial choices as the virus ascends to its peak. Normally, the Bladen Journal publishes those listings before March 31. The new date must come before June 1, meaning latest publication would be Friday, May 29.\n\nThe board\u2019s other action was to cancel meeting Monday, when a 5 p.m. special meeting was to address the fiscal budget for 2020-21 and a regular meeting was set for 6:30 p.m.\n\nThe board may meet in emergency session as the virus pandemic dictates; otherwise, the next scheduled regular meeting is April 6.\n\nAlan Wooten | Bladen Journal\n\nCommissioners and the two dozen in attendance were in accordance with social distancing at Friday\u2019s emergency meeting.

He signed the declaration at the county's 2:30 p.m. media briefing on behalf of the entire board.\n\n\"I do have the authority to do it as commission chair,\" Newman told the Citizen Times that morning. \"I think we just want to be sending the message to the community that this is a very important health concern, there are definite things that individuals, businesses, local governments can do to reduce the risk of the spread of it.\n\n\"We want people to be taking all those reasonable steps now. We don't want to send the message that it's not something people should be very conscious of going forward.\"\n\nBuy Photo Brownie Newman at an event in January 2017. (Photo: Angela Wilhelm\/awilhelm@citizen-times.com)\n\nThe declaration makes Buncombe eligible for state and federal resources that may be made available to communities to address the coronavirus, according to Newman. It enables all units of government in Buncombe too work together in the response.\n\nCommissioners still to vote on virus-related budget amendment\n\nCounty management proposed the declaration of a local state of emergency \"to ensure that COVID-19 remains controlled and that residents and visitors in Buncombe County remain safe and secure,\" a county memo states.\n\nMore on the local COVID-19 response:\n\nCounty staff also suggested a budget amendment that would allow the county to allocate $250,000 from its fund balance for public health and human services costs \"in the event of necessary expenditures.\"\n\nNewman said commissioners will vote on the amendment March 17.\n\nCOVID-19: A global pandemic, tests out from WNC\n\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic March 11, as the WHO director general announced more than 100,000 cases of the respiratory illness in over 100 countries.

During the county's media briefing, medical director Dr. Jennifer Mullendore said there are COVID-19 tests from WNC pending, but none had been returned with a presumed positive result.\n\nStatewide, a total of 14 people had tested positive for COVID-19 as of that afternoon, according to a release from the Department of Health and Human Services and announcements from the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department.\n\nFour of the five recently identified cases are a Forsyth County couple, a Johnston County resident and a Durham resident who tested positive in another state, the release said.\n\nThe fifth and sixth cases are in Mecklenburg County, according to the County's Department of Public Health.\n\nRecommendations from officials\n\nDr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C.

I would recommend for all of our citizens to get their information from a trusted source, to include DHHS and the CDC (Centers for Disease Control).\u201d\n\nHe added that a limited number of North Carolina National Guard troops will be activated to help with logistics.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":14726.0}

It came as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 32 across the state, and four in nearby Mecklenburg County.\n\nChris Dobbins, director of the Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services, said no positive cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed here. But he warned against putting too much emphasis on that.\n\n\"That should not give anyone a false sense of security,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a very high probability that we have the virus in our community.\"\n\nAs part of the declaration, the county is restricting all public or social gatherings to 50 people or less. Gaston County Police Chief Joe Ramey said they will have the ability to charge and prosecute violators, though he urged residents to self-police for the good of the community.\n\nCourts in will remain open on a limited basis, as the majority of district and superior courts across the state will be closed for 30 days. Gaston County District Court Judge John Greenlee said two courtrooms will be running consistently during normal business hours to handle certain matters, and judges will be available, though jury trials that have yet to begin will be suspended for 30 days.\n\nAnyone with questions about the court schedule is advised to call 704-852-3100.\n\n\"This is unprecedented in the state of North Carolina, and certainly in Gaston County,\" Greenlee said.\n\nGov. Roy Cooper on Saturday ordered all K-12 public schools across the state to close for two weeks. Gaston County Schools Superintendent Jeff Booker said local officials are developing packets of information to send home with the roughly 31,000 students in the local system, so that learning can continue. He also unveiled a plan to provide meals for the 65 percent of the student population that receives some form of food assistance.\n\n\"We\u2019ve already begun a plan to activate our summer feeding program on Tuesday,\" he said.\n\n\u2018We must be proactive\u2019\n\nGaston County Commission Chairman Tracy Philbeck said the restriction on gatherings does not apply to licensed businesses, healthcare facilities, schools, government offices and daycares.\n\n\"Employers are encouraged to allow employees to work from home, stagger work schedules and implement in-person work space arrangements that optimize work space between employees,\" he said. \"The reason we have chosen to decrease the size of public and social gatherings is based on specific community needs. Based on the information from our health care officials and surveying critical public services, a spike in confirmed cases has the potential to put in jeopardy our ability to handle patients, and keep essential public services operating efficiently and effectively to address our community needs.\"\n\nPhilbeck said the declaration will allow the county to take advantage of possible state and federal funding and allow its operations center and municipalities to operate in an efficient fashion to address the coronavirus. He said the county is determined to stay ahead of the game in this situation.\n\n\"We cannot afford to wait and see what happens. That is not responsible leadership,\" he said. \"We must be proactive, and when we get through this crisis \u2013 and we will \u2013 I will be fine looking back and saying we did too much. I refuse to look back and say we did not do enough.\"\n\nDr. Todd Davis, chief medical officer of CaroMont Health, said the leadership team at CaroMont Regional Medical Center has been planning extensively since January for the possible arrival of the coronavirus. They have done that by collaborating with everyone from public health officials to paramedics.\n\n\"We have created a tiered response, allowing us to be able to react to the needs of the patient volume we potentially could have,\" he said. \"I\u2019m extremely confident our health care providers will show the type of professionalism and compassion you expect from them, and we will do everything to make sure our patients and our staff are safe.\"\n\n\u2018Social caring\u2019\n\nPeople who are young and healthy may not be as susceptible to COVID-19, but they can still be carriers of the virus who could spread it to people who are more at risk, such as older residents and people with weakened immune systems, Dobbins said.\n\n\"You may have heard the term \u2018social distancing\u2019 a lot in previous days,\" he said. \"What I would like you to think about is another term: \u2018social caring.\u2019 Because that\u2019s where we are going to need this community to go moving forward. We\u2019ve got the expertise, we\u2019ve got the resources, we\u2019ve got the support. Now is an opportunity for us to help each other.\"\n\nPhilbeck encouraged residents to stay away from crowds, practice proper hygiene and call before attending any type of function. That will help to protect people in the community who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, including senior citizens, those already under a doctor\u2019s care, those with underlying health issues, and health care workers, he said.\n\nRather than asking churches to close, Philbeck said they are requesting that they keep gatherings to 50 people or less, possibly by holding multiple services throughout the day. Not taking the county\u2019s recommendations seriously could have horrible effects, he said.\n\n\"If we have a small spike in coronavirus cases in Gaston County, I\u2019m thinking 10 or 15, it could literally put our jail in jeopardy, our hospital in jeopardy, and our health and human services.\n\n\"We could literally have to decide who gets a respirator and who doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s that serious.\"\n\nDobbins said they do not yet have the ability to test \"anybody and everybody\" who wants to know if they have the virus. But people who have questions or concerns are being urged to call the county\u2019s community hotline, at 704-862-5303. It\u2019s operational from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays.\n\n\"We do anticipate the calls are going to increase and we are looking at expanding those hours,\" he said.\n\nPlan for the court system\n\nThe state constitution mandates that courts must remain open at all times. But North Carolina Chief Justice Cheri Beasley\u2019s decision on Friday to issue an emergency declaration for courts across the state means that they will only be open on a limited basis for the next 30 days, Greenlee said.\n\n\"There are some things we cannot continue for 30 days,\" he said.\n\nOne courtroom at the local courthouse will operate normally and handle things such as domestic violence protective orders, no contact\/harassment\/stalking orders, and allow inmates to have their bonds reviewed and make first appearances. A second courtroom will be open to handle all other emergency matters, and fulfill the constitution by allowing for due process, Greenlee said.\n\nJury trials will be suspended for 30 days, though a sole jury trial that is currently in panel in Gaston County will continue, possibly being wrapped up by early next week, Greenlee said. The grand jury has also been suspended.\n\nThe Gaston County Courthouse will remain open, and the clerks\u2019 office will continue to accept filings. But Greenlee said residents should only come there if they absolutely have to.\n\n\"I ask all citizens who have cases scheduled in district court over the next 30 days, up until April 16, do not come to the courthouse to come to your court date,\" he said. \"Between the clerk\u2019s office and the DA\u2019s office, there will a concerted effort next week to get court dates on every case that\u2019s scheduled for the next 30 days. That\u2019s thousands.\"\n\nAnyone with a domestic violence protective order should come to court as scheduled, Greenlee said. But most other residents should wait to get a notice in the next 10 days regarding when their court date has been rescheduled.\n\n\"If you have a civil or domestic case, contact your attorney or the clerk\u2019s office and they\u2019ll give you the procedure on how to get a new court date set,\" he said.\n\nSchool system response\n\nBooker said the governor\u2019s decision to close schools for two weeks will have \"a drastic impact on Gaston County.\" He thanked students, parents and employees for their patience and understanding to this point.\n\nStaff have been told to report for a teacher workday on Monday, where more will be discussed about the week and month ahead.\n\nBooker said information will be disseminated to parents and employees in the same way that it is done for inclement weather, and the school system\u2019s website will be updated continuously.\n\n\"For our students, we are developing packets of information we can give you so that learning can go on,\" he said. \"But let me stress that nothing can replace the value of our highly qualified teachers. We will do the best, and we will work to make things available, recognizing that 65 percent of our population receives some form of assistance with food.\"\n\nBooker said they have selected 10 sites that they plan to use as distribution points in activating the summer feeding program Tuesday. More details were being worked out on that plan Sunday afternoon, but he emphasized plans could change quickly.\n\n\"The governor may come out with a different plan,\" he said. \"Things are evolving and as the state empowers and asks us to do things, we will respond.\"\n\nBooker said they have been talking with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and internet providers about the potential for some type of online learning.\n\n\"What we know is that we do not have unlimited internet availability for 31,000 of our students,\" he said. \"That is the purpose of introducing learning packets, so we can utilize them in the interim. Measures are being taken to talk to some of the major providers about providing free access, but that will take some time.\"\n\nYou can reach Michael Barrett at 704-869-1826 or mbarrett@gastongazette.com.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":209420.0}

The more people adhere to these guidelines, the sooner the coronavirus threat will pass.\u201d\n\nPenny also tried to reassure residents not to panic as the number of cases, which has grown to four as of Tuesday morning, in Harnett County rise. He said despite the measures currently in place to reduce the risk, the chances are there will be more positive tests.\n\n\u201cEven with these measures in place, it is reasonable to anticipate that Harnett County will see additional positive tests,\u201d Penny said. \u201cThis should not be cause for panic. The health and well-being of our citizens is the top priority of the Harnett County Board of Commissioners and county staff.\u201d\n\nBenson\n\nIn addition to Harnett County\u2019s declaration, the town board of commissioners of Benson also issued a declaration during a special session Monday night.\n\nBenson Media Coordinator Tyler Douglas said the move will allow the town manager and police chief to implement certain actions.\n\n\u201cThis will also allow the town manager and the police chief to augment building access, implement safety measures, and institute a curfew if necessary in relation to keeping staff and residents safe from the spread of the virus,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cCurrently, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 in Benson, but due to reports of the virus in neighboring areas, Benson commissioners felt compelled to take every available measure to ensure the safety of town employees and residents.\u201d\n\nAt the present time, the Benson Town Hall remains open and operating under normal business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. However, the majority of the building is closed to the public.

Godwin said the declaration is necessary to position the county to receive needed aid from state and federal resources.\n\n\u201cI have today initiated a proclamation for a state of emergency in Johnston County primarily because of procedural and logistical requirements for expedited assistance from state and federal agencies,\u201d Godwin said in the statement. \u201cOur team feels that this declaration will strategically position our local emergency management personnel to receive necessary equipment and supplies more quickly.\u201d\n\nThere are currently two cases of COVID-19 in Johnston County, according to county officials.

These establishments include nursing homes, independent and assisted living facilities, correctional facilities, and facilities that care for medically vulnerable children.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services recommends that event organizers urge anyone who is sick to not attend, encourage people who are at high risk to not attend, adopt lenient refund policies for people who are high risk, find ways to give people more physical space so as to limit close contact as much as possible, encourage attendees to wash hands frequently, and to clean surfaces with standard cleaners.\n\nAll travelers returning from countries and U.S. states affected by COVID-19 are urged to follow Department of Health and Human Services guidance on self-monitoring: https:\/\/www.ncdhhs.gov\/divisions\/public-health\/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina\/coronavirus.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services is not recommending the pre-emptive closure of schools and childcare centers at this time.\n\nThe recommendations should begin immediately and extend through March 31, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nSmith favors the recommendations because they, for the most part, are designed to protect the vulnerable, older population.\n\n\u201cIt also recognizes that a person coming from a state, say Washington, may be as much of a risk as Italy, Japan or such,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a special emphasis on restricting visitors around facility-bound individuals which is keeping with restrictions put in place at the height of the flu season.\n\n\u201cIt should be noted that industries, county and city governments, school boards or any employer can be more restrictive than state guidelines.\u201d\n\nThe CDC reported Tuesday there are more than 110,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide. There are 647 cases in the United States and there have been 25 deaths, according to the CDC. Cases have been confirmed in 35 states and in Washington, D.C.\n\nA North Carolina Division of Public Health report issued Tuesday put the number of global cases at 113,702 and the number deaths around the world at 4,012.\n\nDebate rages among health officials, physicians and researchers about how contagious and deadly the new coronavirus is. Most say this is because too little is known about the disease that came out of Wuhan, China, and was first reported to the World Health Organization in late December.\n\nIn particular, estimates of the virus\u2019 mortality rate vary widely. The World Health Organization reported Friday the mortality rate could be between 3% and 4%. The same WHO report said that estimate was based on the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases.\n\nSome researchers, in particular a group in the United Kingdom, say the morality rate could be 2% or lower because some cases, particularly mild cases, are not reported. Some researchers believe between five and 40 coronavirus cases in 1,000 will result in death, with a best guess of nine in 1,000, or about 1%.\n\nSome researchers and public health officials agree that death from COVID-19 will depend greatly on the infected person\u2019s age, sex, general health and the health system available to the person.\n\nCooper https:\/\/www.robesonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/web1_Roy-Cooper-1.jpg Cooper Smith https:\/\/www.robesonian.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/web1_Smith-bill-3.jpg Smith\n\nT.C.

The county is one of the North Carolina counties without a confirmed case of the coronavirus. The county manager said the state of emergency doesn't mean travel will be restricted in or out of the county. The state of emergency basically gives any town in the county more power to receive more resources and be reimbursed later from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Some examples would be fuel or items in the home you might need. \"It\u2019s not a typical situation. I don\u2019t have a playbook for this. We\u2019ve had to be patient in what we do when making decisions and we\u2019ve had to change those decisions on the fly,\" County Manager, Chris Knopf said.The Surry County Health Department is now monitoring the latest updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as this situation evolves. Samantha Ange, the county health director, said there is so much false information online right now. She wants people to know that North Carolina Health and Human Services and the CDC have updates daily. \"I think that going through a pandemic will definitely stay in all of our minds throughout our lifetime. But if we do, we know how to better react. I think we'll tell our children about this one day,\" Ange said. While Surry County has no confirmed cases now, leaders are trying to learn from other counties or towns to figure out the best move to make next.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":73050.0}

It is important to understand what that means and, just as importantly, what that doesn't mean.\n\nA State of Emergency is a tool which gives government some flexibility in responding to unusual circumstances. I believe this is merited in our current COVID-19 response execution, due to the complexity of the response planning which is taking place.\n\nIn declaring a State of Emergency, Transylvania County joins 67 other North Carolina counties, along with the Federal and State governments. All those entities decided this action was a prudent part of their COVID-19 response planning.\n\nThis action is also coming with the assent of the City of Brevard and town of Rosman.\n\nThese are important points to understand. There is no reason for additional concern on behalf of our citizens. This is a case of adding an additional tool in our toolbox, should it be needed.\n\nOn behalf of the Transylvania County Board of Commissioners and the dedicated staff of Transylvania County government, thank you for your response to this challenge.

Mecklenburg County, the state's largest county, already has its own supplemental restrictions. The state counted 66 positive cases in Mecklenburg.\n\nWhile Gov. Roy Cooper's current executive order makes gatherings of more than 100 people a criminal violation, state health officials have urged residents to comply with lower thresholds. Cooper also has prohibited dining-in at restaurants and bars.\n\nPlayground equipment in public and private parks in Wake County can't be used, according to the county's emergency order, which also recommends retailers screen employees and customers for illness before they enter.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nThe number of completed tests in North Carolina at public and private labs, now over 6,400, has doubled since Friday.

The declaration comes after Jamestown Mayor Dwaine Heinrich issued an emergency declaration during a special City Council meeting on Monday, Oct. 14.\n\n\"There are potential agricultural impacts but there are also other impacts that could affect both the county and the city of LaMoure,\" said Kimberly Robbins, LaMoure County emergency manager. \"The best case scenario, the releases decrease. The worst case scenario, we see again what we went through last spring.\"\n\nWater levels of the James River in the city of LaMoure were at 15.9 feet on April 4 of this year due to ice jams and high tributary flows.\n\nAs of 1:15 p.m. on Oct. 15, the gauge of the James River in the city of LaMoure was 11.8 feet. According to the LaMoure County website, the average level is 7 to 8 feet, with the action stage being at 12 feet. Flood stage is 14 feet, a moderate flood stage is 16 feet and a major flood stage is 18 feet.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is releasing 1,000 cubic feet per second from Jamestown Dam and 800 cfs from Pipestem Dam as of Monday for a combined flow of 1,800 cfs, said Jerry Bergquist, Stutsman County emergency manager.\n\nlisten live watch live\n\nBergquist said the 1,800 cfs being released from the two dams is the highest it has been since 2011, when releases were a combined 2,400 cfs.\n\nRobbins said it takes between five and seven days for water released from Pipestem and Jamestown dams to reach LaMoure. Bergquist said since mid-September, Pipestem and Jamestown reservoirs have experienced a high volume of water in both river systems from high precipitation.\n\n\"I don't know if I have any (expectations) yet,\" Bergquist said. \"Based on everything we know now it isn't anything different than what we knew about it yesterday.\"\n\nA public information meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at City Hall in Jamestown, where representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Weather Service, city of Jamestown and Stutsman County Emergency Management are among those expected to attend.\n\nBergquist said the meeting could reveal what the next step for both counties is.\n\n\"We\u2019re putting together a plan to do some minimal sandbagging in some parts of town where we know elevation is low,\" Bergquist said. \"If we don\u2019t end up using the (sandbagging) operation that would be the best news in the world, but we\u2019d at least be prepared for it if we did need to use it.\u201d\n\nRobbins said LaMoure County will be installing a new gauge in the river to measure the flow and elevation of the water. The gauge will be near Adrian, about 30 miles northwest of the city of LaMoure, where a second gauge is located.\n\n\"The county website is being updated with flood information constantly,\" Robbins said. \"Hopefully our residents will be informed of what flood stages we will be entering going forward.\"\n\nBergquist said time is going to be very valuable moving forward.\n\n\u201cWe're trying to be as proactive as we can,\" Berquist said. \"We know they're going to want to release as much water as possible before the freeze-up.\u201d\n\n\n\nBergquist also said saturated soils combining with no frost on the ground could be a potential problem for people living close to the river.\n\n\"People that are close to the river may be experiencing higher water tables,\" Bergquist said. \"Some (sump) pumps might be kicking in and starting to work, but others might not. There's no better time to check your sump pumps.\"\n\nSump pumps are commonly found in basements where homes are at or below the water table and work to pump groundwater outside of the home automatically, Bergquist said. If the water level is high enough and the pumps aren't working, people can start to see flooding in their basement.\n\n\"Seriously, it is a great time to check your pumps,\" Bergquist said. \"It is a very wise thing to do just to check and make sure.\"\n\nBergquist said LaMoure may be the only town \"highly impacted\" by unregulated tributaries adding to the two rivers flowing south from Jamestown.\n\n\"LaMoure is affected more than anywhere,\" Bergquist said. \"There could easily be homes along the river where the water might be getting closer. I don't know of any hot spots in particular except for the city of LaMoure.\"\n\nBergquist said northern parts of South Dakota could see increases in water levels up until the James River connects with the Missouri River.\n\n\"When you get into South Dakota, there gets to be a lot of issues there as well,\" Bergquist said. \"The river has a tendency to spread out quite a bit. Maybe even a half mile or more.\"\n\nThe public information meeting will begin at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 16 at City Hall, 102 3rd Ave. SE, in Jamestown.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":4166.0}

Those who had business to conduct with the board waited in a conference room with a video feed and came into the session individually to speak.\n\n\u201cExtraordinary times require extraordinary action,\u201d said David Painter, president of the Board of County Commissioners. Commissioners Ed Humphrey and Claire Corcoran concurred.\n\nThe emergency declaration, along with a previous resolution delegating disaster functions in event of an absence of a quorum of the Board, spells out succession of leadership and the authority of the County Administrator in an emergency. It exempts from the competitive bidding process purchases related to the emergency that are greater than $50,000 but less than $100,000, so long as no fewer than three informal estimates are obtained.\n\nThe County Administrator is authorized to \u201ctake those actions that are necessary and appropriate, including the delegation of administrative and departmental functions among \u201cresponsible staff\u201d to assure proper implementation in exercising this authority,\u201d the resolution states. The County Administrator also will \u201creport to the Board of Commissioners on any actions taken pursuant to this resolution.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the emergency declaration, the Commissioners suspended Monday meetings (except March 23) into the future as well as suspended public participation.\n\nIn the absence of a quorum of the County Commissioners, authority is designated to the County Administrator. In the absence of the County Administrator, the President of the Board may delegate to the Assistant County Administrator or Budget Director.\n\nThe resolution also activates the Clermont County Emergency Operations Center for the duration of the emergency in order to coordinate response efforts.\n\nPam Haverkos, the county\u2019s Emergency Management Agency director, said the declaration would allow the county to obtain state funds in the future if needed.\n\nIn addition to the emergency declaration, the Commissioners suspended Monday meetings (except March 23) into the future as well as suspended public participation.\n\n\u201cThrough the leadership of Clermont County Public Health and the Clermont County Emergency Management Agency, we\u2019re collaborating with first responders, hospitals, the business community and others to navigate these challenging times,\u201d Painter said. \u201cOur goal is to protect the health of our employees and those they serve. We seek to slow the spread of this highly contagious disease, while continuing to carry forth the essential operations of government.\u201d\n\nFull statement by Commissioner Painter: Extraordinary times require extraordinary actions. I commend each and every one of you for the steps you have taken during this challenging time. It\u2019s inspiring to see people coming together and following the advice of health experts so we don\u2019t overwhelm our health system. People are practicing \u201csocial distancing,\u201d as recommended by the experts, so they don\u2019t get infected by this highly contagious disease and pass it on to the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. You\u2019re checking on each other and supporting each other. You\u2019re doing what it takes. You\u2019ve taken steps to protect the public and our employees. I see resilient and innovative people rallying and doing their best at a challenging time. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Clermont County government has made a number of changes in delivery of services. Some of the actions include closing waiting rooms, delaying court hearings, providing services online and getting payments via drop boxes and mail. We are in constant contact with our department heads and elected officials and will provide updates as they become available. We\u2019re continually updating the list, available at www.clermontcountyohio.gov. The list includes specifics about what waiting rooms are closed and alternative ways of doing business with Clermont County government. You\u2019ll see a number of online opportunities for applying for services and new ways to mail or drop off documents. These moves were taken in response to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization, the Ohio Department of Health and our own Clermont County Public Health. Through the leadership of Clermont County Public Health and the Clermont County Emergency Management Agency, we\u2019re collaborating with first responders, hospitals, the business community and others to navigate these challenging times. Our goal is to protect the health of our employees and those they serve. We seek to slow the spread of this highly contagious disease, while continuing to carry forth the essential operations of government. If history concludes that we have defaulted to a position of increased safety that wasn\u2019t warranted, we can live with that. One thing we can\u2019t live with is knowing that we didn\u2019t act when we had the chance and that lack of action resulted in you or your family being hurt. This is a difficult for everyone. Please be patient and understand that everyone here at Clermont County has your safety at heart even when some decisions might make life difficult for a short duration. If you can, limit your social distance from others, protect your children, wash your hands, keep your hands below your face when possible, and help others that need your help. Together we have weathered storms, droughts, floods, tornadoes, power losses, and we will rise to this challenge and overcome. We are Clermont County. May God bless you and your families.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":200218.0}

Howell said the county knows how to work well together.\n\n\u201cNo one is immune,\u201d Howell said. \u201cFor individuals with no symptoms, there would be no test needed. For individuals with mild cold-like symptoms no test would be needed. Individuals with severe illness cough, shortness of breath and fever may be tested.\u201d\n\nHowell said county preparations began when the first reports of the virus came from China.\n\nWarren County commissioners Dave Young and Tom Grossmann voted no, while insisting they were ready to provide more funding to fire and emergency management workers needing equipment when dealing with potential cases.\n\nGrossmann and Young suggested declaring the emergency would cause residents to panic. They noted federal and state states of emergency had already been declared.\n\nBruce McGary, the county prosecutor advising them, indicated he had found no legal basis for the need for the county declaration.\n\nCommissioner Shannon Jones said the vote on a resolution sought by local emergency management and health officials was advisable and unlikely to create additional panic in the county.\n\nDuring a 90-minute work session, the commissioners heard appeals from a handful of emergency management officials to declare the emergency to support a change in standard of care to eliminate the transport of residents to be tested for COVID-19 with no other medical problem.\n\nRELATED: Montgomery County to declare emergency: What it means\n\nThe officials also said the emergency declaration would also put the county emergency response agencies in line to get more masks and other equipment needed to respond to calls.\n\n\u201cNo one is saying this isn\u2019t serious,\u201d Young said. \u201cWhen we declare a state of emergency, that means something.\u201d\n\nYoung and Grossmann emphasized they want to support needed changes, once the legal support has been provided.\n\nDuring the meeting, Franklin Fire Chief Jonathan Westendorf said Atrium Medical Center in Warren County dealt with a a COVID-19 case last week.\n\n\u201cAtrium Medical Center and other Premier Health hospitals currently have no admitted patients with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Late last week, a person came to Atrium Medical Center to be tested for COVID-19. This person returned home and went into self-quarantine. We have learned that this person did test positive for the virus. The patient is recovering at home. Staff took appropriate precautions as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention when testing this person, and therefore CDC guidelines do not recommend that the staff be isolated or quarantined,\u201d according to a statement issued by Jennifer Burcham, site manager, PR and Community Relations, at Atrium.\n\nCoronavirus: DeWine asks for voting to be extended to June 2\n\nThank you for reading the Dayton Daily News and for supporting local journalism.

As early as the 1950s, the same orders were used to help guide the decision making when isolating or quarantining someone with a communal disease like typhoid or tuberculosis.\n\nHow to get expert answers to your coronavirus questions\n\nAlthough no one in Greene County has tested positive for coronavirus, Howell explained the orders might need to be enforced if an individual who had coronavirus, or came in contact with someone who had it, refused to voluntarily comply to isolation or quarantine.\n\n\u201cOnce they go home, we ask them and the hospitals ask them, to keep themselves at home if they\u2019re in that time period where they could still spread the illness,\u201d Howell said. \u201cBut if that person chose not to stay at home, then we could issue those isolation orders. If it were someone who was exposed to a case, then that would be where we would issue quarantine orders.\u201d\n\nMost people follow the orders voluntarily, however if necessary, the board could appoint a person to enforce the orders.\n\nWhite House steps up safeguards as Trump awaits test results\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement already has the authority to act based on Dr. Acton\u2019s orders if they believe somebody is spreading illness around,\u201d Howell said. But typically we would just perhaps deputize our own sanitarian, or just a person to watch and make sure someone is staying in isolation and quarantine during the time where they might be transmitting disease or going into the community.\u201d\n\nAlthough the policies on how to handle individuals in isolation and quarantine are decided on by the board are all adopted at a local level, Howell said she expects other surrounding counties to have similar plans.\n\n\u201cWhen we are developing them, we develop them together lots of times so you\u2019re going to see very similar actions taken everywhere,\u201d Howell said.\n\nThe board considers the county\u2019s risk as still relatively low.\n\nCoronavirus: 26 cases confirmed in Ohio, officials discuss mental health amid pandemic\n\n\u201cWe believe the risk is low,\u201d Howell said. \u201cSo far we have no cases, anyone that\u2019s been tested from Greene County, as we speak right now, has tested negative. But those numbers are rapidly changing and we believe that there is community spread so it\u2019s just a matter of time before we get our first case.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s meeting was held as Governor Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton held a press conference to discuss updates on the coronavirus and share the state\u2019s response to the virus.\n\nThere are now 26 cases in Ohio and 264 people are under investigation for coronavirus the Ohio Department of Health reported.\n\nThank you for reading the Dayton Daily News and for supporting local journalism.

(Photo: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)\n\nThe county's state of emergency doesn't give commissioners power to cancel events, said spokeswoman Bridget Doherty.\n\nBut it does allow the county to get reimbursement from the federal government on any expenses related to the pandemic. It also allows the county to make purchases without having to go through competitive bidding.\n\nFor instance, if the company that provides food to the jail can no longer due so due to coronavirus, the county can find another food vendor without having to bid it out, she said.\n\nThe declaration also gives commissioners the power to establish the joint information center, which would serve as a base of operations for emergency responders, if that becomes necessary.\n\nAs of now, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hamilton County.

But for the elderly and people with immune deficiencies, the disease can kill.\n\nKesterman asked anyone who is feeling ill to stay home, no matter how minor the symptoms.\n\n\"Even if you think you have the cold, now is the time to take that precaution,\" Kesterman said. \"We don't want you to make other people sick.\"\n\nKesterman said the state and county have enough COVID-19 tests to meet demand. There have been 82 tests for COVID-19 statewide with enough tests available now for 600-800 people.\n\nHe recommended anyone who suspects they have COVID-19 to contact their primary care physician or, if they don't have a primary care physician, an urgent care facility. He said to contact them first by phone so the medical staff can prepare and safely test without risking getting anyone ill.\n\nThe physician will then order a test if needed, he said. The samples are sent to a state lab for testing.\n\nCounty officials urged the public not to panic. Hamilton County Emergency Management Director Nick Crossley said they're asking people to have two weeks worth of food, medicine and water and not gather in large groups.\n\n\"It's all pre-emptive,\" Crossley said. \"We can show you the research that if we don't these large gatherings, we can contain this.

Here is how to do it and how it can help curb the COVID-19 pandemic. USA TODAY\n\nMARION \u2014 A statewide ban on mass gatherings due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has forced the cancellation and postponement of thousands of events across Ohio.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency because of the pandemic and said he will make $50 billion available to fight the outbreak.\n\nAs of press time Friday, there were 13 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Ohio, according to the ODH website. ODH reports that 159 people are under investigation and 333 people are under health supervision.\n\nMarion Health Commissioner Traci Kinsler said Friday afternoon that there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Marion County. She said Marion Public Health continues to monitor the situation locally.\n\nProfessional, college, and high school athletic events, school plays and music competitions, concerts, job fairs, and a wide range of other activities have been canceled in the wake of the order, which prohibits gatherings of 100 or more people in the same indoor space.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Health (ODH) Director Dr. Amy Acton issued the order during a press conference held Thursday in Columbus.\n\nLike all other communities across the state, Marion County is experiencing the effects of the temporary ban.\n\nCity of Marion response\n\nThe City of Marion announced in a press release Friday afternoon that the Marion Senior Center will be closed \"effective immediately until April 13.\"\n\n\"The Senior Center Transportation, Homemaker services, and Lifecare Alliance Home Meal delivery will operate as normal until further notice,\" the release reads. \"The monthly Food Box distribution will continue as usual, but the pickup\/distribution point will be located outdoors at the Senior Center.\"\n\nMarion Area Transit will remain open for \"normal business,\" according to the press release. Officials said there could be delays in service due to city workers disinfecting the buses throughout the day.\n\nMayor Scott Schertzer has recommended that all meetings of boards and commissions under his appointment be canceled until April 13. Additionally, city employees are being encouraged to limit face-to-face meetings and \"employee travel to non-essential conferences and\/or meetings outside the City of Marion will not be permitted through April 13.\"\n\nAccording to the press release, \"City buildings have had high-touch points disinfected with remaining areas set for disinfection in the coming days. Disinfection will continue on an on-going basis following protocols that are in place.\"\n\nColiseum events canceled\n\nAccording to a post on the Marion County Fair's Facebook page, all events scheduled at Veterans Memorial Coliseum have been canceled.\n\nThe post reads, \"Due to the governor's order regarding the COVID-19 virus, events at the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum are cancelled until further notice. Stay safe and healthy! We'll see you when this all clears.\"\n\nDirector Cindy Wood was not available for comment on Friday.\n\nEvents lost due to the governor's order include this weekend's VEX Robotics State Championship for elementary and middle school students; the OH-WAY Wrestling tournaments planned for March 20-22 and March 27-28; the National Robotics Challenge set for April 2-4; and the Champion Force Athletics Cheerleading Challenge scheduled for April 25.\n\n\"The thing we're worrying about is the loss of revenue to our local businesses and how this might impact our community,\" said Matt Carbary, president of the Marion Area Chamber of Commerce. \"It's a combination of understanding the need to keep our community safe and how we can support our local businesses.\"\n\nMark Holbrook, executive director of the Marion Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, said local hotels and restaurants will experience a negative impact due to the cancellations.\n\n\"The main priority is safety and health, but the health of our community also depends on a thriving economy,\" he said. \"When we have things that impact it, we have to take a look at how we're going to react and deal with the situation. The hotels are going to be hit the hardest, because they don't only rely on visitors to Marion, but also on stop-overs for people who are traveling. Being on a major route, we have a lot of stop-over traffic, but that's going to be reduced as well.\"\n\nPalace Theatre schedule altered\n\nPalace Theatre Executive Director Bev Ford said the governor's temporary ban on mass gatherings has caused the cancellation or postponement of several events at the downtown venue.\n\nPleasant High School and Elgin High School have both postponed their spring musicals. Ford said she is working with both schools to reschedule the plays. Pleasant's production of \"Mary Poppins: The Broadway Musical\" was planned for this weekend. Elgin's performance of \"Into the Woods\" was scheduled for the weekend of March 20-22.\n\n\"In addition to the schools, we have seen a number of other organizations also cancel rental events,\" Ford said. \"Because March is historically high school rentals, the Palace doesn't program our own events; therefore, there are no theater sponsored events that are being impacted over the next couple of weeks. Our classes, through the Academy of the Arts, will continue because enrollment is well under the 100 person mass meeting limit, and we are fortunately able to provide the recommended six feet (of) spacing for participants.\"\n\nFord said theater officials will continue to monitor orders from the governor's office and ODH. She said the upcoming Palace schedule includes a film to be shown March 27-29, the stage production of \"Nunsense II: The Second Act\" on April 3-4, and a concert with pop singer Amy Grant on April 18.\n\n\"We are holding steady and will respond accordingly once we know how this unfolds,\" Ford said.\n\nFord said the theater is adjusting its box office hours due to the rental cancellations. For the next two weeks, the box office will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, but will be closed Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n\nShe said tickets for upcoming shows can still be purchased via the theater website marionpalace.org.\n\nYMCA is open, limits services\n\nMarion Family YMCA Executive Director Theresa Lubke said the facility will remain open to the public, but is canceling all classes and programs effective Saturday, March 14 through Saturday, March 31.\n\nChild Watch and Y Preschool are included in the cancellation notice. The sauna and steam rooms will also be closed.\n\nAccording to letter from Lubke, guest passes will not be sold or accepted for entry and guests will not be allowed to use the facility March 14-31. Members will not be allowed to bring guests.\n\nLubke noted that YMCA staff is \"taking steps to keep our facility as clean as possible.\"\n\n\"These steps include adding custodial hours, prioritizing cleaning time to disinfecting commonly used surfaces, keeping some doors open reducing need to touch door handles, additional cleaning of exercise equipment, and more frequent disinfecting of our Kids Gym and other areas of the facility,\" she stated. \"In addition, we have added hand sanitizer stations and are reminding our members through signage and email to stay home when sick, to clean fitness equipment after use, and to cover coughs and sneezes.\n\n\"We also encourage everyone to make a personal decision with their health care provider about taking the risk of exposure that exists when visiting a public setting.

Dr. Jack Butterfield says this is not a time to panic but there are precautions people can make.\n\n\u201cThere is now a fourth case of Coronavirus in Ohio. The significance of this case is it was a community spread infection. Which means this is a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a patient who has no travel history and no known exposure to another patient with COVID-19. So, that means in Ohio it is spreading in the community. We knew this was coming, today is the day that it has arrived. That also makes it a game changing day because of community spread, We have to give much more attention to the potential for this disease to spread in what we call mass gatherings,\u201d Butterfield said.\n\nDr. Butterfield says the Health Department has advised the Muskingum County Center for Seniors regarding the virus.\n\nExecutive Director Anna Combs for the Muskingum County Center for Seniors is cancelling all activities at their three locations until further notice starting Thursday.

Mike DeWine, Portage County was not among the 28 counties impacted by the illness. A total of 169 individuals had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with 39 of those people hospitalized. The disease has claimed the life of a patient from Lucas County.\n\n\n\nDeWine proclaimed a state of emergency on March 9.\n\n\n\nThe proclamation was approved as commissioners live-streamed Thursday\u2019s meeting for the first time, asking the public to stay away. Those who attended were given information on how to find the internet broadcast, and the start of the meeting was delayed by an hour so residents could go home and access the meeting online. The live-steam link for commissioners\u2019 meetings is available on the commissioner\u2019s page at the county website, www.co.portage.oh.us.\n\n\n\nPortage County Commissioner Sabrina Christian-Bennett voted against temporarily changing the format of the meetings during the outbreak. She said Brian Ames, who records commissioners meetings and streams them on YouTube, was upset about being excluded from the meeting, and that not enough notice of Thursday\u2019s change was given.\n\n\n\n\"I was not part of this decision,\" she said.\n\n\n\nAssistant Prosecutor Chris Meduri told commissioners that although meetings must be open to the public, Ohio\u2019s law on public meetings does not require the public to be able to speak at those meetings.\n\n\n\nCommissioners later discussed the possibility of eventually closing the administration building to the public, and urged department heads to work from home and have their employees do the same. Some said they still had to work from county buildings, but were limiting the number of people who came to the office. For now, the building remains open to the public, but people are being asked to do as much business as possible by phone or email.\n\n\n\nCommissioner Kathleen Clyde mentioned the possibility of conducting meetings via video conferencing, which would allow elected officials to stay home, while still providing a broadcast of the meeting to the public.\n\n\n\n\"I think in light of this crisis, we need to do what we can to protect the public and ourselves,\" she said.\n\n\n\nReporter Diane Smith can be reached at 330-298-1139 or dsmith@recordpub.com.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":163862.0}

Mike DeWine ordered all schools to close for an extended-three week spring break that starts at the end of the day on Monday and ends April 3 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The closures do not include child care facilities.\n\n\n\n\"We thought long and hard about that, and we understand the sacrifice this is going to entail, but this is the best medical advice we can get from people who study viruses,\" DeWine said.\n\n\n\nState Superintendent Paola DeMaria was scheduled to speak with educators on a conference call late Thursday afternoon to provide detail and clarity following the school-closing order. While classes are currently set to resume April 3, local districts will decide exactly how to proceed.\n\n\n\nSome districts, including Field and Aurora, had already announced announced days off for students to give the staff in-service time to develop plans for potential extended closures and most districts had begun canceling or postponing large-scale events.\n\n\n\nField had already canceled Monday classes to allow the staff to prepare for potential closures, and now with the governor\u2019s orders, their students\u2019 last day is Friday. Field Superintendent David Heflinger notified families that because their spring break begins (April 6-10) as the mandated closures end, they would be off until at least April 13.\n\n\n\n\"We will provide learning opportunities for our students. Directions will be sent to families next week. We are providing these opportunities to keep students engaged. While we do not know what the State of Ohio will expect in regards to making up time, we will do everything possible to end the school year on the date expected, June 4, 2020,\" Heflinger wrote.\n\n\n\nWaterloo Superintendent Shawn Braman said that school would be canceled for students on Friday, March 13 to allow teachers to plan and develop assignments during the closure. Monday, March 16 would be a regular school day at Waterloo and students will be sent home with school work packets. Because spring break was set last year and because it is contractually obligated, Waterloo will still have spring break April 10-17, which falls after the mandated closure.\n\n\n\nBraman said that while plans have not been finalized, he has been in discussions with their food supervisor and the two are trying to figure out how to continue to provide meals to students. \"That\u2019s a bigger concern for us than academics,\" he said.\n\n\n\nA message on the Ravenna School District\u2019s website said school will be held Friday and Monday. Parents will be notified about the learning plan by the end of the day Monday.\n\n\n\nWindham Superintendent Aireane Curtis said that Windham would make Friday and Monday regular open days for students and staff.\n\n\n\n\"We are still figuring out details of what this will look like for three weeks,\" she said.\n\n\n\nRootstown Superintendent Andrew Hawkins said that Rootstown would continue regular school days on Friday and Monday. Rootstown\u2019s administrative team is meeting Friday morning to determine how education will continue over the next three weeks and how they can continue to feed students. Hawkins expect that he will share the district\u2019s plans related to food and education by Monday.\n\n\n\n\"I think we\u2019ll be getting more guidance for the government, but we want to continue to educate our kids. We\u2019re doing a technology survey right now and we may do a combination of online learning and assignment packets. Whatever we do, we want to make sure it\u2019s meaningful,\" he said.\n\n\n\nStreetsboro has canceled school starting Friday. In an email to families, Superintendent Michael Daulbaugh said that students can pick up medications from school clinics between 8 a.m. and noon on Friday and can pick up school materials between 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Streetsboro staff will report to school at 8 a.m., and will spend the day developing 10 days worth of lessons and activities to help students maintain their learning.\n\n\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s board meeting, Daulbaugh said that those activities would vary based on grade, rigor and subject. If students do not have internet access the district will give them time to work on assignments once they return. Online lessons will be available on the district\u2019s website or through Google classroom beginning next week, and Daulbaugh said he would notify families when those lessons are available. It is expected that students complete these activities until school resumes.\n\n\n\nDaulbaugh added that they are working to reschedule the high school band trip to Disney for a future date this school year.\n\n\n\n\"This situation is very fluid and more information will be provided as it becomes available. The Streetsboro City School District will continue to follow the guidance provided by the Ohio Department of Health, Portage County Health Department, and the Governor\u2019s office. Thank you for your cooperation during this difficult time. It is critical that we do not panic, make good decisions for your families, and most importantly stay safe,\" Daulbaugh wrote.\n\n\n\nCrestwood Schools will also be closed to students starting on Friday, and all athletic practices and events are canceled. The buildings will remain open and wholly staffed on Friday if students need to pick up items, including medicine, Superintendent David Toth said.\n\n\n\n\"Our instruction will continue non-traditionally during this time, except during our Spring Break from March 23 through March 30, by an online platform. Younger students or students that do not have internet access will be provided hard copies. These hard copies will be available in the main offices of each school on Monday to pick up. On Friday, more information will be forthcoming on this topic. Lessons that are in hard copy form and medicine, after Monday, will be able to be picked up at the board office,\" Toth wrote to Crestwood families.\n\n\n\nSoutheast is also closed to students starting on Friday, and staff will spend the day planning remote education. Superintendent Robert Dunn said that next week, March 16-20 would likely be spent planning remote education and allowing students time to pick up supplies, and that remote instruction would likely begin March 23.\n\n\n\n\"I believe we\u2019d be in a hybrid situation where we\u2019re using some online learning and potentially a mixture of some type of grab and go learning, like a blizzard bag,\" Dunn said.\n\n\n\nHe said that while the governor has mandated schools close through April 6, \"we have to think beyond that. We\u2019ll put together short term and long term objectives.\"\n\n\n\nHe added that he is aware that some families rely on the district to provide meals and said \"We\u2019re exploring options to help feed our kids.\"\n\n\n\nSoutheast\u2019s spring break is scheduled for April 10-17, which falls after the mandated closure. Dunn said he would be working with the staff to determine if they would still observe that spring break, or perhaps have a shortened version of it.\n\n\n\nAurora is open on Friday for students and staff, but will not have class on Monday and will not return until April 6 at the earliest.\n\n\n\n\"The buses will run at our normal times tomorrow. We will have a typical school day, but will also use this time for students to collect their belongings and to secure the necessary technology devices for learning during our break. There will be no online learning or expectation of students completing work during the first two weeks of this break,\" Superintendent Pat Ciccantelli wrote to the Aurora community.\n\n\n\n\"Our goal will be to provide alternative learning opportunities beginning the week of March 30. We will communicate the details regarding this alternative instruction schedule through our FinalForms emails and each teacher will communicate information via their typical learning platforms or parent communication program.\"\n\n\n\nMogadore Local Schools Superintendent John Knapp said Friday and Monday are teachers-only days in Mogadore. The day will be used for in preparation for three weeks outside the classroom, two of which are still instructional weeks.\n\n\n\nThe district then will be closed through the end of the day April 3, returning to class April 6, tentatively.\n\n\n\n\"As we understand the order at this time, our players and performers can continue with practices and rehearsals,\" said Knapp.\n\n\n\nWhen they come into work Friday and Monday, teachers will prepare hard copy packets for students to work on with additional online resources referenced in them, Knapp explained.\n\n\n\nState testing for the district was scheduled for the week of April 6, but that is up in the air now, given DeWine\u2019s announcement. Some of the work teachers will likely assemble will be review work that would have been presented in class were it in session.\n\n\n\nParents should pay attention to all-calls and districtwide text messages for specific information about when to pick up packets, he added.\n\n\n\nFifth case of coronavirus in Ohio diagnosed\n\n\n\nOhio Department of Health Director Amy Acton signed an order Thursday banning gatherings of more than 100 people, the governor said. The ban does not include grocery stores, restaurants and bars, forms of transit, athletic events that exclude spectators, weddings, funerals or religious gatherings, DeWine said.\n\n\n\nDeWine on Tuesday asked for event organizers and sporting events to limit spectators. Since then the NBA, NHL, MLS and Major League Baseball have postponed their seasons.\n\n\n\nDeWine said that in the next few days the state will issue regulations to stop all visitation at nursing homes and state psychiatric hospitals. People who work at nursing homes and psychiatric hospitals will have their temperatures tested.\n\n\n\n\"This will not last forever ... Everything we\u2019re doing is temporary,\" DeWine said. \"We will get back to normal in Ohio.\"\n\n\n\nA fifth Ohioan tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. He is a 55-year-old man from Trumbull County. The man has been hospitalized in an intensive care unit and did not go to work after developing symptoms, DeWine said.\n\n\n\nThe five cases are expected to double within six days, DeWine said.\n\n\n\n\"We know that these confirmed numbers are just a small fraction of the individuals who are infected already in the state of Ohio,\" DeWine said.\n\n\n\nThe state received two additional testing kits for the virus, bringing its capacity to test up to 1,200 people, Acton said.\n\n\n\nThere are 52 Ohioans awaiting test results for COVID-19. There are 30 Ohioans who have tested negative so far, according to the state Health Department\u2019s website.\n\n\n\nThe two latest confirmed cases of the virus represent \"community spread,\" officials said. That means a person who had not been traveling abroad was infected by someone else within the U.S.\n\n\n\nActon said the COVID-19 outbreak is expected to peak by late April or mid-May.\n\n\n\nUntil then, Ohioans will have a few tough months ahead of them, she said.\n\n\n\n\"Every action every one of us takes is going to save lives,\" Acton said.\n\n\n\nMax Filby of the Columbus Dispatch contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nReporter Krista S.

As a result, Seaside declared a state of emergency Saturday and the mayor of Warrenton issued a 24-hour notice for visitors to vacate campgrounds, state parks, vacation rentals and hotels.\n\n\"Hordes of people were coming down to the city and to the region in general. It was a clear and present issue and we had to act. So we moved forward to vacate all the campgrounds except for employees and camp hosts,\" said Warrenton Mayor Henry Balensifer.\n\nThe City of Manzanita also ordered all visitors to leave town within 24 hours and return home under the authority of the city's state of emergency declaration.\n\nThe city wrote: \"On behalf of our citizens, business owners and our community who depend on the few resources we have, we request civil cooperation.\"\n\nAstoria Mayor Bruce Jones posted a video Sunday, announcing that under its state of emergency declaration city council approved a ban on vacation and leisure travelers in hotels and short-term rentals. Medical patients and essential workers are still allowed.\n\nNeighboring Seaside went a step further Sunday evening. It ordered hotels and short-term rentals to shut down and restricted access to all public buildings and parks, streams and beaches that run parallel to city limits starting Monday. The city was able to do so under its new emergency declaration, which went into effect Saturday.\n\nRELATED: Seaside Oregon residents start petition to call State of Emergency\n\nSeaside beach areas run from the Cove in the south to the edge of the estuary separating Seaside and Gearhart to the north.\n\nSeaside ordered these restrictions in conjunction with Clatsop County. After declaring an emergency this week, Clatsop County Board of Commissioners took a drastic step on Sunday.\n\nThey banned camping in unincorporated areas of the county and within incorporated areas not under another emergency declaration; closed short-term rentals, homestay lodging and hotels; and closed pools, spas and other public bathing areas. The order begins at noon on March 23 and will last two weeks.\n\nUnder the county's order, hotels are closed except to anyone currently there with reservations longer than 30 days or who has reservations related to work. Campground staff, hosts, and people working in Clatsop County on a temporary basis are exempt from the order.\n\n\u201cWith these measures, Seaside and Clatsop County take mutual steps to protect all of the citizens in our community on the North Coast,\u201d Seaside Mayor Jay Barber.\n\nTillamook County announced Sunday morning it would effectively close outdoor recreation to. It closed all privately-owned, county, state and federal parks parks to day use and overnight camping. It is also closing access to beaches and boat launches (except to commercial fishermen) beginning Monday and lasting through April 28.\n\nTillamook is closing all hotels, motels, bed & breakfasts and short-term rentals to anyone not providing essential services or in the county for commercial purposes.\n\nThe county board of commissioners said in a statement:\n\n\"COVID-19 represents [an] unprecedented threat to public health the likes of which has not been seen in the past 100 years. The severity of the threat to life, health and safety calls for extreme measures and immediate action. We care deeply about the economic resilience of our lodging providers and businesses in the tourism sector and are grateful for their sacrifices for the protection of their employees, guests and the community at large.\"\n\nOregon coast resident Audrey Bige went outside to document the large crowds.\n\n\"It was almost infuriating that people would have such disregard for not only themselves but other people,\" Bige said.\n\nLincoln City, Cannon Beach and Manzanita have all been crowded with people all weekend, prompting concerns for the lack of social distancing.\n\nOne Manzanita resident said it was as packed as the 4th of July and said there needs to be a crackdown. \"Four weeks would help flatten the curve,\" they said.\n\nThe coast has limited healthcare resources and people who live there worry what could happen.\n\n\"These people were coming in, flooding our stores, supplies were starting to get scarce to start with, and our supply chain is a little different than say Portland, where all the warehouses are about 10 miles down the road,\" Balensifer said. \"Our supplies come from quite a distance because ... we have two main roads, Highway 30, Highway 26. An accident happens on one and that whole thing kind of shuts down for a while.\"\n\nBalensifer also pointed to the fact that there are only two hospitals there so they don't have the capacity to care for a surge of people. If a shelter in place order does happen, he doesn't want visitors sheltering in place there. He said visitors are also hoarding goods there because they could not find them in Portland.\n\nResidents in Seaside started a petition asking for the city to take proactive measures and limit spring break activities.\n\nCoastal mayors spoke with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown on a conference call Sunday afternoon.\n\nAs of now, the governor is only asking people to stay home. There has been no official order.\n\nIn a tweet Sunday, Brown wrote, \"On Friday night, I asked all Oregonians, on the eve of spring break, to stay home and stay healthy. Unfortunately, our trails and beaches were packed this weekend.

(KTVZ) -- Deschutes County commissioners officially declared a state of emergency in the county at a special meeting Friday to discuss various aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nCommissioners said the emergency declaration is for 60 days, in an effort to provide emergency funds and policies that can better guide the public.\n\nThey said they want to make clear that this action is not at adding to any sense of panic, but will open the doors for more funds and support to get ahead of the virus, which has one presumptive case in the county at present.\n\nDr. George Conway, the county's health services director, recommended the declaration due to the need for supplies and in anticipation of more cases. He said the second, CDC confirmation for the county COVID-19 case should come back within a week and it will no longer be \"presumptive.\"\n\nConway also said the county is monitoring others now, but they are not \"cases,\" only \"persons under monitoring\" due to possible high-risk contact. He said they're not believed to have the virus.\n\nThe doctor said there's still no evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted in the air, only by droplets from cougs or sneezes, or someone who touches one on a surface.\n\n\"Any time there is a defnable pattern that could help the public, we will share that information,\" Conway told commissioners.\n\nHe said an infectious disease nurse has been working with seniors' long-term care facilities in the county since January, putting plans in place and doing proactive training to keep them safe.\n\nConway said that if the U.S. fails at taking these proactive measures, it will lead to much larger economic catastrophes. Everything people can do to delay the spread also reduces the chances of overwhelming the available resources.\n\nBut he also said: \"The disease is going to get worse before it gets better.\"\n\nHere's their news release:\n\nDeschutes County Commissioners issue emergency declaration\n\nThe Deschutes County Commissioners have issued an emergency declaration in response to COVID-19.

Nathan Garibay, Health Services Director Dr. George Conway and County legal counsel advised the commissioners that the emergency declaration will help county staff quickly respond and utilize all available resources to best protect the health of our community.\n\nLocal public health officials continue to urge residents to wash hands frequently, cover coughs or sneezes and stay home if you show signs of flu or a bad cold, including fever and cough.\n\nTo stay up to date on COVID-19, please visit www.deschutes.org\/covid-19\n\n--\n\nDECLARING A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE CITY OF BEND AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nBend City Manager Eric King has declared a local state of emergency as a result of the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has been confirmed in Deschutes County. Governor Kate Brown has declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Oregon.\n\nThe Bend City Council is scheduled to vote to ratify the declaration, which is in effect through at least April 15, at its meeting Wednesday.\n\nThe declaration allows more flexibility and authorization for the City Manager to take actions to help protect the health and safety of the community, through a number of means from limiting access to public places, to buying items or services related to health and safety without normal procurement procedures that can take additional time.\n\n\u201cWe need to move fast and be nimble in our responses right now, as this is a rapidly evolving situation,\u201d said Mayor Sally Russell. \u201cThis declaration should not inspire concern, but rather, should assure the public that the City is taking every precaution possible to prevent the spread of this virus in our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy primary focus is to restrict the spread of COVID-19 and to maintain the health of our workforce so employees can continue to provide crucial City services,\u201d said City Manager Eric King. \u201cI have and will continue to develop emergency policies regarding the use of sick leave, vacation leave, telecommuting, meeting protocols, and more, which will be in effect for the duration of the emergency.\u201d\n\nWhile this emergency is in place, the City will not send shut-off notices or shut off water for non-payment of unpaid water bills and will not allow any permitted special events of more than 250 people.\n\nTo eliminate exposure and spread of COVID-19, and in support of state and federal guidelines for social distancing, the City has cancelled all advisory committee meetings and public, project-specific outreach meetings or open houses. City employees are encouraged to telecommute and to conduct meetings through online conferencing tools when possible. Disinfecting and cleaning operations have increased significantly in City facilities.\n\nCurrently, scheduled City Council meetings are expected to continue, but with social distancing modifications including increased space between chairs. This results is a smaller capacity in Council Chambers. The City strongly encourages livestreaming the meeting from home through www.bendoregon.gov\/councilagenda.

Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year. Crook County does not currently have any positive cases of COVID-19.\n\nCrook County Emergency Management, with the support of Crook County Court and the City of Prineville, today approved a County Emergency Health Declaration. The local Health Department supports this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the county response to this incident. This declaration will support the need for resources whether that is personnel or supplies. It is consistent with the State Health Emergency Declaration and the National Health Emergency the President announced earlier today.\n\nCrook County and the City of Prineville wants you to know that in partnership with our local and neighboring Health Departments, Law Enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network (COEIN), and medical community, which includes St. Charles Health System, the situation is being monitored very closely and following preparedness plans that are in place for any outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus not only in Oregon but statewide and globally is ongoing.\n\nCrook County Judge, Seth Crawford stated \u201cIt is our goal to continue our preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them\u201d.\n\nThe leadership of the county and city respect the privacy of the community members and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members. With that being said the safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available.\n\nThe joint city and county preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster.\n\nLocal Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza - The CDC is recommending non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:\n\nIf you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nClean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.\n\nTake care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.\n\nConsult CDC\u2019s travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.\n\nStay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.\n\nIt is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.\n\nThis week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people. The city and county strongly believe in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and needs to be followed.\n\nThere is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point. It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. The same precautions are suggested for any communicable disease.\n\nFor more information or general questions contact:\n\nCrook County Health Department\n\n375 NW Beaver Street, Suite 100\n\nPrineville, OR 97754\n\nOffice: 541-447-5165\n\nYou may also call 211 for general inquiries.

Please support local journalism by subscribing to the Times-Union\/jacksonville.com.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Northeast Florida rose again Monday to 82, including a spike in Jacksonville over the weekend that brought the number of cases confirmed by state health officials to 50 in Duval County.\n\nNearly a week into unprecedented restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, Mayor Lenny Curry acknowledged the economic and mental burden placed on residents but said that some people and businesses were taking \"unnecessary risks.\"\n\nCurry announced Tuesday that he is expanding the executive order he issued last week that limited attendance at restaurants and non-essential businesses to 50 people to also require businesses to allow any employees who can work from home to do so.\n\nCOMPLETE COVERAGE | Coronavirus in Florida\n\nThe order will be effective at 8 a.m. Tuesday. City officials said those who do not comply could face fines and citations.\n\nCurry said he even considered enacting a local curfew after hearing reports of large gatherings happening at homes across the city over the weekend but decided not to avoid overwhelming the Jacksonville Sheriff\u2019s Office, which would have been responsible for enforcing it.\n\nHe said state and federal officials could heighten restrictions if the outbreak spiked and began overwhelming local hospitals.\n\n\"We're asking you to do the right thing,\" Curry said. \"If you don't do this, and we don't flatten the curve, you could see a federal or state curfew, and they will enforce it.\"\n\nThe Florida Department of Health has confirmed 1,227 cases around the state, including 82 in Northeast Florida. Five people in the region \u2014 three in Duval and two in Clay \u2014 have died.\n\nDuval leads Northeast Florida with confirmed cases. The state has confirmed eight cases in Clay, 18 in St. Johns, two in Putnam, three in Baker, and one in Nassau.\n\nCurry has led Jacksonville through three hurricanes since becoming mayor in 2015, and his disaster-time updates with emergency officials at his flank have become a somewhat familiar drill for residents. But in a sign of the times, Curry addressed the public and fielded questions from reporters Monday via an online video conferencing platform that was broadcast by local news stations.\n\nCurry said he understood the economic hardships the restrictions have put on small businesses and the toll its taken on people\u2019s mental health. Bars are closed for the next month, restaurants are only serving take out, and kids are at home indefinitely. Even Jacksonville\u2019s beaches are closed.\n\nCurry said the city is exploring policy measures to offer relief to small businesses. He recommended a few coping mechanisms for people to relieve their stress: Call your friends and family often. Listen to music. Exercise, if possible.\n\n\"We have to take care of each other,\" Curry said.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that the state was preparing a field hospital in Jacksonville, one of a few that will be built across the state.\n\nThe field hospitals are being established to handle overflow patients in the event local hospitals become overcrowded. The field hospitals are typically handling non-coronavirus patients because patients infected with the virus need intensive-care beds equipped with negative-pressure ventilation that contains airflow in each room.\n\nCurry said efforts to establish a field hospital in Jacksonville are a preparative measure, and that the site will only open if hospitals in the region are overwhelmed.\n\n\"This is a preparation and only a preparation,\" Curry said\n\nHe said the location of the hospital won\u2019t be released unless it is opened. If opened, the hospital could treat 250 critical-care patients. He said local hospitals have not reached capacity.\n\nCity officials have been working with the state to distribute protective medical equipment to local hospitals, said Emergency Management Chief Steve Woodard. He said the city has distributed 3,600 N95 masks, 25,000 surgical masks and 400 packages of hand sanitizer to local healthcare facilities.\n\nCurry said the city-sponsored drive-thru testing site at the Prime Osborne Convention Center has administered roughly 300 tests since opening last week. Duval County residents who want a test must be screened through the Telescope Health mobile application or website.\n\nThe tests are given by appointment only, and priority will be given to people with a combination of a fever and respiratory symptoms, travel history on cruises or COVID-19 hotspots or who are healthcare workers or first responders.\n\nThe federal testing site at Lot J temporarily closed Monday after reaching its 250-test daily limit. The site will re-open Tuesday at 9 a.m.\n\nTesting at the Lot J location is free, although tests will only be given to people a temperature of 99.6 degrees or higher and respiratory symptoms or healthcare workers and first responders. The site initially limited testing to people 65 years or older, although officials expanded the criteria Sunday to anyone with symptoms of the virus.\n\nAs of Monday evening, there have been 579 tests administered in Duval, 272 in St. Johns, 99 in Clay, 24 in Nassau, 18 in Baker and 97 in Putnam, according to the Florida Department of Health\u2019s database. It\u2019s not clear yet if all local testing is included in the database.\n\nThis content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

The declaration will help the county access state and federal resources.\n\nThe vote followed similar ones in Crook and Deschutes counties.\n\n\"As coronavirus -- aka COVID-19 -- continues to spread, local health officials have stressed that the risk to Central Oregonians remains low,\" said a press release from Jefferson County Public Health. \"Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year.\"\n\n\"The tri-county response has been deliberate and consistent,\" said Public Health Director Mike Baker to the board.\n\n\"Public Health proposed this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the countywide response to this incident,\" the press release said. \"This declaration will support the need for resources including the costs for personnel or supplies for Public Health to respond to the ongoing situation.\"\n\n\"The declarations are consistent with the state health emergency declaration and the national health emergency the president announced earlier today,\" it said.\n\n\"It is our goal to continue our public health preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them.\" Mike Baker, director Jefferson County Public Health\n\nEmily Wegener, the department's emergency preparedness and healthy communities coordinator, said the department is staying in contact with Deschutes and Crook counties, and they are coordinating their response.\n\n\"Jefferson County Public Health has developed strong partnerships with our local and neighboring public health departments, law enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network and the medical community, including the St. Charles Health System,\" the press release said. \"The situation is monitored very closely and is following preparedness plans that are in place for any public health incident or outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus is ongoing, not only locally, but statewide and globally as well.\"\n\nBaker said his department has been tracking the time staff is dedicating to the coronavirus for a couple of weeks.\n\nHe said he knew they would need additional support, \"and this does allow that to happen.\"\n\nIn the press release, Baker said, \"It is our goal to continue our public health preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them.\"\n\n\"Safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available,\" the press release continued. \"The leadership of the county respects the privacy of the community members, and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members.\n\n\"Jefferson County preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster. This is a reminder to the community that Jefferson County Public Health has managed many outbreaks over the years and wants you to rest assured full precautions are being followed with this one as well,\" the release said.\n\nPrevention\n\nJefferson County Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza.\n\nThe CDC is recommending nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:\n\nIf you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nClean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.\n\nTake care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.\n\nConsult CDC's travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.\n\nStay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.\n\nIt is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.\n\n\"This week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people,\" the press release said. \"Jefferson County strongly believes in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and should to be followed.\n\n\"There is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point,\" the press release continued. \"It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. These are the same precautions suggested for any communicable disease.\n\nFor more information or general questions, contact Jefferson County Public Health at 715 SW Fourth Street, Madras, or 541-475-4456.\n\nThe public may also call 211 for general inquiries. The call center is set up to take calls.\n\nCounty sick leave\n\nThe commissioners also approved temporary changes to the county's sick leave policy, provided they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and commit to Oregon Health Authority and Centers for Disease Control guidelines for home isolation.\n\nIn those cases, employees can accrue sick leave up to 80 negative hours; they will be charged 75% of their regular sick leave hours for each full shift while under home isolation; and they will not be required to present a doctor's note before returning to work unless they have been absent for more than 15 days.\n\nThe Madras Pioneer will continue to publish updates on COVID-19, as well as a list of event cancellations.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":21145.0}

If the number of patients who are awaiting test results for unknown respiratory illnesses is included, the number is closer to 300. It\u2019s likely hospitals are treating these patients as if they have COVID-19, out of an abundance of caution.\n\nThis data is delayed and shouldn\u2019t be misconstrued as totally reflective of what hospitals are handling right now. The number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 is likely to be much higher than we are able to report, because of testing result delays, other problems with data reporting and hospitals we weren\u2019t able to gather data from.\n\nOur data is limited because it only includes some of the state\u2019s largest hospitals, and not all hospitals provided the same type of data to us. Some did not respond to our requests for information.\n\nBut our limited data show that the total confirmed case count of 283 confirmed cases in the state is misleading when trying to determine the strain already being placed on the state\u2019s hospitals. The number of people with the virus, as state health officials have said, is much larger than the confirmed case count. Hospitals have been conserving testing supplies by only testing more serious and symptomatic cases.\n\nAt UAB alone, 45 total COVID-19 patients were hospitalized as of Tuesday. Eighteen of those are on ventilators. At least 81 are hospitalized, under observation and awaiting test results, Dr. Sarah Nafziger said Tuesday.\n\nThe number since then is likely to have increased. On Tuesday alone, the number of patients being treated for confirmed COVID-19 infection increased from 17 to 45. Nafziger said the growth has been \u201cexponential.\u201d But UAB is not the only hospital in the state dealing with an influx.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Lee County, which has the third-highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases after Jefferson County and Shelby County, East Alabama Medical Center is caring for more than 30 patients confirmed as having or suspected of having the virus.\n\nSeven of EAMC\u2019s hospitalized patients have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. One of them arrived from a nursing home. But, as of Tuesday night, 27 patients who are hospitalized are suspected of having COVID-19. The hospital is waiting for dozens of tests to return results. One patient has been discharged after being hospitalized because of COVID-19.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLee County has increasingly become a \u201chot spot\u201d in the state for COVID-19 infections. The hospital has submitted 700 kits for testing. 416 have been negative, but 252 are still waiting for results. The age range of people in Lee County tested at EAMC\u2019s sites, who have tested positive, is between 20 and 82. Health-wise, they ranged from mild symptoms to severe symptoms. The average time for a test to get results is four days, but some have taken up to seven days, the hospital said.\n\n\n\nEAMC is asking everyone in the area to shelter in place at home. Sheltering in place means you stay at home with immediate family members only and should not leave your home except for essential activities such as food, medical care, or work.\n\nAt Jackson Hospital in Montgomery, there are 5 patients hospitalized, but their COVID-19 tests are pending, the hospital said.\n\n\u201cWe currently have 5 pending in-patient cases who are being cared for using the appropriate CDC recommended isolation protocols,\u201d the hospital said in a statement. \u201cKeeping patients healthy and safe is central to our mission. The Jackson Hospital staff remain consistent in year-round emergency preparedness training.\u201d\n\nAPR\u2018s interviews with health care practitioners at the hospital suggest the number of suspected cases arriving at the hospital for in-patient or out-patient emergency care may be higher.\n\nAt Baptist Health\u2019s three Montgomery-area hospitals, the health system has treated and discharged one lab-confirmed case of COVID-19, a spokesperson said. But at least 39 patients hospitalized across the system\u2019s three hospitals are awaiting the results of tests for unknown illnesses that include COVID-19, severe bronchitis and the seasonal flu.\n\nIn Dothan, at Southeast Medical Center, which serves Southeast Alabama, Southwest George and Northwest Florida, at least two patients are hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The hospital did not report how many suspected cases it is treating.\n\nHuntsville Hospital CEO David Spillers said Wednesday morning that at least 41 people across the system\u2019s hospitals are hospitalized and awaiting test results for COVID-19. \u201cInformation is coming in as we walk in the door,\u201d Spillers said. Ten of those are in Madison County, and the hospital\u2019s Decatur-Morgan Hospital has 16 in-patients awaiting results. Four in-patients in Madison and Morgan County are confirmed to have COVID-19.\n\nSpillers said the hospital system currently has adequate beds and supplies, and has taken precautions to prepare for more patients. \u201cI guess this is like preparing for a Category 5 hurricane, and hoping like heck it doesn\u2019t hit you, but knowing if it doesn\u2019t hit you, it\u2019ll probably hit somebody else,\u201d Spillers said.\n\nIt should be noted that the numbers in this report do not include patients hospitalized for illnesses and health problems that are not related to COVID-19. People in the state are still suffering heart attacks, having babies and suffering injuries and other health problems that require hospitalization. But hospitals have been able to free up beds by canceling elective procedures.\n\nDCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa, Springhill Hospital in Mobile and Infirmary Health in Mobile did not respond to requests for information by the time of publication. Brookwood Health in Birmingham declined to provide any data.\n\nSo far, the Alabama Department of Public Health has not released hospitalization data, but on a conference call Tuesday with the press, State Health Officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said about 8 or 9 percent of the state\u2019s confirmed cases are hospitalized at this time.\n\n\u201cSome hospitals are reporting increased numbers of patients that seem like they probably are infected with this virus,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd so we have been planning for some time for the possibility of a hospital surge.\u201d\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, at least 283 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the state. Nine percent would equate to roughly 25 patients being treated at hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. That would not include suspected cases, but either way, the number is lower than what hospitals have reported to APR and is likely significantly delayed.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s somewhat lower than most of the other states in the country have reported,\u201d Harris said Tuesday. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re still working hard to make sure we can verify those numbers. But at this point, I think we certainly would say that at least eight or nine percent of those patients who\u2019ve been diagnosed are in a hospital setting.\u201d\n\nHarris has said some hospitals in the state are already nearing their capacity, and the state has been working with hospitals to prepare for more cases. \u201cIt would not take large numbers of people for them to overwhelm their capacity,\u201d said on the call Tuesday.","category":"school_business_closure","population":21145.0}

(Ord. 2018-03 \u00a7 1)\n\nCITY MANAGER UPDATE\n\nOne city counselor had reservations with voting for the declaration because they did not want to add to the panic and confusion. He proceeded to ask questions to make sure they were doing the right thing.\n\n\u201cIn trying times, take a deep breath and try to remain calm,\u201d the counselor said. \u201cWe have a great community that cares and helps each other. Businesses are still open. Just remember to wash your hands, love on your kids and family and shop local. We\u2019ll all get through this together.\u201d\n\nUnder the declaration, the city manager can redirect funds for emergency use, prohibit price gouging and issue other emergency orders.\n\nRestricting travel and curfews are a couple extreme examples of what the city manager can do, and curtailing commercial activity, prohibiting or restricting the sale of alcohol and cannabis, and prohibiting the possession of loaded firearms on public streets, public property or any outdoor place are all powers granted to the city manager. For a full list check out the Lincoln City Municipal Code:\n\nMUNICIPAL CODE: EMERGENCY OPERATIONS\n\nCity offices will remain open although the City prefers to conduct business by phone.\n\nFrom the City of Lincoln City\u2019s website:\n\nAlso on March 16, 2020 Governor Brown issued further directives concerning COVID\u201019.

Please consider a subscription to the Statesman Journal so we can continue to offer stories like this.\n\nUPDATE at 9 p.m. on March 22\n\nLimits on visitors to the Northern Oregon Coast expanded significantly on Sunday in multiple towns from Astoria to Tillamook.\n\nThe Astoria City Council voted Sunday to ban people from outside the area from staying in hotels and other commercial lodging, joining Warrenton's ban of overnight tourists, to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nTo the south, Seaside will close access to city parks and the Oregon Coast beach in addition to hotels and other lodging on Monday. Cannon Beach will close hotels on Monday while also taking the exceptional step of excluding day-visitors through early April, according to a city resolution.\n\n\"All visitors within the City\u2019s jurisdiction are ordered to evacuate within twenty-four (24) hours of the effective date of this Resolution and remain evacuated while this Resolution is in effect,\" said the resolution. \"A visitor is defined as any individual who is spending time in the City for pleasure, recreation or non-business reasons and is not a resident, property owner or business owner.\"\n\nFinally, Tillamook is closing parks and all transient lodging including hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts and short-term rentals, including condos, \"to all visitors who are not providing essential services or are here for commercial reasons such as construction, trucking, etc.,\" the city wrote.\n\nMore coronavirus impact: All Oregon state parks closing March 23 amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nORIGINAL STORY\n\nA town on the Oregon Coast has a simple message for tourists: go home.\n\nThe city of Warrenton passed a resolution Saturday night that essentially makes it illegal for people who live outside city limits to stay the night, including at one of Oregon\u2019s largest campgrounds, due to concerns of coronavirus spread.\n\nResolution 2565, which came after an emergency declaration, was in response to thousands of people flooding the northern Oregon Coast Friday and Saturday despite the pleas of state officials to stay home.\n\n\u201cThe situation meets every definition of a clear and present danger,\u201d Warrenton Mayor Henry Balensifer told the Statesman Journal. \u201cWe had people flooding our shores and town from areas that are hotspots for the virus, treating it like a normal spring break.\n\n\u201cWe saw hundreds of people in one place, our highways completely clogged and a very real danger of the virus spreading to our residents and overwhelming our medical facilities.\n\n\u201cWe had to do something.\u201d\n\nBalensifer said he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if other cities on the coast crafted similar responses. Indeed, two other Oregon Coast mayors called on tourists to stay away by Saturday's end.\n\nBut the Warrenton resolution has real bite. It was unanimously passed by the City Council in cooperation with city police, who will have the power to arrest offenders, officials said.\n\nThe order does not outlaw people from visiting the city during the day, \"although we strongly discourage it right now,\" Balensifer said.\n\nOrder outlaws tourists from spending the night\n\nThe order essentially makes it illegal for people who live outside the city to stay overnight by shutting down anywhere they might stay.\n\nGranted by the power of the emergency declaration, Balensifer said, the order closes camping at the city's marina, on private property and at its four campgrounds \u2014 including Fort Stevens State Park, which has over 400 sites.\n\nThe Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, which originally said it would allow some campers to stay through April 2, said it would comply with the city's order to close camping at the state park.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to respect the city\u2019s directive,\u201d state parks spokesman Chris Havel said of Fort Stevens. \u201cOur intention is to do everything we can to work with them.\u201d\n\nUpdate: All Oregon state parks closing March 23 amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nThe order also closes the city's hotels and short-term rental houses, such as those found on Airbnb, Balensifer said.\n\nThere are multiple exemptions, including for camp hosts, employees and anyone \u201cliving as a long-term resident of the facilities.\"\n\n\"I understand some people are worried about trying to find a place to stay, but we're not charged to take care of those people,\" Balensifer said in a video posted on Facebook. \"It's hard enough to handle what we have, we can't handle thousands of people flooding the city if one gets sick and it spreads.\"\n\nThose who disobey the order \u2014 remaining in town overnight after a 24-hour period that began at 5 p.m. Saturday \u2014 would be subject to a Class C misdemeanor. It is an \u201carrestable offense,\u201d but Balensifer said the goal was to make sure the order was carried out safely.\n\n\"We're giving the police department the ability to use common sense,\" he said.\n\nBalensifer stressed that he\u2019d spoken with county and state officials about the resolution, including senator Betsy Johnson and Lisa Sumption, director of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.\n\n\u201cWe didn't make this decision in a vacuum,\u201d he said.\n\nOther mayors on the Oregon Coast speak out\n\nWarrenton wasn't the only coastal town asking visitors to go home.\n\nTillamook Mayor Suzanne Weber posted a video Saturday asking \"all visitors at the north coast on non-essential business to leave immediately,\" he said.\n\nAstoria Mayor Bruce Jones issued an even more pointed response, saying he was \"appalled by the sight of tens of thousands of irresponsible vacationers flocking to the coast, with callous disregard for residents\u2019 health and safety.\" he wrote.\n\nJones said he was convening an emergency meeting of the Astoria City Council Sunday \"to consider an emergency measure closing commercial lodging to non-residents.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted frustration about the crowds heading from Oregon's largest city to the beach.\n\n\"Bumper to bumper traffic headed to the coast. Reports of block parties on streets. I cannot stress this enough. #COVID19 continues to spread because people don't know they have it,\" Wheeler wrote.\n\nThis story will be updated.\n\nZach Urness has been an outdoors reporter, photographer and videographer in Oregon for 12 years.

Please support more reporting like this by subscribing at the link on top of this page.\n\nBerks County has declared a disaster emergency due to the threat of coronavirus.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nChief Administrative Officer Ron Seaman said at a county commissioners meeting Thursday morning that the declaration should not be seen by the public as a signal to panic, but rather a way to make sure the county can respond as quickly as possible if an outbreak occurs.\n\n\u201cIn any kind of situation like this, time is of the essence,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd acting sooner rather than later is always beneficial. This will allow us to relax the standard in which we normally have to operate so that we can make valid and rational decisions in this ever-changing climate.\u201d\n\nBerks has not yet had a reported case of COVID-19, the coronavirus that has been spreading across the globe.\n\nAs of today, there were 22 cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, according to the state Department of Health.\n\nBerks County Solicitor Christine Sadler said the emergency declaration will allow officials to mobilize quickly and activate a menu of powers they can use to respond to a crisis situation. It also allows the commissioners to conduct meetings as necessary without having to publicly advertise those meetings 24 hours in advance.\n\nSeaman said Berks County Department of Emergency Services Director Brian Gottschall has been collaborating with school districts, local health professionals and municipalities to ensure the appropriate people have the supplies and resources needed to continue services.\n\nLast week, the board decided to set aside $10,000 in emergency spending to be used exclusively to fund activity related to the coronavirus response. Seaman said he will provide a weekly report outlining expenses to various departments for review.\n\n\"This $10,000 isn't a cap,\" Commissioners Chairman Christian Y. Leinbach said at a budget and operations meeting last Thursday. \"The $10,000 is simply a starting point for the fund, and we wanted to establish this fund so that everything is thought out and documented.\"\n\nIn addition to declaring an emergency disaster, the county is also asking people to refrain from visiting Berks Heim nursing home to help ensure the safety of residents and staff.\n\n\u201cWe understand the importance of loved ones remaining in contact and encourage visitors to use alternative communication methods if possible,\u201d Seaman said. \u201cAll individuals, including staff, who come into the building are being screened.\u201d\n\nHe added that Berks Heim administrators are in close contact with the local and state emergency management agencies and following guidelines set by those agencies.\n\nThere will also be no visitation permitted at the county prison in Bern Township. A message posted on the facility website said there will be no family or friend visitation as well as no professional visitation until further notice.\n\nLeinbach asked residents to avoid gathering in large crowds and practice good hygiene to limit the spread of the coronavirus as much as possible.\n\nCommissioner Kevin S. Barnhardt said the county is working to make the April 28 primary election as safe as possible for those who want to vote on the touchscreen machines at their polling locations. He said poll workers will be required to wear gloves to prevent the spread of the illness.\n\nBut he also urged residents to consider casting their votes by mail to avoid lines and crowded spaces. Applications for mail-in ballots can be found on the homepage of the election services website.\n\n\u201cWe just want to make sure people are utilizing every tool necessary to be able to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really hope that people take advantage of this new option.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Michael Rivera reminded residents that they should be checking a website the county launched last week that is specifically designed to communicate information about the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cWe have been working with state and federal authorities and local experts to make sure we are providing the most accurate information to our residents because we feel that it\u2019s important we do all that we can to limit the spread as much as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe board also voted on Thursday to formally establish a chain of command with respect to the response.\n\nBecause the county does not have its own health department like some of its neighboring counties, the commissioners have been designated to take the lead on the response effort by coordinating public-health initiatives and creating a centralized system to distribute health information. Seaman will be second in that chain, Gottschall will serve as third in that line and a public relations coordinator will serve as the final link in the chain.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":413521.0}

He said drop boxes are in place, and county officials can be reached by phone, e-mail or mail.\n\nThe primary county phone number is 814-765-2641 (a complete directory is available online), and residents can also find more information on the Clearfield County Government Web site: www.clearfieldco.org.\n\nCommissioner Dave Glass said there\u2019s a lot of confusion surrounding the mandated closures, and the answer is that state officials have left it up to each county to decide what\u2019s essential and how to handle situations.\n\nAt the present time, he said the county hasn\u2019t laid anyone off, and the commissioners are hoping to avoid that if they can.

To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, Commonwealth employees who work in Dauphin County and the Capitol Complex are directed to follow the instruction provided below beginning tomorrow, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 2020 and extending for a period of 14 days:\n\n\"If you are currently equipped to telework and have the necessary equipment with you, please begin to do so starting (Monday).\n\n\"If you are able to telework but need to obtain the necessary equipment from your office, please report to work to obtain what you need in order to effectively telework. Upon retrieval of needed equipment, return home to begin working from home for the remainder of the day.\n\n\"If you are unsure if you are able to telework, please consult with your supervisor. In all instances where employees report to work, such employees are authorized to be released four (4) hours before their normal quitting times. This early release is subject to the provisions of Management Directive 530.17, Partial and Full-Day Closings of State Offices. If your supervisory staff determines you are unable to telework during the remainder of the 14-day period, you will be authorized for a Paid Office Closing, subject to the provisions of Management Directive 530.17, Partial and Full-Day Closings of State Offices.\n\n\u201cPaid office closing (POC) absences must be entered for non-essential employees who work overtime or out-of-class within the same week of an office closing, if the employee is eligible for payment during an office closing in accordance with Management Directive 530.17.

It will include the commissioners, the county chief administrator, the sheriff, the emergency management coordinator, the human resources director and the county medical director.\n\nAlthough Lawrence County has not had any positive or even suspected cases of the virus yet, county Public Safety Director Jeff Parish said, \"It\u2019s not if, it\u2019s when it\u2019s going to affect us.\"\n\nTuesday\u2019s move was precipitated by news the night before that a confirmed case had been reported in neighboring Beaver County.

Tom Wolf issued a proclamation of emergency for the state two weeks ago and last week ordered all public K-12 schools be closed until the end of the month. On Monday, Wolf urged all non-essential businesses to close for two weeks and for all bars and restaurants to move to take out or delivery only.\n\nBoyd said world health organizations have described the virus\u2019 spread as a pandemic and noted many countries and other states also are struggling with its impact.\n\nFellow commissioner Loretta Spielvogel added, \"We haven\u2019t thought we were immune to something happening, not just in the state, but also the world.\"\n\nBoyd said county officials have been discussing the situation for weeks and have been making adjustments all along. He said the courthouse remains open and county business continues to be conducted, but all residents are being urged to limit their visits. Also, regular cleanings of the building have been increased and hand sanitizer stations have been created near entrances. Travel by county employees also has been restricted.\n\nMany departments have asked residents to pay bills and fines, seek forms and conduct other business with their offices through telephone, mail or online. Drop boxes outside also are available for checks.\n\nCommissioner Dan Vogler said he understands what has been going on is scary, but he urged everyone to remain calm. \"This is a new situation for all of us,\" he said.\n\nVogler and other officials said they are doing all they can to protect residents and get the county through the crisis. Parish said the goal is to \"flatten the curve\" and make sure everyone doesn\u2019t get sick at the same time and overwhelm local health care facilities.\n\nNoting he and other department heads have been in constant contact with their peers in neighboring counties, Parish said they are doing a lot behind the scenes to get on top of the situation.\n\n\"We have a plan for everything,\" he said, noting every part of the county is covered by plans.\n\nBoyd urged everyone to follow health department guidelines about social distancing and proper hand washing to limit the spread and those who do feel symptoms consult with their doctors.\n\nHe stressed the need to get proper information on what is going on from government and legitimate news services, not social media sites, which have been spreading false statements that could be dangerous and make things worse.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":89333.0}

Tom Wolf is ordering mass closings in Montgomery County in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the county. During a press conference Thursday, Wolf says the closures include all schools, gyms, community centers and entertainment venues.\n\nThe state is taking \u201csignificant and decisive social distancing\u201d and will begin putting the plan into effect tomorrow. It will last 14 days in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cNo mass gatherings should be held, including conferences and rallies. By closing these facilities, we can control the spread of this disease, that\u2019s the hope. And we can redirect our public safety and health officials to where they are needed the most,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nPa Gov Wolf announces massive closings in Montgomery County in an effort to control the spread of #COVID19 #cbs3 @CBSPhilly \u2014 Stephanie Stahl (@StahlCBS3) March 12, 2020\n\nWolf says all critical infrastructure will remain open, including all health care facilities, gas stations, grocery stores, government and mass transit.\n\nWolf says Montgomery County is the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak where there are 13 of the state\u2019s 22 cases. Among the cases are a doctor and a police officer \u2014 people with broad contacts in the community.\n\n\u201cThe goal is not to shut anybody down, the goal is to keep Pennsylvania safe and by taking action, decisive action to mitigate, we\u2019re moving beyond simply containing,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nThe governor\u2019s closing order covers places like the Ardmore train station. Suburban Square is currently open.\n\nThe King of Prussia Mall says it will remain open and is leaving it up to retailers to decide whether or not they will close.\n\n\u201cKing of Prussia will remain open for our retailers, and we are leaving it to them to decide whether they remain open or close. With respect to Governor Wolf\u2019s statement today, the Governor did not mandate store closures and did not define what nonessential retail is. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will comply with any federal, state or local government requirements as they arise. We will keep you posted on any new developments,\u201d the mall said in a statement.\n\nPlymouth Meeting Mall and Willow Grove Park Mall will be closed for two weeks effective Friday.\n\nThe Valley Forge Casino Resort will close to the public on Friday and will remain closed through Friday, March, 27.\n\nShoppers stocked up at local groceries stores in preparation.\n\n\u201cWe are topping up from our previous pandemic shopping,\u201d Lower Merion resident Brian Gordon said. \u201cThere\u2019s long lines, but people are really polite and sane. Montgomery County is functioning well.\u201d\n\nAnother shopper headed straight to the gym after her shopping.\n\n\u201cIt closes tomorrow so it will be my last night at the gym,\u201d Jill Diamond said. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking forward to seeing my friends and then I don\u2019t know what, I\u2019ll take a lot of walks.\u201d\n\nAny state employee traveling in and out of Montgomery County is now being directed to work remotely.\n\nWolf is also encouraging large gatherings to be canceled or postponed; discouraging people from going to recreational activities in public places; and asking religious leaders to use their discretion to prevent the spread of the virus through their congregations and their communities.\n\n\u201cThese actions may seem severe but they\u2019re far less draconian than what we have to do in the future if we don\u2019t act now,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWe will begin putting this plan into effect for 14 days, beginning tomorrow.\u201d\n\nDr. Valerie Arkoosh, chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, also announced the banning of all big gatherings in the county.\n\n\u201cWe, here at the county, are imploring our community to cancel non-essential public and private gatherings, both indoor and outdoor,\u201d Arkoosh said.\n\nShe says the county supports the governor\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to slow the rate of spread of disease and to decrease the ultimate total number of individuals who are impacted,\u201d Arkoosh said.\n\nArkoosh also recognizes this will not be easy on county residents.\n\n\u201cWe know that this is difficult,\u201d Arkoosh said. \u201cWe urge you to continue to remain calm all week.\u201d\n\nEarlier Thursday, four more presumptive positive coronavirus cases were announced in Montgomery County, bringing the total to 13.

If an individual doesn\u2019t have a primary care physician, several health care systems are providing telehealth services so residents may be evaluated by a provider without having to leave their homes.\n\nIf it\u2019s determined an individual should be tested, they will be instructed where to go to be tested. Individuals with minor illness are advised not to go to emergency departments, the release said.\n\nBeaufort Memorial Hospital posted a news release Sunday asking for patients or loved ones to call ahead in the event that they have a fever, cough and shortness of breath.\n\n\u201cYour doctor's office will ask you a few questions and then give you appropriate instructions, which may include coming to their office for care or reporting to another site to receive rapid influenza and strep tests,\u201d the post said.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, patients may be asked to wait in their cars while a medical provider administers and processes the tests.

There are currently over 300 cases of COVID-19 in South Carolina, 36 in Charleston County.The ordinance will require \"non-essential businesses\" to close and will direct citizens to stay at home unless making necessary trips to the grocery store, the pharmacy, or other essential services.All city services, including police and fire assistance, are still active, the mayor reminded attendants at the press conference.Tecklenburg also ordered the temporary closure of all city parks and playgrounds, joining the long list of facilities shuttered due to COVID-19.Council passed the ordinance in a 9-4 vote. \"I know this is very painful to a lot of business owners that right now can't move forward and do what they need to do,\" councilman Kevin Shealy said at Tuesday's council meeting. \"But, I believe we've got to do whatever we can to shorten that time period.\"Councilwoman Marie Delcioppo voted against the measure, citing her concern that the city is moving ahead of the state. She also argued that labeling businesses as \"essential\" and \"non-essential\" is subjective. \"I feel like this is way jumping the gun and putting us in a position that is going to be very, very hard to manage and come back from,\" she said at the meeting.In a statement on Tuesday, Charleston County Council Chairman Elliott Summey said the county was not considering similar measures.\u201cCharleston County does not have any immediate plans to follow course in the unincorporated areas of the County. The Governor, through Executive Order, has not allowed such action,\u201d Summey said. \u201cTherefore, the County will continue to follow the State's mandates in response to the coronavirus\/COVID-19 pandemic.\u201dDHEC announced on Monday that in S.C., coronavirus has reached its acceleration phase, the period building up to the disease's peak. Attempts to \"flatten the curve,\" or stop COVID-19's acceleration phase from skyrocketing, have led to closures of restaurant dining rooms, schools, and city buildings. An order from Governor Henry McMaster on March 13 allows law enforcement to, at their discretion, break up groups of three or more outside of a home.\"Charleston is facing thousands of deaths \u2014 most of them unnecessary \u2014 if we don't stop the spread of this virus,\" Tecklenburg said at a press conference before Tuesday's meeting. \"This moment \u2014 with the pandemic still in the earliest part of the acceleration phase \u2014 is our last, best chance to keep that tragedy from happening.\"","category":"shelter_in_place","population":372803.0}

The decision locally came after a Tennessee Supreme Court order last week suspending in-person court proceedings until March 31.\n\n\u201cThe judges have been good helping us getting the prisoners released that we need out. I met with the criminal court judges and the chancellor in Cookeville last Friday and that evening I met with DeKalb County General Sessions and Juvenile Court Judge Bratten Cook, II and we talked about the inmates we have here. We had some inmates in jail for non-violent crimes who were awaiting bond hearings, arraignments, etc. and others already sentenced who were close to completing their terms. We also looked at older inmates including those with pre existing health conditions. We didn\u2019t want to possibly further endanger their health if someone came into the jail with COVID-19 so the judges did orders on those inmates to release them and we have been doing that since last Friday. We are only releasing inmates who are non-violent. Prisoners incarcerated for violent crimes including sex offenses, robberies, etc. will not be released,\u201d said Sheriff Ray.\n\n\u201cWe currently have 27 inmates in our jail and two or three of them will be released when their sentences expire Sunday. Since last Friday, we have only had four new prisoners come into our jail.\u201d\n\nFor new prisoners entering the jail, Sheriff Ray said a protocol is being followed to monitor their condition and to keep them from exposing others in the event they should be diagnosed with the virus.\n\n\u201cWe have a quarantine cell with three rooms where we lock down inmates who are newcomers to the jail. They go through a protocol and a nurse assesses them for five days to make sure they don\u2019t develop a fever,\u201d he said.\n\nSheriff Ray began restricting public access to the facility last week until further notice due to the threat of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cOur number one priority is to prevent possible exposure to staff as well as inmates therefore we have placed the sheriff\u2019s office and jail on a soft lock down which means that the general public is not able to enter the facility. The front door to the lobby has been locked. Anyone in need of an officer or services such as a warrant must press a button at the front door which will ring for a correctional officer who will meet you at the door to offer assistance,\u201d said Sheriff Ray.\n\nFor all non-emergency issues please call 615-597-4935.\n\n\u201cTuesday night church services and family visitations with inmates at the jail are prohibited except for online visitations and the inmate roadside litter pickup program has been suspended until the threat subsides,\u201d said Sheriff Ray.\n\n\u201cRather than an in court appearance, video conferences are being arranged for defendants needing an immediate hearing before a judge for certain matters such as bond conditions, etc.,\u201d he said.\n\nTo keep the jail from being infected, regular wipe downs are being conducted throughout the jail and cell areas.\n\nThe pandemic threat has also created a lack of some menu food items and cleaning products at the jail as the supply from vendors has run short although a new shipment is expected in a few days.","category":"None","population":19164.0}

I would rather be accused of over-reacting for the safety of our community than looking back in retrospect wishing I would have done more to protect the citizens of Montgomery County,\u201d Durrett said.\n\nWhat about local businesses?\n\n\u201cI am also requesting that the citizens and businesses of Montgomery County follow our lead and take proactive steps to prevent the spread of this virus. I realize taking some of these steps will be very difficult and, in some cases, may cause financial loss. Unfortunately, if we do not make changes, the long-term risk is likely to be much more costly,\u201d Durrett said.\n\nMany small businesses, including the food service industry, have or are formulating provisions for drive-through or pick-up options. Citizens are encouraged to continue patronizing all businesses in a way that minimizes social contact, the release said.\n\nDurrett encouraged people to help each other whenever possible.\n\n\u201cIf you are well enough and conditions require you to stay at home and a neighbor is working; please volunteer to do things like; mow their lawn, haul their garbage (wear protective gloves), pick up groceries or help in whatever way you can. Together, we will get through this.\u201d\n\nPublic meetings\n\nAs for normal monthly meetings of commissioners, Durrett told The Leaf-Chronicle there is still much to be ironed out.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at asking our legislators to consider looking at legislation to enable us to post a call-in number for the public to use without having to attend our commission meetings in person through this period, and in a way that satisfies the intent of the open meeting law, but there\u2019s nothing definite on that.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime we\u2019re looking at possibly cancelling a lot of our committee meetings and channeling all of their conversations through the Budget Committee, and again at the same time meet the intent of the open meetings law,\u201d Durrett said. \u201cBut nothing has been firmed up on any of that.\u201d\n\nThe city council meets in monthly executive session on Thursday, March 26, and Pitts isn\u2019t relishing the thought of having Council chambers full of officials and guests with a coronavirus outbreak on everyone\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cState law requires that we can\u2019t do telephonic meetings unless that rule is suspended, so we\u2019ll have our meeting and try to limit the crowds as best we can,\u201d Pitts said.\n\nCDC guidelines\n\nDurrett urged following the guidelines been set forth by the CDC:\n\n1. Listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.\n\n2. If you feel sick, stay home. Do not go to work. Contact your medical provider.\n\n3. If your children are sick, keep them at home. Do not send them to school or daycare. Contact your medical provider.\n\n4. If someone in your household has tested positive for the coronavirus, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work. Do not go to school. Contact your medical provider.\n\n5. If you are an older adult, stay home and away from other people.\n\n6. If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lung or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.\n\n7. Even if you are young, or otherwise healthy, you are at risk and your activities can increase the risk for others. It is critical that you do your part to stop the spread of the coronavirus:\n\nWork or engage in schooling from home whenever possible.\n\nIf you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule. You and your employers should follow CDC guidance to protect your health at work.\n\nAvoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.\n\nAvoid eating or drinking in bars, restaurants, and food courts \u2013 use drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options.\n\nAvoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits.\n\nDo not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.\n\n8. Practice good hygiene:\n\nWash your hands, especially after touching any frequently used item or surface.\n\nAvoid touching your face.\n\nSneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow.\n\nDisinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible.\n\nChris Smith contributed to this report.

(Each of the latest orders are embedded below in full.)\n\nWhile the governor\u2019s public health disaster \u2014 which bans gatherings of 10 or more people through April 3 \u2014 supersedes the city and county emergency declarations, the city and county can add additional restrictions or dates that go beyond what the state has limited.\n\nIn Bexar County\u2019s case, Wolff added provisions to suspend evictions and foreclosures as well as forbidding price gouging. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said the city would follow those provisions, as well.\n\nRestaurants will be allowed to operate drive-thru, deliver and takeout orders for curbside pickup. Grocery stores, gas stations and other vital businesses will also remain open. Nirenberg said it was a tough decision but that stopping the spread of the respiratory disease known as COVID-19 is paramount.\n\nGatherings larger than 10 people are also still barred, with few exceptions.\n\nFor the state of Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order related to COVID-19 preparedness and mitigation. His order goes into effect at midnight Friday through midnight April 3, but it could be extended, Abbott said.\n\nWhere it mirrors Abbott\u2019s, Judge Wolff\u2019s order also lasts through April 3, unless extended.\n\nHis directions regarding evictions, foreclosures, price gouging, and specifically banning groups of 10 or more people within an enclosed space, however, would all last for 30 days.\n\nThe San Antonio City Council also voted Thursday to extend the measures Nirenberg had ordered the evening before for 30 days - or through April 19 - though they can be lifted earlier. It was originally effective for seven days.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know:\n\nBusinesses barred from operating\n\nAs part of the declaration, several retail businesses are closed.

We e don't know a lot about this disease,\" said Wolff.\n\nIn his issuance, Wolff declared \"that ingress into and travel throughout Bexar County and the remaining 26 municipalities from Lackland by those persons that have been quarantined in the facility is not permitted.\"\n\n\"They need to have someone pick them up and take them out just as they brought them here, and not expose our population to any potential problem,\" said Wolff.\n\nThe public health emergency went into effect immediately following the declaration and will continue for up to seven days unless continued or renewed by the Bexar County Commissioners Court.\n\nEarlier Monday, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg declared a \"local state of disaster and a public health emergency\" over concerns about the potential spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"Regardless of what the federal and state governments do, at the local level, we're going to do everything within our power to protect the public,\" said Nirenberg.\n\nNirenberg's declaration activates the city's emergency management plan and authorizes the city to \"commandeer or use any private property, temporarily acquire, by lease or other means, sites required for temporary housing units or emergency shelters for evacuees, subject to compensation requirements.\"\n\n\"Our guidance from the medical community and what we've seen from medical professionals throughout the world, really is that we need to ensure that additional testing is done and that the quarantine period may need to last longer,\" said Nirenberg. \"These are Americans.

The judge later joined Mayor Nirenberg in issuing a joint letter pushing to keep the disease from going around San Antonio. The city leaders want to make sure evacuees stay under quarantine at JBSA-Lackland until it's confirmed they have the coronavirus.\n\n\"We have asked over and over not to transport these people into the city of San Antonio. They're not citizens of San Antonio, they're not citizens of Bexar County. We've asked them not to do that. They have totally ignored that,\" said Wolff.\n\nBoth Wolff and Nirenberg said that although the risk still remains low for the public, the emergency declarations are about being prepared.\n\n\"We're doing that with the guidance of our medical community so that people don't have to be concerned about going into the public. So people don't have to be concerned about visiting our city. We want to make sure that the risk of exposure remains low.

To date, no response or even an acknowledgement of those concerns has been received and an individual was transported into the community who had tested positive; and\n\nWHEREAS, of even date of this declaration of a local state of disaster on behalf of Bexar County, the Mayor of the City of San Antonio has issued a Declaration of Public Health Emergency; and\n\nWHEREAS, in an abundance of caution, and to protect the unincorporated areas of Bexar County and the remaining 26 municipalities contained within Bexar County, I, Nelson W.

However, this person tested positive for the virus on a third test, with results coming in after release and may have potentially exposed the public to the virus; and\n\nWHEREAS, the person has been returned to quarantine at Lackland while the CDC and local health authorities are taking steps to ensure the community is kept safe and the exposure risk is minimized; and\n\nWHEREAS, it is necessary to the preserve and protect the public health of the residents of Bexar County that those quarantined persons at Lackland remain within the confines of those safe, secure facilities during the quarantine period following their exposure to the virus; and\n\nWHEREAS, following the release of the person from Cohort 1 and positive test after that release, the imminent movement of those quarantined at Lackland by the CDC to other facilities within the Bexar County, including transport to the airports within Bexar County for travel to other secure locations, increases the risks to the residents of Bexar County, creates a public health threat, and requires the County to mitigate the risk of disease and manage the concerns of residents in and around Bexar County; and\n\nWHEREAS, pursuant to the Texas Disaster Act of 1975, the County Judge may declare a local state of disaster in and for the County, and may exercise the powers granted therein on an appropriate local scale; and\n\nWHEREAS, a declaration of local disaster and public health emergency includes the ability to reduce the possibility of exposure to disease, control the risk, promote health, compel persons to undergo additional health measures that prevent or control the spread of disease, including isolation, surveillance, quarantine, or placement of persons under public health observation, including the provision of temporary housing or emergency shelters for persons misplaced or evacuated and request assistance from the governor of state resources; and\n\nWHEREAS, by this declaration, I declare all rules and regulations that may inhibit or prevent prompt response to this threat suspended for the duration of the incident; and\n\nWHEREAS, pursuant to the authority granted to the County Judge under the Texas Disaster Act of 1975, I authorize the use of all available resources of state government and political subdivisions to assist in the County\u2019s response to this situation; and\n\nWHEREAS, I, Nelson W. Wolff, the County Judge and presiding officer of Bexar County, have determined that in order to remain consistent with the Declaration of Public Health Emergency issued by the City of San Antonio, extraordinary and immediate measures must be taken to respond quickly, prevent and alleviate the suffering of people exposed to and those infected with the virus, as well as those that could potentially be infected or impacted by COVID-19 throughout Bexar County and within the remaining 26 municipal jurisdictions in Bexar County;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, BE IT DECLARED BY THE COUNTY JUDGE OF THE COUNTY OF BEXAR:\n\nThat a local state of disaster and public health emergency is hereby declared throughout Bexar County pursuant to \u00a7418.108(a) of the Texas Government Code.\n\nPursuant to \u00a7418.108(b) of the Government Code, the state of disaster and public health emergency shall continue for a period of not more than seven days from the date of this declaration unless continued or renewed by the Bexar County Commissioners Court.\n\nPursuant to \u00a7418.108(c) of the Government Code, this declaration of a local state of disaster and public health emergency shall be given prompt and general publicity and shall be filed promptly with the County Clerk.\n\nPursuant to \u00a7418.108(d) of the Texas Government Code, this declaration of a local state of disaster and public health emergency activates Bexar County\u2019s emergency management plan.\n\nPursuant to the authority granted under the laws of the State of Texas, this declaration authorizes Bexar County to take any actions necessary to promote health and suppress disease, including quarantine, examining and regulating hospitals, and regulating ingress and egress into or throughout Bexar County.\n\nPursuant to the statutory authority vested in me as the presiding officer of the County of Bexar, I declare that ingress into and travel throughout Bexar County and the remaining 26 municipalities from Lackland by those persons that have been quarantined in the facility is not permitted.

Burnet County Judge James Oakley signed an emergency declaration for the county due to COVID-19. Staff photo by Daniel Clifton\n\nWhile some of the recommendations for slowing the spread of COVID-19 seem extreme, Burnet County authorities assured the public they are necessary.\n\nOn March 19, Texas Governor Greg Abbott emphasized the CDC recommendations by issuing a public health disaster followed by an executive order stating \u201cpeople shall avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts, or visiting gyms or massage parlors.\u201d He is encouraging the use of takeout or drive-through options for restaurants.\n\nThe executive order is in effect from 11:59 p.m. March 20 through 11:59 p.m. April 3.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t just protecting yourself, it\u2019s protecting others,\u201d said Burnet County Health Authority Dr. Juliette Madrigal during a special Burnet County Commissioners Court meeting March 19.\n\nMadrigal explained that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads three times greater than the typical flu.\n\nBased on current information about COVID-19 gathered from other states and countries, Madrigal said the expectation is 50 percent of the general population will contract COVID-19.\n\nThe key to slowing the spread, Madrigal said, is limiting contact with other people and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations outlined as of March 16. The newest guidelines recommend limiting social gatherings to 10 or fewer people for at least the next two weeks.\n\nAlong with the previous mentioned actions, Abbott\u2019s executive orders:\n\navoid gatherings of more than 10 people\n\nclose schools temporarily\n\nrestrict access to nursing homes, retirement centers, and long-term care facilities unless a person is providing critical care\n\nIt is not a \u201cshelter in place\u201d order.\n\nDuring her presentation, Madrigal explained that 15-20 percent of the people who contract COVID-19 would require hospitalization, while about 5 percent of those would need a respirator and intensive care.\n\nBurnet County officials said it is inevitable the virus will make its way to the Highland Lakes, but slowing the spread could allow for a better response by health care facilities. The key, Madrigal said, is avoiding a spike in cases like what happened in Italy and other countries.\n\nWith a limited number of intensive care unit beds and respirators, a sudden influx of serious COVID-19 cases would overwhelm the health care system. Madrigal said Burnet County has only four respirators at this time.\n\nMadrigal said the other 80 percent of COVID-19 cases would not require hospitalization, though some people might feel extremely ill.\n\nWhile the disease seems to affect older people and those with underlying health issues, Madrigal urged healthier and younger residents not to get complacent.\n\nShe pointed out that the first cases of COVID-19 were first reported only about three months ago in China and there is still much to learn about the disease.\n\nIn Burnet County, about 20 people have been tested for it as of March 19, and there were no confirmed cases, Madrigal said.\n\nIf a person in Burnet County is confirmed to have the disease, it will be reported to Madrigal, who then reports it to Burnet County Judge James Oakley. Oakley said they will share that information with the public.\n\nAs more testing becomes available, Madrigal anticipates the number of confirmed cases in Texas to rise and for there to be some in the Highland Lakes. As of noon March 19, Texas had 143 confirmed COVID-19 cases and three deaths.\n\nAnyone who suspects they have COVID-19 should call or email their doctor or other health care professionals before visiting a medical facility, Madrigal said. However, she added, if a person is struggling to breath or has other serious issues, they should seek immediate help.\n\nMadrigal offered some good news during the March 19 meeting. She pointed out that clinical trials have begun on a vaccine for COVID-19, which is remarkably fast. Typically, it takes 12 months from start to finish before a vaccine is ready for public use, but Madrigal said she\u2019s optimistic about this one.\n\n\u201cI expect this vaccine to be deployed much faster,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile there is much emphasis on limiting contact with other people, Madrigal said that doesn\u2019t mean locking yourself indoors and shunning everyone. She emphasized the importance of getting outside with friends and family, remembering to limit it 10 or fewer people at one time.\n\n\u201cI want you to go for a hike with your daughter. I want you to go fishing with your son,\u201d Madrigal said. \u201cGet out in your garden. Don\u2019t spend it all indoors.\u201d\n\nCheck the websites for Burnet County, Texas Department of State Health Services, and CDC for more information.\n\ndaniel@thepicayune.com\n\nGovernor Greg Abbott\u2019s orders\n\nOrder No. 1: In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, every person in Texas shall avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.\n\nOrder No. 2: In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, people shall avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts, or visiting gyms or massage parlors; provided, however, that the use of drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options is allowed and highly encouraged throughout the limited duration of this executive order.\n\nOrder No. 3: In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, people shall not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.\n\nOrder No. 4: In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, schools shall temporarily close.","category":"None","population":43823.0}

It\u2019s issued in conjunction and in recognition of the action recently taken by the county in protection of its citizens and in the interest of the general public health.\u201d\n\nWhite noted the declaration bars all gatherings of 50 or more people.\n\n\u201cA gathering generally refers to a scheduled event or common endeavor where 50 people are present in a confined space, room or area,\u201d said White. \u201cThe limitation on the size of gatherings shall extend to commercial, retail, wholesale, industrial, service, eating and entertainment establishments, with the exception of grocery stores.\n\n\u201cThe representatives of such establishments shall be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the limitation on the size of the gatherings.\u201d\n\nThe order does not extend to grocery stores or places of employment that don\u2019t provide venues or opportunities for social gatherings.\n\nViolation of the order is punishable as a Class C misdemeanor by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or 180 days in jail.\n\nWhite noted the declaration will last for seven days. The city will call a special meeting on Tuesday of next week to determine whether the declaration should be extended and will continue to do so each week as needed.\n\n\u201cThis requirement on the number of people may change if we start to the reporting of Covid-19 cases in Caldwell County, but as was reported today, there are none,\u201d White said. \u201cWe do this in consideration of the public health, and we try to limit as much as we can the effect, especially on small businesses.\u201d\n\nWhile there have still been no confirmed cases in Caldwell County, Austin and Travis County officials confirmed the first two \u201cpresumptive cases\u201d of the virus in the area on Friday, marking the county\u2019s closest encounter to virus yet. The cases are considered presumptive after testing positive by state officials. They are then sent to the Centers for Disease Control for final confirmation.\n\nLockhart officials have reminded residents they have the option to pay bills online and at drop-off locations to limit face-to-face contact. The online payment option can be found at http:\/\/lockhart-tx.org\/page\/utility_home.\n\nTwo centrally located drop boxes are located at the front and back of City Hall \u2014 308 W. San Antonio \u2013 and are checked twice a day. A drive-through location can be found at the Municipal Court Building, 1914 W. San Antonio St.\n\nTo mitigate risks associated with large crowds, Lockhart officials canceled all the spring break events scheduled at the Dr. Eugene Clark Library through March 31 and has indefinitely postponed the KIDFISH and Welcome Spring Day event that was scheduled for March 21.\n\nLockhart City Manager Steve Lewis added that Lockhart Senior Center is closed but is still providing meals through delivery. The food bank will still remain open, but only be appoint.\n\nLewis added, while not official, it appears likely the upcoming Lone Star Grand Prix kart racing will likely be pushed back to next year.\n\nAccording to Lewis, the Lockhart Police Department has been taking some police reports by phone to limit face-to-face interactions when not necessary.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not time sensitive or a critical emergency, we\u2019re trying to do things over the phone,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring his address, Gov. Abbott told Texans on Friday there was no need to hoard or panic-buy supplies, though many stores in Lockhart have seen bare shelves.\n\nTo address the issue, HEB officials announced Saturday morning that stores throughout the state would be opening at 8 a.m. and closing at 8 p.m. to give overnight crews more time to restock important items associated with hindering the spread of the virus.\n\nOn Friday, HEB officials issued a press release stating the company was still in a strong position to restock shelves and encouraged customers to remain calm.\n\nWal-Mart stores throughout the country are taking similar measures, changing hours of operation nationwide to 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. to give staff members additional time to restock.\n\nFor more information about symptoms and strategies to minimize exposure, visit https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/index.html.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":39232.0}

It does not add any further restrictions to businesses or residents.\n\nUmphress shared scripture from 2 Timothy 1:7 on Facebook when he posted the declaration.\n\n\u201cFor God will never give you the spirit of fear, but the Holy Spirit who give you mighty power, love and self-control,\u201d the post read.\n\nThe Jack County Commissioner\u2019s Court is set to meet on Monday, March 30, to ratify the declaration for a longer period of time.\n\nMayor Alton Morris serves as the emergency management authority for the city while Jacksboro Fire Department Chief Jeremy Jennings serves as the emergency management coordinator for the city of Jacksboro.\n\n\u201cBecause this is a medical emergency then the one who would kick-off any type of emergency management plan would be the local health authority, (Dr. Robert Cooper,)\u201d City Manager Mike Smith said.\n\nThe council weighed two options in which the Mayor alone could have declared an emergency that only lasts seven days or the council could declare a state of emergency for an indefinite amount of time.\n\nThe council ultimately decided to declare a state of emergency as a whole and the declaration will remain in effect until discontinued.\n\n\u201cThe fact that Judge Umphress declared an emergency for the county, it covers the city, he has that authority,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHowever, if the city does not declare an emergency we will not be eligible for any federal or state funds that might come along to help us pay for anything we need to as a result of this emergency.\u201d\n\nThe city manager said city hall will be locked to the public except by appointment, but they are still going to be accepting payments, although the public is encouraged to pay online if possible. Twin Lakes Activity Center will also be closed as part of the declaration.\n\nSmith will be authorized to take necessary action regarding fees associated with utility billing including extending time for payment and suspending utility shut offs for customers negatively impacted by job loss or reduced income due to COVID-19 with documentation.\n\nSmith said the police department can fine any violators up to $1,000 or place them in jail for up to 180 days, but he does not foresee those measures needing to be taken.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to go out and start arresting people or writing citations because they are eating at JR\u2019s,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI think for the most part we have seen people are policing themselves when it comes to that. But, certainly it gives us this ability to take some action should there be something really extreme happen.\u201d\n\nHe added the declaration does not add anymore restrictions to businesses and activities in town than what has already been placed by Governor Gregg Abbott and President Donald Trump.\n\nAbbot declared a public health disaster for the state of Texas on March 19 to last through Friday, April 3.\n\nThe executive order contains four parts: 1. Every person in Texas shall avoid social gatherings and groups more than 10; 2. People shall avoid eating and drinking in bars and restaurants, in food courts or visiting gyms; 3.

The cities of Waco and Lacy Lakeview adopted similar restrictions Tuesday, and Bellmead on Wednesday amended an earlier declaration to follow suit, taking effect immediately.\n\nRobinson, Woodway and the county have opted to only limit the seating capacities of dining rooms. All have prohibited public and private gatherings of 50 people or more.\n\nMcLennan County Judge Scott Felton declared a local state of disaster and public health emergency for McLennan County, enacting restrictions that will apply to unincorporated areas. Under the restrictions, the capacity of indoor recreation facilities, bars, clubs and restaurants will be limited to either 50% of their capacity or 50 people, whichever is less. The declaration also prohibits events that bring together more than 50 people.\n\nDuring a special meeting, the county noted that municipalities such as Waco retain authority over their domains.\n\nMcLennan County Judge Scott Felton said he had been in discussions with city managers in the area, and with a few restaurant owners, to get their feel of the situation.\n\nPrecinct 4 Commissioner Ben Perry mentioned he stopped at a small restaurant on his way to the courthouse, and there were as many people standing in line to retrieve their call-in orders as could have been seated in the dining area, so \u201cmingling\u201d is inevitable.\n\nPerry said he counted 13 restaurants, most very small, operating within the county\u2019s unincorporated area that would be impacted by the county\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\nCoronavirus latest: What's happening around Waco The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in McLennan County increased by three on Saturday, March 21, bringing the total to 16.\n\nHewitt made its declaration Wednesday morning.

If you have a local emergency, you can call the state and get resources to your locality if you need them,\u201d Dalton said Thursday. \u201cThis is also in preparation in the event, as is typically a requirement in federal government, if we do spend any funds to address this COVID-19 (pandemic). As far as we know from the state health department, we still don\u2019t have any confirmed cases yet.\u201d\n\nDalton said business continues as usual in the county administrator\u2019s office and most other county agencies inside the Carroll County Governmental Complex.\n\n\u201cPeople are still walking in. What we are doing is encouraging everybody to follow the governor\u2019s and president\u2019s recommendations to just stay home and stay away the best they can,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cTry to limit your travel and be done with it.\u201d\n\nThe declaration of emergency reads as follows:\n\nWHEREAS, in accordance with Virginia Code Section 44-146.21. that gives a local government the ability to declare a state of emergency to protect its citizens from current and potential emergencies: and\n\nWHEREAS, The SARS-CoV02 (COVID-19) has been declared a world pandemic, and is a novel disease that has resulted in death to our most vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immune depressed; and\n\nWHEREAS, Carroll County understands the economic impact that COVID-19 is causing not only on the national stage but the local economy and the risk to its businesses; and\n\nWHEREAS, the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia have declared States of Emergency to protect their citizens, and to get more information out, as well as to move the proper resource to the affected areas; and\n\nWHEREAS, Carroll County reinforces the guidance from the Federal government of reducing exposure by limiting the number of people in a group, using good hygiene and cleaning of high traffic areas, and social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and\n\nWHEREAS, Carroll County will continue to monitor the ever-changing situation, implement county plans, and provide information to the public to further mitigate the spread and comfort its citizens from panic that could occur from such an emergency.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY PROCLAIMED, the Carroll County Board of Supervisors declares that Carroll County is under a State of Emergency by the Director of Emergency Management, and the Emergency Operations Plan is now in effect on this 19th day of March, 2020.\n\nAllen Worrell can be reached at (276) 779-4062 or on Twitter@AWorrellTCN\n\nhttps:\/\/www.thecarrollnews.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/breaking-news-6.gif\n\nDalton calls it a precautionary measure to deal with COVID-19","category":"state_of_emergency","population":29883.0}

Many non-essential businesses have closed during the coronavirus outbreak as shoppers stay away. AP Photo\n\nNorth Carolina reported its first two COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday as local governments in several higher-populated areas ordered their residents to stay at home. Gov. Roy Cooper says additional state directives are coming to slow the virus spread.\n\nCooper announced the coronavirus-related deaths were a person from Cabarrus County and another person from Virginia who was traveling through the state. The Cabarrus County patient was over 70 years old with underlying conditions, while the Virginia patient was over 60, according to a news release, which did not include further details about them.\n\nThe deaths came as overall positive cases of the virus reached more than 500 statewide, according to a state tally Wednesday. About 30 people were hospitalized, authorities said, and some were in critical condition.\n\n\u201cToday is a stark reminder that we must take this disease seriously \u2014 all of us, young and old, employers and employees,\" Cooper said at a news conference while asking for privacy for the families of those who died. \u201cThis virus can be deadly, and that's why our daily lives have had to change so dramatically. I know it's hard, but it's necessary.\u201d\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nMore local governments announced stay-at-home orders on Wednesday, including the cities of Durham and Winston-Salem; Buncombe County in the Asheville area; and Greensboro and surrounding Guilford County. Mecklenburg County announced one on Tuesday that takes effect Thursday morning.\n\nWake County, which includes Raleigh and ranks No. 2 in population behind Mecklenburg, planned to roll out a similar order very soon, said county commission Chairman Greg Ford.\n\nNorth Carolina government has not issued a statewide shelter-in-place order but has gradually reduced allowable gathering sizes, ordered some nonessential businesses to close starting Wednesday and shuttered K-12 schools until mid-May. Trade groups representing hospitals and doctors have written Cooper asking him to issue more statewide restrictions.\n\nWithout giving specifics, Cooper said further guidance and orders would be upcoming. He urged people to stay at home and businesses to get their telecommuting options in order.\n\n\u201cLocal communities are doing what they think is right and I understand that. It's important for (state officials) to make sure we are deliberate and that we get this right,\" Cooper said. \u201cWe will be issuing additional orders soon.\u201d\n\nDurham Mayor Steve Schewel said at a Wednesday news conference that the city's order covering more than 265,000 residents goes into effect Thursday and lasts through the end of April. Similar to other jurisdictions, the order includes exemptions for people going to get food or medicine or completing other essential tasks. Schewel said Durham County has 74 cases, including at least eight cases of community spread. The area ranks among the counties with the most cases in the state.\n\n\u201cWhat we know about this virus is that it spreads easily and fast,\" he said. \"Once cases begin multiplying, as they have in Italy and New York, the rise in the number of cases is exponential. And that is exactly what we are trying to avoid and to stop here in Durham.\u201d\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nThe tighter restrictions came as General Assembly members held their first formal meeting to determine what lawmakers can offer to buttress the state's response. GOP House Speaker Tim Moore created four COVID-19 working groups, led by both Republicans and Democrats, that could recommend bills to the full legislature when it reconvenes.\n\nThe annual session is set to begin April 28, but there's been talk that the governor would call lawmakers back sooner. Cooper has said his administration is compiling legislative action and spending requests. Moore and one House colleague were the only members to attend the economic work group meeting in person at the Legislative Building, with the rest participating by video conference.\n\nThe speaker said chamber leaders were looking at ways to reduce the spreading threat should they reconvene. Moore said one way would be to expand the time period to complete floor votes, currently 15 seconds for the House, to an hour, so that members can avoid close contact with each other. The state constitution requires a majority of legislators in a chamber be \"actually present\" to complete public business.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented time in our state, and it's an unprecedented time here at the legislature,\" Moore said, adding that his chamber is prepared to convene before late April if necessary.\n\nGOP Senate leader Phil Berger and Minority Leader Dan Blue said Wednesday in a joint statement that fellow senators would collect ideas with a goal of coming to a consensus with Cooper and the House on \"how to help all North Carolinians.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Robertson at www.twitter.com\/GaryDrobertson and Drew at www.twitter.com\/JonathanLDrew","category":"deaths","population":12305.0}

We\u2019ll continue to regularly update it. Any new information will be added below and included in our daily newsletter.\n\nLatest: North Carolina has reported three deaths associated to COVID-19.\n\nAll city and county residents are now ordered to stay at home. The order is effective until April 16.\n\nKnown Mecklenburg County cases: 204. Mecklenburg has the highest count out of all counties in N.C.\n\nKnown North Carolina cases: 636, according to N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. The state identified its first case on March 3.\n\nDeaths: 2 deaths associated with coronavirus. A Cabarrus County person in their late 70s with underlying medical conditions died on March 24. A Harnett County person in their late 30s with an underlying medical condition has also died.\n\nAnother person died in North Carolina while traveling through from Virginia. \u201cIt\u2019s with a heavy heart that I must tell you these will not be our last,\u201d Governor Roy Cooper said.\n\nStay at home order: The order requires residents to stay at home except for when they need to leave for \u201cessential needs\u201d such as grocery shopping, picking up prescriptions, going to a restaurant to pick up takeout orders, running or walking outside, or caring for a family member. Farmers\u2019 markets, ABC stores, and Uber\/Lyft are still allowed to be in operation.\n\nThe county attorney says that violators of the order could be convicted of Class II misdemeanor.\n\n\u201cThe higher level of compliance we get with this proclamation, the shorter it will be,\u201d said county manager Dena Diorio on Tuesday shortly after the order was announced.\n\nSchool closures: On March 23, Cooper issued an executive order closing all public schools statewide for in-person instruction until May 15. The order also bans mass gatherings of 50 or more people, and temporarily closes gyms, movie theaters, barber shops, massage therapy salons, nail salons, and hair salons, for 30 days, starting March 25 at 5 p.m.\n\nCommunity spread: County officials said for the first time last week that there was community spread locally \u2014 meaning they don\u2019t know the source of the infection. Roughly one-third of the cases in Mecklenburg County are from community spread, officials said Monday.\n\n\u201cWant to emphasize that we have community spread,\u201d County Health Director Gibbie Harris said. \u201cEveryone should take it very seriously.\u201d\n\nMore testing, more cases: The rise in known cases also reflects an increase in testing. The state says that it has completed 12,910 tests, which includes both state labs and reporting hospital and commercial labs.\n\nAccording to data the county released Sunday night, about half of reported cases were adults ages 20 to 39; one case was a person under 19. The zip codes 28277 and 28205 \u2014 which include Ballantyne and Plaza Midwood\/Noda, respectively \u2014 each have six or more known cases, according to the county.\n\nState of emergency: Mecklenburg County is under a state of emergency, following a similar declaration by the state on March 10. In a local executive order March 16, Harris said all gatherings with more than 50 people are prohibited.\n\nZoom out: COVID-19, or just \u201ccoronavirus,\u201d started in Wuhan, China in early December. Coronavirus is actually a large family of viruses that cause illnesses, including the common cold, MERS, and SARS. This present strain is new to humans, meaning we needed new tests and still need a new vaccine, which could take a year or longer.\n\nGlobal impact: On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Total cases are now more than 492,000 cases across 171 countries. At least 19,000 people have died and more than 111,000 patients have recovered.\n\nUnited States: On March 13, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency.

Always be sure to call first.\n\nHelp someone get necessary supplies.\n\nYou can only go to work if you\u2019re listed as an essential employee under the order. This includes medical providers, first responders, law enforcement, grocery store employees, food workers, journalists, and more. If you have questions about what this means for you, call the county help line at 704-353-1926.\n\nRestaurant and school closures: Last week, restaurants and bars in North Carolina closed for dine-in customers, following a new executive order from Governor Roy Cooper. They are to remain closed until at least March 31.\n\nTakeout and delivery orders are still allowed. Cooper\u2019s order also includes an expansion of unemployment benefits to help North Carolina workers affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nOn March 17, Atrium, Novant, and Wake Forest Baptist announced that non-essential surgeries, procedures and ambulatory appointments are to be rescheduled.\n\n\u201cRescheduling these appointments will minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 among patients, visitors and healthcare providers,\u201d the hospitals said in a joint statement.\n\nVisitor limits: On Monday, Novant announced a limit on the number of visitors to two per patient. On Wednesday, Atrium Health said that only \u201cessential visitation\u201d will be allowed for now. That includes visitors to patients who are minors, or who are in the intensive care unit.\n\nFull Agenda story: Charlotte hospitals are preparing for war against coronavirus\n\nCourts: Most cases and hearings in North Carolina will be postponed for at least 30 days.\n\nNorth Carolina Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley announced the change at a news conference Friday.

Here are some details about their plans:\n\nAmerican Airlines, the dominant airline at Charlotte\u2019s airport, is reducing its international capacity by 75 percent from March 16 to May 6. The carrier anticipates its domestic capacity in April will be reduced by 20 percent over last year; in May, it\u2019ll be reduced by 30 percent. Out of Charlotte, American is suspending flights to a number of overseas destinations, including to London Heathrow Airport.\n\nDelta Air Lines plans to reduce international flights between 20-25 percent, and trim domestic flights by 10-15 percent.\n\nUnited is suspending travel to certain markets, including Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.\n\nAmerican, Delta, and United are all dropping change fees on flights through May 31.\n\nTrain: There are no restrictions to travel on Amtrak. The railroad network, which has a stop in Charlotte, has scaled back approximately 40 percent of trains in the Northeast due to low demand.\n\nHow are schools responding?\n\nCMS closed: In an executive order March 23, Cooper closed all public schools in North Carolina \u2014 including CMS \u2014 May 15. Cooper still wants teachers, staff, and administrators to get paid for the time.\n\nUniversities: All UNC System institutions, including UNC Charlotte, have moved classes online. Many other colleges have closed campuses and moved to distance learning.\n\nNo sports: The NCAA canceled its men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments and March Madness. The ACC also canceled the remainder of its 2019-2020 season athletic events.\n\nFull Agenda story: What\u2019s the current status of schools in Charlotte?\n\nIs public transportation still running?\n\nYes. Public vehicles are already cleaned daily, but the outbreak has prompted officials to take extra precautions. This is the city\u2019s new contamination protocol for all 304 busses and 83 vans:\n\nCrews are cleaning surfaces with a bleach solution.\n\nA disinfectant fogger will be used on all 42 light rail vehicles.\n\nBus drivers and train operators are receiving latex gloves, hand sanitizer, and soap, too.\n\nStarting Wednesday, public transportation on CATS will be free. Both buses and the light rail will operate on a reduced schedule.\n\nWhat\u2019s the impact on big events in Charlotte?\n\nSports: All major leagues currently in season have suspended games until further notice, including the Charlotte Hornets, Charlotte Checkers, Wells Fargo Championship, and more.\n\nBlumenthal: All of the Blumenthal Performing Arts\u2019 public events have been suspended until April 12 in response to Governor Cooper\u2019s executive order. This includes Belk Theater, Booth Playhouse, McGlohon Theater, Knight Theater, and more.\n\nBank of America Stadium: The Rolling Stones have postponed their Charlotte concert, originally scheduled for July 1 at the stadium. The Billy Joel concert originally scheduled for April 18 has been postponed until April 17, 2021.\n\nReligious services: In response to Cooper\u2019s order, the bishop of the Diocese of Charlotte has mandated that Catholic churches immediately cancel all public Masses. Elevation similarly canceled all in-person services, and is encouraging attendees to participate online instead. Temple Beth El, the largest synagogue in the Carolinas, has closed its building. It\u2019s conducting live-streaming worship instead.\n\nCharlotte Convention Center conferences: Many large conferences are canceled or rescheduled. Local retailer, Girl Tribe has postponed its March 28 pop-up event at the convention center until June 13. It\u2019ll still host a \u201cVirtual Girl Tribe Pop Up Shopping Event\u201d online March 28, though.\n\nThe Foundation for the Carolina cancelled its big annual luncheon on March 25. It\u2019ll still honor sponsorship commitments, which were as much as $5,000 per table.

Randall.\n\nThe Loudoun Board of Supervisors is expected to formally ratify the declaration at its next business meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 5 p.m., the county government said.\n\nThe local declaration of emergency relaxes formal procurement requirements to allow Loudoun County to more easily acquire any goods or services needed to assist in the response to the threat posed by the coronavirus. The declaration also modifies normal employment rules so that employees can be reassigned to county operations involved in response activities.\n\nA local declaration of emergency is sometimes a requirement for residents and businesses to obtain financial aid and emergency loans offered by the federal or state governments.\n\n\n\n\"It is critical that we remove any barriers to the county's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Randall said in a statement. \"This declaration will give us more flexibility as we respond in the coming days, weeks and months to this public health threat.\"\n\nThe declaration of a local emergency in Loudoun follows the declaration of a statewide emergency from Virginia Gov.

In fact, the hospital employs \u201can infection preventionist\u201d and the staff trains to respond to all kinds of different health hazards.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we do all the time,\u201d she said.\n\nWoolley said the hospital assembled a task force made up of medical professionals, public health staff, emergency management, the Navy and others to plan and prepare. Hospital officials are in daily contact with the Island County Health Department, the state Department of Health and other agencies to keep up to date on what\u2019s happening.\n\nThe hospital conducts drills on how to isolate patients and collect specimens. Cleaning efforts have been increased and extra supplies have been ordered. Staff members watch webinars and listen to podcasts about the disease.\n\nThe hospital has trained a range of providers and staff on screening questions, which Woolley said is one of the most vital parts of the response.\n\nWoolley explained people shouldn\u2019t expect to see tents set up outside or many of the other visuals from pandemic movies. Even if the coronavirus does spread to Whidbey Island, most people will get only mildly ill and won\u2019t need to be hospitalized.\n\n\u201cBut we are certainly prepared if patients require hospitalization,\u201d she said, explaining that the hospital has airborne isolation rooms which are used for other infections.\n\nDoctors and nurses at the hospital aren\u2019t wearing hazmat suits but are following the normal precautions for dealing with people who have respiratory symptoms. Woolley explained that the hospital follows guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nIn addition, she said the CDC sets the parameters for when patients are tested for coronavirus.\n\nA patient becomes a \u201cperson under investigation\u201d and is tested if he or she has certain respiratory symptoms and recently traveled to a country with an outbreak; was in close contact with someone who tested positive; or is hospitalized without a different explanation for the illness.\n\nThe swabs may be a little uncomfortable, Woolley cautioned, since they have to go fairly deep into the nose and the back of the throat.\n\nFor accurate information about the coronavirus, the hospital advises people to check out the Washington State Department of Health website at www.doh.wa.gov\/Emergencies\/Coronavirus, the CDC website at\/www.cdc.gov\/coronavirus\/2019-ncov\/index.html or and the website for the World Health Organization at \/www.who.int\/emergen\u2026\/diseases\/novel-coronavirus-2019.\n\nThis story originally appeared in the Whidbey News-Times, a sister publication to The Herald.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":78801.0}

{"state":"Washington","county":"San Juan","publish_date":43913.0625,"url":"https:\/\/www.sanjuanjournal.com\/news\/new-orders-for-san-juan-county-courts\/","title":"New orders for San Juan County courts","text":"Submitted by San Juan County Courts\n\nOn Friday, March 20, the Washington Supreme Court issued a new emergency order outlining required procedures in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. As our state\u2019s highest court, the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s order is binding on San Juan County courts. In response to this new directive, San Juan County Superior and District Courts have amended their emergency orders to postpone almost all in-person proceedings. Amended orders are posted on the courts\u2019 websites.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court order postpones all civil and criminal jury trials until after April 24. This matches what was already ordered in San Juan County Superior and District Courts. Anyone summoned for jury duty before April 27 will be excused from service.\n\nThe new orders postpone all non-emergency civil matters until after April 24, unless they can be heard without the parties coming to court in person. All infractions and small claims hearings are postponed. Written civil motions that can be filed and considered by the judge without oral argument will still be considered.\n\nEmergency civil matters, like protection order and no-contact order hearings, will still go forward; however, they must be held by telephone. Superior Court is allowing hearings in family law cases to occur by telephone. Adult Drug Court also will continue to occur, but by telephone only.\n\nAll criminal matters where the defendant is not currently held in jail will be postponed until after April 24. For defendants who remain in jail until the case is resolved, some hearings will still be conducted: first appearances, plea hearings, motions, and sentencing hearings will be held, but the court must allow telephone or video conferencing unless it is impossible.\n\nNormally, the court will not change or reduce a defendant\u2019s bail unless circumstances have significantly changed. The San Juan County courts acknowledge that the COVID-19 public health crisis creates a significant change in circumstances. Both Superior and District Courts will hear in-custody defendants\u2019 motions to reconsider bail on short notice.\n\nFor any matters that still need to be filed with the court, both courts now have options available to file documents by email or fax, instead of submitting paper documents to the clerk\u2019s offices.\n\nDue to the number of people facing economic hardship during this crisis, San Juan County District and Superior Courts will not penalize anyone who cannot make payments under court-ordered payment plans. Anyone who misses a payment between March 16 and April 24 will not be found delinquent or in contempt.\n\nFinally, as announced previously, the District Court Clerk\u2019s Office is limiting the hours the front counter is open to the public to between 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Anyone who needs to file a petition for a protection no-contact order can still ring the bell for service during normal business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Anyone who needs to make payments for parking tickets, infractions, or court cases is encouraged to use the payment deposit box.\n\nThe Superior Court Clerk\u2019s Office will remain open, but it has suspended passport acceptance and notary service. Everyone is encouraged to conduct their business by telephone, fax, or email if possible. Anyone\n\nwho comes to the office must remain outside the office so that staff can serve clients one at a time. Payments can be made electronically through OfficialPayments.com, by mail, or put into the Clerk\u2019s drop box outside the door. Clerk\u2019s fees for filing by fax and for presentation of ex parte orders are waived at this time.\n\nSuperior Court Administration and Juvenile Court Services offices are closed to in-person communication. Superior Court Administrator Jane Severin may be reached at 360-370-7480 and JaneS@sanjuanco.com. Juvenile Court Services may be reached at 360-370-7440.\n\nSan Juan County Superior Court, District Court, Juvenile Court Services, and the County Clerk want to provide access to the courts while acknowledging the severity of the public health crisis we face. It is our duty to minimize all in-person contact as much as we can to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the public, court and clerk staff, attorneys, and parties. We ask for your help to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting your court contact to those matters that are essential at this time.","category":"None","population":15875.0}

To support vital reporting such as this, please consider a digital subscription.\n\nA Whatcom County public health emergency has been declared to reduce the spread of novel coronavirus in the community after the county health department announced on Tuesday afternoon, March 10, that the county had its first confirmed case of COVID-19.\n\nThe person who tested positive is a woman in her 60s who received medical care at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center.\n\nHer condition improved and she was discharged.

He did so in coordination with the Whatcom County Health Board.\n\nDeclaring an emergency facilitates coordination with local and statewide partners, officials said, adding that it helps them provide a comprehensive Whatcom County response to the outbreak.\n\nOn Tuesday, the health department also issued new recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including canceling or postponing non-essential large public gatherings and encouraging businesses to allow their employees to work from home if possible.\n\nIt did not, however, recommend school closures although the department noted that decision is up to school districts in Whatcom County.\n\nThe Whatcom County Health Department was working aggressively to identify all those who may have come into contact with the woman who had the first confirmed case of COVID-19 here, officials said.\n\nClose contacts may include family members, co-workers, emergency responders and others. Once identified, they will be closely monitored for symptoms to avoid further spread, the health department said.\n\n\u201cWe understand that news of this first confirmed case in our community creates fear and uncertainty. Our public health team is working intensively to investigate the case, identify close contacts, and coordinate with our medical and community partners to protect public health,\u201d said Dr. Greg Stern, Whatcom County Health Officer, in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly thankful for the Whatcom County medical community, which has been in close communication with us about evaluating specific patients and implementing evolving guidelines,\u201d Stern said.\n\nDespite the additional measures people are being asked to take after the first confirmed case, Wolpers said that the risk to the public was still relatively low, though increasing.\n\nTo become infected by the virus that causes COVID-19, he said that people have to be in close contact with someone who is sick with the illness. That\u2019s someone who lives in the same home, is caring for someone who is sick, is within six feet of someone sick with COVID-19 for about 10 minutes, or is in direct contact with respiratory droplets from someone who is ill.\n\nOtherwise, you\u2019re at low risk for infection, Wolpers said.\n\nHealth recommendations\n\nSo what should Whatcom County residents do now?\n\n\u201cWe know that this is a difficult time for our community and these recommendations will significantly impact our daily lives,\u201d Stern said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to make these recommendations was made based on the best public health science, which tells us that these actions are needed to reduce further transmission of disease in our area.\u201d\n\nThe steps people are being asked to take are based on the increasing risk of the spread of COVID-19, Whatcom public health officials said, and match similar recommendations made by other health departments in the region.\n\nThey include:\n\n\u25aa People who are at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places where there are a lot of of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. This includes concert venues, conventions, sporting events and crowded social gatherings.\n\nPeople who are at higher risk include those who are older than 60; have underlying health conditions that include heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; have weakened immune systems; and who are pregnant.\n\n\u25aa As for public gatherings, officials said to avoid bringing together large groups of people \u2014 loosely defined as 10 to 50 people or more \u2014 if possible.\n\n\u201cRealistically there is no magic number,\u201d Cindy Hollinsworth, the communicable disease and epidemiology manager for the health department, said Tuesday in the briefing. \u201cThe larger the group, the higher the risk of spreading illness.\u201d\n\n\u25aa Employees who can\u2019t work from home should minimize their interaction with large groups of people.\n\nPersonal steps\n\nCounty residents also are being asked to take these measures to help keep the respiratory illness from spreading:\n\n\u25aa If you\u2019re sick, stay home.\n\n\u25aa If you\u2019re sick with a cough and fever, don\u2019t go back to work until 72 hours after your fever has gone away or seven days after the illness began, whichever is longer.\n\nEmployers are being urged to maximize their flexibility in sick leave benefits to accommodate these measures.\n\n\u25aa If you\u2019re sick with respiratory symptoms \u2014 coughing or sneezing \u2014 wear a mask when in public.\n\n\u25aa Don\u2019t go to emergency rooms or urgent care clinics if your illness is mild, so that health care providers can help those who have the most critical needs. Limiting unnecessary visits also protects health care workers and other patients from infection.\n\n\u25aa Even if you are feeling well, avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities or nursing homes. If you must go to those places, check the facility\u2019s rules for visitors before showing up, don\u2019t stay for too long, and keep at least six feet between you and patients at all times.\n\nOn Tuesday, Skagit County also reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a resident there.\n\nSkagit County Public Health said the person was a woman in her 40s who was in isolation at home, adding that she appeared to have acquired COVID-19 through community transmission.\n\nMore than 118,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 4,200 deaths as of Tuesday evening, March 10, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States has more than 972 confirmed cases with at least 28 deaths.\n\nAbout coronavirus\n\nCOVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, is the name of the illness that first appeared in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, before spreading to other countries, including the U.S. It is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe disease is spread through contact between people within 6 feet of each other \u2014 what\u2019s referred to as close contact \u2014 especially through coughing and sneezing that expels respiratory droplets that land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it\u2019s possible to catch COVID-19 by touching something that has the virus on it, and then touching your own face, \u201cbut this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\u201d\n\nSymptoms \u2014 cough, fever, difficulty breathing \u2014 may occur two days to two weeks after exposure.

Information is from the Yakima Health District, the governor's office and state health officials. To submit a question, email news@yakimaherald.com.\n\nWhat\u2019s the latest on cases in Yakima County?\n\nYakima County had 44 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday. The Yakima Health District also reported the first death related to COVID-19 on Monday in Yakima County was an elderly resident of an unnamed long-term care facility.\n\nFrom Friday to Sunday, the case count in Yakima County increased by approximately 150%, with about one-quarter of these cases among health care workers, the health district said. The local health district and the Washington State Department of Health are now investigating COVID-19 in two local long-term care facilities.\n\nCases of COVID-19 have been confirmed across the entire county and there is evidence of continued community spread, the health district said. All individuals with cough and fever symptoms should assume they have COVID-19 and stay at home.\n\nTesting in Yakima County has been focused on health care workers and those who are severely ill.\n\nWhat about the stay-at-home orders?\n\nThe Yakima Health District issued a stay-at-home order Sunday night. Gov. Jay Inslee followed with a statewide order on Monday.\n\nThe orders require that every Yakima County resident stay at home at all times except to obtain groceries, food and\/or other necessities, to go to medical appointments, to pick up medical prescriptions or to go outside for exercise. Any time people go into public, they must ensure 6 feet of space between themselves and another person.\n\nState health officials say the crisis has impacted every county in the state. People need to heed the precautions for the next two weeks, and the order could be extended beyond that if needed.\n\nYakima Health District spokeswoman Lilian Bravo said the main distinction between the two orders is that the statewide order is for two weeks, while the county order is indefinite due to the vulnerability of the local health care system and recent closure of Astria Regional, leaving the city of Yakima with only one hospital.\n\nWhat authority does the Yakima Health District have?\n\nRCW 70.05.070 says the local health officer has the authority to \u201ccontrol and prevent the spread of any dangerous, contagious or infectious diseases that may occur within his or her jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nDr. Teresa Everson said the order is aimed at saving lives.\n\nCORONAVIRUS The latest on what we know about the virus outbreak, the efforts to fight it, and what you need to know to keep you and your family safe. Click Here\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 has the potential to overwhelm our health care system,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThis is a system that was already stressed with a recent hospital closure. Ultimately, the intent of this health order is simple: save lives by slowing the spread of disease.\u201d\n\nCan I go outside? Can my kids play outside?\n\nYes and yes. You can go outside for exercise, but you should maintain a social distance of 6 feet from others. It\u2019s OK to go for a walk or hike, walk a dog or ride bicycles.\n\nState officials said it\u2019s fine if a family living together decides to go for a walk or take their children to play outside. However, people should not meet up with another group at a park or somewhere else. The city of Yakima and many area school districts are closing playgrounds to public access.\n\nWhat can stay open?\n\nGrocery stores, food banks, convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, banks, laundromats and laundry services. Restaurants are open for take-out, drive-thru and delivery only. Essential state and government functions will remain open.\n\nThe order also allows jobs that are part of the critical infrastructure sector to continue. That includes health care, emergency services, agriculture\/food, energy, water, wastewater, transportation\/shipping, communications\/IT, child care, manufacturing that supports critical functions, financial and legal services, hazardous material management and construction jobs, according to the health district.\n\nThe state put out a 14-page list of businesses and organizations considered critical infrastructure. Non-essential businesses must close by Wednesday evening. Many businesses can continue operations using telework. For more on the governor's order, click here.\n\nHow will the stay-at-home order be enforced locally?\n\nThe Yakima Health District is relying on all community members and businesses to move forward with the orders as fast as they are able. They are prioritizing education first, enforcement second. The health officer has the authority to partner with local law enforcement and implement municipal fines at the health officer\u2019s discretion. Non-compliance can be reported to 509-249-6508.\n\nState officials said that police initially do not intend to go out and make arrests. They will disperse crowds. However, a violation of the state order is a gross misdemeanor. Authorities could get to a point where arrests could occur.\n\nYakima County Sheriff Bob Udell said Tuesday deputies do not plan to arrest, cite or detain people who are not in compliance. Law enforcement will instead aim to engage and educate those not following the rules.\n\n\"Law enforcement is here to help the community,\" he said, adding that there were no plans to mobilize the National Guard, except to potentially help with hauling supplies.\n\nStaff reporters Phil Ferolito and Janelle Retka contributed to this article.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":247044.0}

Each is recovering from the virus at home, according to the health district. They were not hospitalized.\n\nCommunity transmission of the respiratory virus \u2014 which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic Wednesday \u2014 was \u201clikely increasing at this time,\u201d the Yakima Health District said.\n\nAndre Fresco, executive director of the Yakima Health District, said social distancing is recommended. He said while the health district fully supports event cancellation, it was not mandating any.\n\nThe number of people tested in the county was not immediately available.\n\nCOVID-19 is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2, which is part of the same family as the flu and common cold. Primary symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. These usually appear two to 14 days after exposures.\n\nMost people experience only mild symptoms. But some people develop more severe symptoms like pneumonia, which can be fatal. This is most common in those with preexisting conditions.\n\nTwo confirmed cases\n\nThe two patients with confirmed cases of the coronavirus were identified after coming in contact with a woman from Kittitas County who tested positive, as announced March 7. The woman attended an event at the Yakima Square & Round Dance Center in Moxee.\n\nThe eight people potentially exposed were self-isolated and tested for the virus. Two results came back positive, five came back negative and the last test is still awaiting results.\n\nThe district intends to contact individuals identified as having been in close contact with the two patients.\n\n\u201cWhile these are the first confirmed cases in our county, community transmission of COVID-19 is likely increasing at this time,\u201d Teresa Everson, a health officer at the health district, said in the release. \u201cAs we see the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continue to increase in Yakima County and across the state in the next few weeks, it is important for everyone who feels sick, in any way, to stay home.\u201d\n\nThe patients are among at least 457 confirmed cases statewide Thursday, according to the state Department of Health. The number climbed from 366 Wednesday. There had been 31 deaths as of Thursday.\n\nCORONAVIRUS The latest on what we know about the virus outbreak, the efforts to fight it, and what you need to know to keep you and your family safe. Click Here\n\nLocal scene\n\nFresco of the health district said it was difficult to determine the number of labs available in the county because there were several commercial labs now testing for the virus. He emphasized that the area was fully supplied with test kids, but could not provide the number.\n\nPrimary care providers throughout the county are able to conduct coronavirus testing, but individuals who show mild symptoms are advised to stay home and take care of themselves \u2014 there\u2019s no vaccine and limited hospital capacity.\n\nThere were at least two commercial labs able to process the tests in Yakima County as of Thursday, according to reports from local medical experts.\n\nCommunity Health of Central Washington\u2019s network has tested \u201ca handful of people,\u201d while Yakima Neighborhood Health Services declined to provide a number. The Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, which launched its own testing lab last week, tested about three dozen patients Thursday alone.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people have been tested countywide.\n\nLori Kelley, Farm Workers\u2019 senior director of quality and patient safety, emphasized that all patients were welcome regardless of ability to pay or citizenship status. She asked that patients call ahead so the network could take potential coronavirus cases through separate doors or meet them to avoid infecting healthy patients.\n\nIndividuals are advised to stay home and self-isolate if they show symptoms, unless conditions grow serious \u2014 such as shortness of breath or trouble breathing, said Dr. Michael Schaffrinna, chief medical officer of Community Health of Central Washington.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sick, stay home because testing is not going to change what we do with you,\u201d he said, emphasizing that there\u2019s no treatment for the virus.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, the test has a high rate of false negatives in patients who show mild symptoms, which is the most common experience \u2014 meaning they could be falsely reassured that they don\u2019t have the virus, and continue transmitting it if not in isolation.\n\nThe best protection against the spread of the virus is to practice diligent hygiene, frequently disinfect surfaces and stay home when sick, Kelley said.\n\n\u201cCertainly we\u2019re all one community and this affects all of us, so we want to be sure we\u2019re putting the word out to everyone in the spirit of creating a culture of health for our community,\u201d she said.\n\nMoving forward\n\nLocal health experts are continuing to plan in response to the arrival of the virus.\n\nAsked if the former Astria Regional Hospital building might be used to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 or to host medical providers, an Astria Health official said the organization had a meeting scheduled with local officials next week \u201cto discuss possible uses of the closed facility.\u201d\n\nCHCW\u2019s Yakima Pediatrics is launching a car-side triage to evaluate children Friday morning in response to a high volume of calls that outpace in-clinic capacity, said Schaffrinna. The services will allow providers to assess children and determine appropriate care, including potential coronavirus testing, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of if, but when we offer that at each of our sites,\u201d he said of car-side services.\n\nYakima Neighborhood Health Services operated as usual, according to communication director Leah Ward.\n\nMore information is available at the Yakima Health District website at https:\/\/www.yakimacounty.us\/2323\/Human-Coronavirus.\n\nThe Washington State Department of Health also has a hotline open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. to answer calls about the coronavirus.

At a recent Egg Harbor village plan commission meeting, several people remarked \"we don't know if we'll even have a tourist season.\"\n\nThe summer brings in thousands of tourists to the area, and millions of the dollars to the county's economy, but people fear the pandemic will still be in full force as the weather warms, prohibiting visitors.\n\nDeclaring the state of emergency means the county will make it a priority to provide necessary resources to combat the pandemic.\n\nBoth the U.S. and Wisconsin declared a public health emergency last week.\n\nDoor County also implemented two temporary administrative orders. One grants employees impacted by COVID-19 additional paid time-off days. Parents of children attending any of the county schools \u2014 all of which are closed until April 6 under state orders \u2014 could take extra days off for this reason.\n\nThe other, the Employee Travel Administrative Order, restricts local government employees from traveling out-of-state. The county advised employees to cancel out-of-state trips. Employees returning from traveling must self-quarantine and stay away from their work site for 14 days.\n\nIf people travel out-of state before midnight on Wednesday, they can use extra work leave hours granted under the original ordinance in order to isolate. But if they travel after they date, they cannot use additional work leave hours but can work remotely if an employer grants permission.\n\nPublic safety employees are not covered by the travel order. The order urged meetings and other events be held virtually whenever possible to practice social distancing. Both are subject to change and will be lifted as the pandemic improves.\n\nThe County Board will hold an emergency meeting at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, at which time county leaders will provide more updates, according to County Administrator Ken Pabich.\n\nContact Sammy Gibbons at (920) 431-8396 or sgibbons@gannett.com.

This, with seven COVID-19 related deaths reported in Milwaukee County.\n\nGov. Tony Evers' order, which took effect at 8 a.m. Wednesday, March 25 continues until April 24, though the timeframe could be altered. It closed nonessential businesses, banning gatherings of any size, and imposing month-long travel restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAll public and private gatherings of any number of people who are not in the same family or living unit are prohibited. Evers previously limited gatherings to no more than 10 people.\n\nAnyone who leaves home is required to maintain a 6-foot distance from other people as part of the social distancing effort that health officials say is the only effective way to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nMilwaukee's \"Stay at Home\" order took effect at midnight Wednesday, March 25 -- closing all nonessential businesses. Mayor Barrett noted everyone can still work if their job is essential -- and everyone can get groceries, go to the doctor, even go for a walk if they practice social distancing.\n\n\"The more we can concentrate our efforts-- our community efforts into defeating this -- the faster our normal lives can get back to order,\" Barrett said.\n\nIt's up to local law enforcement to make sure people are obeying the new restrictions. The Milwaukee Police Department issued the following statement:\n\n\"At this time, MPD is still seeking voluntary compliance from our community as we fight COVID-19 together. We have been called to various individuals and business establishments regarding the \"Safer-at-Home\" order. The individuals we have come in contact with have voluntarily complied and\/or dispersed. We will continue to educate our community and enforce the order as needed.\"\n\nAlderman Russell Stamper II and Alderman Khalif Rainey on Thursday issued statements asking that residents please abide by these guidelines.\n\nStamper II added that two of his friends have tested positive for the coronavirus, so this hits home for him.\n\nStatement from Alderman Stamper II:\n\n\"The deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading fast among Milwaukee\u2019s African American population, and it has already claimed the lives of several African American men here. But those deaths \u2013 and a strict citywide Stay-at-Home order \u2013 don\u2019t seem to be getting the attention of enough people in the community. The coronavirus pandemic is deadly serious, and all Milwaukee residents need to start getting the message IMMEDIATELY! In fact, Milwaukee Police have indicated that they will begin enforcing the Stay-at-Home order where needed, especially when they see people congregating and conducting \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d in violation of the order. MPD reports that problems with compliance have been especially bad on the north side, and even in 15th District. To be clear, on Monday (March 23) Milwaukee\u2019s Health Commissioner issued the Stay-at-Home order, imposing a city-wide requirement to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The order took effect early yesterday and will continue to be in effect until it is extended, rescinded, superseded, or amended in writing. During the Stay-at-Home order, all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single household or living unit are prohibited, except for a few limited purposes. Nothing in the order prohibits the gathering of members of a household or living unit. All travel, including, but not limited to, travel on foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit (except Essential Travel and Essential Activities as defined in the order) is prohibited. People riding on public transit (especially MCTS buses) must comply with social distancing requirements to the greatest extent feasible. People are allowed to leave their homes to engage in activities or perform tasks essential to their health and safety, or to the health and safety of their family or household members (including, but not limited to, pets), such as (by way of example only and without limitation) obtaining medical supplies or medication, visiting a health care professional, or obtaining supplies they need to work from home. Residents may also leave their home to obtain necessary services or supplies for themselves and their family or household members, or to deliver those services or supplies to others, such as canned food, dry goods, fresh fruits and vegetables, pet supply, fresh meats, fish, and poultry, and any other household consumer products, and products necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and essential operation of their home. People are allowed to engage in outdoor activity, provided they practice social distancing, and this can include walking, running or hiking. Games of basketball (and soccer) should be avoided because of the physical contact involved, and ALL playgrounds are closed and must be avoided to combat the spread of the deadly virus. People are allowed to leave home to perform work providing essential products and services (as defined in the order) and to care for a family member, friend, or pet in another household, and to transport family members, friends, or pets as allowed by the order. Lastly, residents will be allowed to travel to the polls to vote in the spring election on April 7 (or to work at polling locations or to count ballots). To avoid the need to go to a polling location, residents may still request an absentee ballot online at myvote.wi.gov or by calling 414-286-VOTE. COVID-19 is highly transmissible and is 10 times deadlier than the seasonal influenza! NO ONE is immune and there is no vaccine, and it can be especially deadly for those with underlying medical conditions and issues such as asthma, diabetes, heart and pulmonary disease, cancer patients and anyone 65 or older. I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is for EVERYONE to immediately STAY HOME and comply with the Stay-at-Home order so we can stop the spread of the coronavirus and protect the health of the community.\"\n\nStatement from Alderman Rainey:\n\n\"The global pandemic brought about by COVID-19 has caused the city and state to issue \u201cStay-at-Home\u201d orders to help slow the spread of the virus. Alderman Khalif J. Rainey is urging city residents, particularly those of the 7th District, to take this order seriously and remain at home. \u201cThe orders issued by the city and state this week underscore how serious this health emergency is,\u201d said Alderman Rainey. \u201cI implore all residents to stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary to leave. I particularly want to encourage residents near St. Joseph\u2019s and the Sherman Park area to abide by these orders, as those places have seen the greatest concentration of positive cases.\u201d Beginning Tuesday, March 24th the Ascension SE Wisconsin Hospital - St. Joseph Campus was one of several Ascension sites to start offering drive-thru testing. All drive-thru tests are by appointment only. Individuals who wish to be tested must first be pre-screened by an Ascension Medical Group provider by phone (1-833-981-0711), or virtually using Ascension Online Care (ascension.org\/OnlineCare). The \u201cStay-at-Home\u201d order aims to ensure that the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to slow the spread of the virus. Residents should only leave their home to perform or obtain vital services. Among the businesses that remain open are grocery and supply stores, health care facilities and pharmacies, restaurants (take-out only), child care facilities, auto shops and gas stations. Should someone have to leave their home they should follow the appropriate precautions. Practice proper social distancing and remain six feet apart from other people, remember to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, avoid touching your face, and stay home if you feel sick. The order went into effective at 12:01 a.m. on March 25, 2020 and will continue to be in effect until it is extended, rescinded, superseded, or amended in writing by the Health Commissioner. Those with questions related to COVID-19 can call 2-1-1 to speak with a health care professional Monday \u2013 Friday from 8:00 a.m. \u2013 4:45 p.m. Visit Milwaukee.gov\/coronavirus for the latest news and information.\"\n\nCoronavirus-related deaths in Wisconsin (in chronological order based on when they were reported)\n\nMan in his 50s in Fond Du Lac County: Death confirmed by Gov.
