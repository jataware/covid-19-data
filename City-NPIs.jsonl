Besides the purposes outlined in the ordinance, Birmingham residents are to remain in their homes. The penalty for violating the ordinance is up to 30 days in jail.\n\nThe \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d ordinance goes into effect immediately and stands until April 3 at 12 a.m. According to the city municipal code, a violation of a city ordinance is punishable by up to 180 days in jail and\/or up to a $500 fine.\n\n\u201cWe have to do everything we can to prevent community spread. The ultimate goal is to save lives,\" the mayor told the council. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing, it goes against human nature because we are by definition social creatures. But I am convinced ... if we make the tough hard decisions now and hunker down then the faster we can get back to our normal way of life.\u201d\n\nCouncilor Hunter Williams said the order is \u201cin the best interests of the city of Birmingham.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough decision knowing this will curb the economic landscape within the city of Birmingham, but I think in the long run ... we will have an opportunity to flatten that curve.\u201d\n\nCouncilor John Hilliard said the order is necessary and that he would lose sleep at night if the city stood idly by while the virus spreads. He said Birmingham\u2019s economic health is dependent on its residents\u2019 physical health.\n\n\u201cI love this city and I want it to thrive, but we need people to thrive with it,\" Hilliard said.\n\nSaid Councilor Chrystal Smitherman, \u201cI would rather do the most I can to protect the public and have y\u2019all be mad at us than you getting mad later for us not doing enough.\u201d\n\nA shelter-in-place order would quicken the time for Birmingham to return to normalcy, said Councilor Clinton Woods.\n\n\u201cThe quicker we get through this crisis, the faster we get back to business,\u201d he said. \"We wait another week and [a shelter-in-place order] could be late.\u201d\n\nWoodfin said the rapid rise in cases, and hospitalizations at UAB, requires more stringent rules. The order will not prevent people from leaving their homes. The shelter in place asks residents to only leave their homes for essential purposes like going to the grocery store, doctor or work, Woodfin said.\n\n\u201cWe urgently need the public\u2019s cooperation today. If you haven\u2019t started social distancing, please do so now,\u201d said Sarah Nafziger co-chair, UAB\u2019s Emergency Management Committee.\n\nBirmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin says 45 people with COVID-19 are being treated at UAB. He says 18 of those patients are on a ventilator. \u2014 Anna Beahm (@_AnnaBeahm) March 24, 2020\n\nOfficials with the Jefferson County Health Department were at the press conference and expressed support for the new rules.\n\n\u201cI recognize how big the sacrifice is, but this is our moment. It\u2019s our moment to beat the virus. In order to be able to come out on the other side we have to do this. We will overcome,\u201d said Dr. Wes Willeford with the JCDH.\n\nWoodfin noted that the ordinance is not in conflict with county restrictions on the closures of non-essential businesses and the city is not adding to that list of businesses. Industries that are not on the non-essential list can still open for business, including manufacturing, logistics, supply chain, distribution, construction and law firms.\n\nThe order also allows for solitary exercise activities.\n\n\u201cYou want to run, you want to hike, you want to bike, we encourage you to do that,\" Woodfin said.\n\nCity officials say the goal of the shelter in place ordinance is not to spur large-scale arrests.\n\n\u201cThe intent is not to arrest anyone or put anyone in jail, but there must be a balance to make sure people comply with the law and the health department,\u201d said city spokesman Rick Journey. Journey said Birmingham\u2019s ordinance is not out of line with what other cities have done.\n\nOther cities have enacted \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders. In Birmingham, the city has been under restrictions set by the county health officer and clarified on Sunday night. Fines under state law for violating public health orders can be $500 daily.\n\nUnder this proposal, the penalties available under the municipal code would apply, including a fine up to $500 and\/or up to 180 days in the city jail. (Code 1-1-6 here)\n\nThe mayor told the council, which reconvenes at 4 p.m. to consider the measure, the city needs greater authority to disperse crowds and keep people off the streets.\n\nRelated: \u2018A matter of life and death:\u2019 Jefferson County police to enforce Alabama\u2019s strictest coronavirus orders","category":"shelter_in_place","population":744189.0,"lat":33.5277,"lng":-86.7987}

This includes:\n\nSutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital issued quarantine orders this week to at least 30 of its hospital workers who had contact with a patient with the coronavirus, the largest isolation order publicly reported so far at a single health care facility treating patients with the infectious disease in California, the union representing most front-line hospital staff said Thursday.\n\nThe union revealed the quarantine the same day Sonoma County public health officials announced a second confirmed case of COVID-19 from a local resident seeking care at an undisclosed Santa Rosa hospital. Both people traveled on a February round-trip cruise on the Grand Princess ship from San Francisco to Mexico and returned home on a shuttle from the port to Sonoma County, public health officials said.\n\nSutter officials would not say if the patient who exposed the hospital workers to the coronavirus was either of two cruise ship passengers who are local residents being treated in isolation at a Santa Rosa hospital, or a third passenger from another ship, the Diamond Princess, transferred in February to a local hospital from Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.\n\nThe union issued a statement urging hospitals to protect their workers.\n\n\u201cThe workers aren\u2019t being tested before being sent home,\u201d said Sean Wherley, spokesman with SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. \u201cThey\u2019re sent home but they are potentially exposing their families. It\u2019s not clear how this is limiting the spread.\u201d\n\nSutter executives would not confirm Thursday that employees had been sent home and declined to answer a reporter\u2019s questions, instead issuing a prepared statement through a spokeswoman.\n\n\u201cThe safety of our patients and employees\u201d is top priority, the spokeswoman said. The hospital continues to update our protocols regarding the coronavirus \u201cin accordance with best practices established by federal, state and local authorities.\u201d\n\nThe employees under isolation in the state come from a wide range of positions within the hospitals, \u201canyone from the housekeeper coming into the room without being advised, the phlebotomist drawing the blood, the admitting clerk who was a first point of contact,\u201d Wherley said.\n\nThe union pressed hospitals to develop better communication lines between executives and staff, establish early assessment protocols and ensure facilities have sufficient protective equipment and enough staff on duty.\n\nStatewide, the union estimated at least 50 caregivers had been sent home from jobs at hospitals after they treated or came into contact with patients infected with COVID-19. At least 10 health care workers were taken off the job Feb. 27 at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View and Los Gatos.\n\nAnother 10 workers were isolated Wednesday from Kaiser Permanente in Roseville, where a man who died from the disease had been under care for six days.\n\nTwo workers from Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles were quarantined Tuesday.\n\nWherley, whose union represents 365 workers at Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital, said he had no details about the circumstances of the quarantine in Santa Rosa.\n\n\u201cHospital executives need to collaborate with employees to understand the circumstances: are there supplies in place?

We can deploy the money. We can get people out working,\u201d said Mark Davis, AIDEA\u2019s chief infrastructure investment officer.\n\nThe proposed 200-mile industrial road would access a large, undeveloped copper-zinc mineral belt in Northwest Alaska. Conservation groups and some who live in the region have criticized the project as costly and a potential threat to subsistence resources and the region\u2019s rivers.\n\nDozens of Alaskans called into the meeting to protest the road funding\u2019s inclusion on the agenda. They accused the board of taking advantage of an emergency to bypass the normal public process.\n\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that AIDEA used a global pandemic to funnel money\u201d to the road, said Loren Karro of Palmer.\n\n\u201cSupport things that would sustain the residents of Alaska, not Outside mining interests,\u201d said Zoe Fuller, also of Palmer.\n\nThe Ambler Road issue overshadowed the board\u2019s other work, which included a measure that waives its normal loan-granting procedures and another that immediately provides $50 million to underwrite small loans issued to Alaska businesses by Alaska banks.\n\nThose loans will be available to businesses that already have loans from Alaska banks. Under the AIDEA plan, businesses can ask for additional cash from their bank to cover immediate expenses. In return, AIDEA will shoulder the risk.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to lend irresponsibly to them,\u201d said Butch Olmstead of FirstBank and the Alaska Bankers Association.\n\nBoard members voted to ask the Alaska Legislature for permission to expand the plan to as much as $1 billion. Several legislators said that permission was unlikely because they are planning to leave Juneau within days.\n\nIn related business, the board approved loan relief for BlueCrest Energy, an oil company, and the Blood Bank of Alaska. The blood bank will not have to make payments on an existing loan for six months. The blood bank had requested a nine-month hold and an additional $2.5 million that was not granted. BlueCrest\u2019s request was granted in full: It will have to make only interest payments for a year.\n\nTom Boutin, AIDEA\u2019s executive director, said Alaskans \u201cshould conclude that this board treats every dollar as very, very precious.\u201d\n\nBoard member Bernie Karl owns Chena Hot Springs Resort and said he has already been forced to lay off his staff.\n\n\u201cWhen the public tells us how devastating things are, I had to live that,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Alaskans should expect economic trouble for long after the public health crisis.\n\n\u201cThis recovery is not going to be six months. It\u2019s not going to be a year. It\u2019s going to be several years for this recovery,\u201d he said.","category":"None","population":263.0,"lat":67.0897,"lng":-157.8725}

Another Alaskan, from Petersburg died of COVID-19 a few days ago in Washington state.\n\nAs of Friday, March 27, which was also the 56th anniversary of the 1964 Good Friday earthquake, the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services confirmed that there were 85 people in the state who had tested positive for the virus, most of them self-quarantined outside of hospitals. The list included Anchorage and Joint Base Elmendorf Richardson 39, Fairbanks 13 Ketchikan 12, North Pole 6, Juneau 4 Eagle River\/Chugiak 3, Palmer 3, Sterling 2, and 1 each in Homer, Seward and Soldotna. Girdwood was the only area not previously reporting infections.\n\nState and local government officials have already admonished all Alaskans to do their part by washing hands frequently, keeping hands off of the face, keeping a minimal six feet of space between themselves and others who are not immediate family and swiping down all frequently touched surfaces.\n\nAlso, in effect were statewide mandates for everyone entering Alaska, including residents coming home, to quarantine themselves for 14 days at home. Those battling respiratory infections, even with mild symptoms, are asked to isolate themselves from others and to call ahead if they need medical attention.\n\nA growing number of rural communities were also imposing their own requirement for everyone entering their community to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\nRavnAir confirmed that the carrier denied seats on a RavnAir flight headed for Bethel to two infants with suspected respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, a common respiratory infection among infants and toddlers in that region of Alaska.\n\nA spokesperson for RavnAir said so far, their screening efforts have been successful \u201cas we have prevented nearly 40 passengers who were either at risk or showing signs of illness from flying on our planes and putting others in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\nUnder their screening plan any passenger presenting symptoms associated with COVID-19 who does not have a doctor\u2019s note is not allowed to fly on their planes.\n\nRavnAir said that the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corp. was notified that if they were willing to conduct an assessment via telemedicine and provide possible RSV patients or their parents\/guardians with a doctor\u2019s note explaining that the physician believed the passenger had RSV and not COVID-19 then the patient would be allowed to fly on RavnAir, as long as the patient had a mask on and did not fly on a normally scheduled flight with other passengers.\n\nOne of the new mandates announced on March 27 dictated that only those engaged in essential health care services, public government services and essential business activities are exempt from remaining at their place of residence and practicing social distancing. Everyone is urged to work from home as much as possible and cease participation in public or private gatherings that include non-household members. This includes, but is not limited to weddings, faith gatherings, graduations and funerals.\n\nThe second mandate dictates that all instate travel between communities, whether resident, worker or visitor, is prohibited unless travel is to support critical infrastructure or for critical personal needs. Some small communities may also implement further travel restrictions, the mandate noted.\n\nAlaska legislators and federal officials were also working to provide financial aid to a multitude of people who found themselves suddenly out of work.\n\nThe pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy and life overall in Alaska has been dramatic, the saving grace being that Alaska has huge areas where people can recreate while maintaining a great deal of distance between themselves and others while walking, hiking, ice skating, skiing and engaging in other outdoor activities. All that space is helping those with children home while all schools are closed to get outdoor exercise in a safe manner.\n\nA number of businesses and other entities, from nonprofit entities to religious congregations, were restricting entry to or have closed their facilities, leaving them facing their regular rent space and utility bills with little or no income.\n\nGyms are closed. Many restaurants, coffee shops and other retail establishments are offering take-out or curb service only. Many companies that were counting on another lucrative summer tourism season are now telling workers hired for the season to stay home. Other businesses, including hair salons, where there is close interaction with customers, have been ordered closed. Many people employed in service industry jobs are now without jobs at least on a temporary basis.\n\nAlaska Airlines announced plans to reduce its flight schedule for April and May by 70 percent following historic and unprecedented falloff in demand because of the pandemic.\n\nAirline officials said flight schedules for June and beyond will be based on demand, but they expect reductions will be substantial for at least the next several months.","category":"social_distance","population":2187.0,"lat":60.5348,"lng":-145.6092}

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nThese files come from the Associated Press and were posted by Black Press Media at 9:30 p.m., Wednesday, March 25.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\nSenate unanimously passes $2 trillion economic stimulus package\n\nAlaska Airlines to reduce flights by 70%, cut pay to its CEO and president to zero\n\nSouth Korea has 104 new coronavirus cases, 5 more deaths\n\nTrinidad & Tobago reports first death from virus\n\nSpain extends its state of emergency by 2 weeks until April 11\n\nChina reports 67 new cases, all in recent arrivals from abroad\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Senate on Wednesday passed a $2 trillion economic stimulus package \u2014the largest ever \u2014designed to pump money directly into Americans\u2019 pockets while also shoring up hospitals, businesses and state and local governments struggling against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe $2 trillion price tag is equal to more than half of the $3.5 trillion the federal government expects to collect in taxes this year, and is 9% of the nation\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take care of people,\u201d President Donald Trump said of the legislation during a news conference, vowing to sign the bill immediately when it reaches his desk.\n\nA vote was initially delayed in part by concerns from Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a handful of Republican senators that laid-off low-wage earners in some states might be able to temporarily collect more from the expanded unemployment insurance in the bill than from their original salaries, creating a disincentive to work.\n\nBut Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin earlier Wednesday said most Americans would opt to keep their jobs, adding that the provision was needed to streamline the process of getting aid to workers nationwide.\n\n\u201cOur expectation is this bill passes tonight,\u201d said Mnuchin, who took part in five days of tense, marathon negotiations between congressional Democrats and Senate Republicans.\n\nThe sweeping package will impact a broad swath of American society, with some elements potentially lasting longer than the health crisis.\n\nAlong with providing a one-time direct payout of up to $1,200 for most American adults, the bill includes $500 billion in loans to struggling businesses, $377 billion in loans and grants for small businesses, $150 billion for local, state and tribal governments struggling with a drop in revenue and $130 billion for hospitals.\n\nThe package also blocks foreclosures and evictions during the crisis on properties where the federal government backs the mortgage; pauses federal student loan payments for six months and waives the interest; gives states millions of dollars to begin offering mail or early voting; and provides more than $25 billion in new money for food assistance programs such as SNAP.\n\nThe real test will be whether the House accepts the bill as it is, and can pass it with \u201cunanimous consent,\u201d a procedure usually reserved for small, noncontroversial bills. If a single member comes to the House floor and objects, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., may have to recall House members to Washington for a vote that would draw out the process.\n\nDemocratic and Republican House leaders are hoping to avoid that, but it remains to be seen whether they can. A House vote is scheduled to occur Friday.\n\nAlaska airlines chops flights; CEO and president to receive no pay\n\nSEATTLE \u2014 Alaska Airlines will reduce flights by 70% in April and May and cut pay to its CEO and president to zero through September to conserve cash amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe Seattle-based airline said Wednesday that like other airlines they are seeing demand for flights drop by more than 80% and flight schedules for June and beyond will be based on demand.\n\n\u201cThese actions are unprecedented, but these are truly unprecedented times,\u201d Alaska CEO Brad Tilden said in a news release.\n\nAdditionally, Alaska plans to slash pay by 50% to the president of Horizon Air, and cut it by 20 to 30% for other executives. The company board also will not take their pay. The company has worked with the White House, The Treasury Department, and Congress on a $50 billion aid package for passenger airlines, Tilden said.\n\n\u201cAs we more fully understand the impact of these provisions, we will add to our plans to manage through this change,\u201d he said.\n\nSouth Korea: 9,241 infections, 131 deaths\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 104 new cases of the coronavirus and five more deaths, bringing its totals to 9,241 infections and 131 deaths.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Controls and Prevention said Thursday that 30 of the new cases were linked to recent arrivals.\n\nHealth authorities have been scrambling to prevent the virus from re-entering as an increasing number of South Koreans return from Europe and the United States amid broadening outbreaks and suspended school years.\n\nFrom Friday, the country will enforce 14-day quarantines on South Korean nationals and foreigners with long-term stay visas arriving from the United States. Similar measures have already been applied to passengers arriving from Europe.\n\nSouth Korean Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun on Thursday ordered officials to employ a \u201cno-tolerance\u201d policy on those who disobey quarantines, saying that South Korean nationals would be sued and foreigners would be expelled.\n\nFirst death in Trinidad\n\nPORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad \u2014 Trinidad & Tobago is reporting its first death from the coronavirus.\n\nHealth Minister Terrence Deyalsingh said late Wednesday that the patient was an elderly man with a pre-existing medical condition.\n\nThe twin-island nation of 1.4 million people has more than 50 confirmed cases. The oil- and gas-rich nation shuttered its borders earlier this week and has refused entry to everyone, including Trinidadians now stuck abroad.\n\nSpain: State of emergency extended by two weeks\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s Parliament has voted in favour of the government\u2019s request to extend the state of emergency by two weeks that has allowed it to apply a national lockdown in hopes of stemming its coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe parliamentary endorsement will allow the government to extend the strict stay-at-home rules and business closings for a full month. The government declared a state of emergency on March 14. It will now last until April 11.\n\nSpain\u2019s government solicited the two-week extension after deaths and infections from the COVID-19 virus have skyrocketed in recent days. Spain 47,600 total cases. Its 3,434 deaths only trail Italy\u2019s death toll as the hardest-hit countries in the world.\n\nThe parliament met with fewer than 50 of its 350 members in the chamber, with the rest voting from home to reduce the risk of contagion.\n\nChina says 67 new coronavirus infections, all from recent arrivals\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China\u2019s National Health Commission on Thursday reported 67 new COVID-19 cases, all of which it says were imported infections in recent arrivals from abroad.\n\nOnce again, there were no new cases reported in Wuhan, the central Chinese provincial capital where the coronavirus emerged in December.\n\nAfter a months-long lockdown, Wuhan residents are allowed out of the city but cannot leave Hubei province until April 8. China has started lifting the last of the controls that confined tens of millions of people to their homes.\n\nAs outbreaks escalate in the United States and Europe, China\u2019s ruling Communist Party has declared victory over the epidemic and is relaxing restrictions to revive the economy.\n\nTwo-month-old infant infected in DC\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 District of Columbia health officials announced 48 new positive infections from the coronavirus, including a 2-month-old boy, bringing the total up to 231.\n\nOfficials also announced Washington\u2019s third death from the virus, a 75-year-old woman.\n\nOfficials in Washington have long predicted that infection numbers would spike as testing became more available. Mayor Muriel Bowser has declared a state of emergency, shuttered all schools and ordered all non-essential businesses to close.\n\nWhite House and Capitol tours have been cancelled and the National Zoo, Smithsonian museum network and Kennedy Center have closed. Police have blocked off dozens of streets, bridges and traffic circles to prevent crowds coming to see Washington\u2019s signature blooming cherry blossom trees.\n\nPentagon soldier tests positive\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A U.S. Marine has become the first person stationed at the Pentagon to test positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe Marine has been in isolation at home since March 13, when a member of his immediate family began to show symptoms. The Pentagon said his workspace has been cleaned and a contact investigation is underway.\n\nTwo other defence workers who had visited the Pentagon have tested positive, but they were not assigned to the building.\n\nColorado: Stay-at-home order issued\n\nDENVER \u2014 Colorado Gov. Jared Polis is issuing a statewide stay-at-home order in an attempt to stem the rapid spread of the coronavirus.\n\nPolis said he is taking this \u201cextreme measure,\u201d effective Thursday until April 11 because restrictions taken to date haven\u2019t done enough to reduce the spread of the virus. People should only leave home when they absolutely must, he said, for grocery shopping, to seek medical care or to care for dependents. Polis\u2019 order comes after six Colorado counties issued stay-at-home orders affecting nearly 3 million people.\n\nMore than 1,086 people in Colorado have tested positive for the virus and at least 20 people have died.\n\nPentagon restricts troop movement\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Pentagon has halted for 60 days the movement of US troops and Defence Department civilians overseas as a further measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe stoppage is expected to affect about 90,000 troops scheduled to deploy abroad or to return from abroad over the next two months. Some exceptions are allowed, and the order by Defence Secretary Mark Esper will not stop the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan as called for in last month\u2019s deal with the Taliban.\n\nClarification on NYC self-isolation order\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The White House says New York residents who have left the metro area in recent days should self-isolate for 14 days, clarifying guidance announced Tuesday which had applied to anyone who had visited New York recently.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx issued the new guidance Wednesday from the White House press briefing room, saying it applied to \u201cresidents of the metro area that may have gone to second homes or other places to reside.\u201d\n\nShe says: \u201cWe\u2019ve asked all of them to carefully monitor their temperatures and self-isolate from the communities where they went just to ensure their own health and the health of their communities.\u201d\n\nThe New York metro area is now the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., accounting for more than 50% of all new infections reported in recent days.\n\nVirus prompts truces in Libya, Philippines, other international hot spots\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is welcoming calls by some groups for an immediate ceasefire to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, and says he sees \u201ca clear conscience emerging\u201d that it\u2019s time to concentrate on the war against COVID-19.\n\nHe pointed to communist guerrillas in the Philippines announcing a ceasefire from Thursday to April 15 in response to his appeal, and said he was encouraged to see a truce in Libya between the warring parties \u201cholding with difficulties.\u201d\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric also noted the humanitarian truce called for by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in the country\u2019s northeast to deal with the virus. The group was allied with the United States in the fight against Islamic State extremists.\n\nGuterres said at a humanitarian briefing Wednesday that the Palestinian Authority and Israel have also been able to work together on COVID-19, \u201ceven if we know the extreme division that exists politically between the two.\u201d\n\nHe said U.N. envoys around the world are talking to warring parties about ceasefires and he expressed hope that \u201cit will be possible in Yemen and Syria to make serious progress\u201d to end fighting and tackle the coronavirus.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"None","population":3987.0,"lat":64.9339,"lng":-148.0083}

There\u2019s been no downtime, however. My days are filled with back-to-back conference calls with elected officials, association colleagues, and business leaders, all of whom are doing their best to think creatively and nimbly about how best to prevent a total economic catastrophe during this global pandemic. Here\u2019s a quick update:\n\nPass this bill. Now.\n\nThe United States Senate, after some unfortunate delays, has reached a deal on a $2 trillion relief package to spare the U.S. economy from even greater damage. I thank Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Sen. Martha McSally for their diligence to get a deal done and for their regular and consistent accessibility to Arizona\u2019s job creators.\n\nI know the dollar amount of the bill is stunning. But the response has to be proportionate to the size of the crisis.\n\nMake no mistake: This bill is not a nice-to-have; it\u2019s a must-have, especially if we\u2019re going to prevent a total economic catastrophe.\n\nFor businesses with up to 500 employees, the bill, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) includes about $350 billion in loans that could become forgivable grants to support employer payrolls, mortgages, rents, utilities, paid sick or medical leave, insurance premiums, and other costs to keep a business running.\n\nFor mid- and large-sized companies tattooed by this downturn, like airlines, the bill includes direct economic relief totaling $500 billion through loans and loan guarantees.\n\nThe bill also includes $150 billion for the health care sector; $150 billion for state, local, and tribal governments; expanded unemployment benefits for displaced workers; direct cash support to Americans (up to $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 per couple, and $500 per child); $30 billion in emergency education funding; and other essential elements.\n\nThis bill is the legislative equivalent of declaring World War III on coronavirus.\n\nOnce the bill clears the Senate, we need the U.S. House to act fast. Thankfully, based on the regular conference calls the Chamber membership has been having with Arizona\u2019s House members, our delegation is ready to move quickly and ensure that any final legislation is focused squarely on addressing the crisis at hand, and not using the bill to advance some other unrelated policy goals.\n\nThis bill will be one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the nation\u2019s history. Now is not the time to dawdle.\n\nLegislature comes together\n\nNo one could have guessed back in January that the second session of the 54th Legislature would come to such an abrupt halt. But in the face of a public health emergency, legislative leaders in both parties did the right thing in passing a conservative budget for fiscal year 2021 and closing, at least temporarily, the session.\n\nLegislators have plenty of bills that were sidelined by the quick wrap-up, as well as items that they would have liked to have been included in a budget. The Chamber, along with advocates on behalf of a host of other interests, is in the same boat. There\u2019s always next year, though. Now\u2019s the time to batten down the hatches.\n\nThe Chamber thanks each legislator for reaching a budget agreement, for passing a $55 million COVID-19 relief package, for passing with bipartisan support a bill to ensure Arizona leverages federal health care dollars (the bill, H.B. 2668, was signed by Gov. Ducey on Wednesday) and for ensuring the Legislature has the ability to reconvene the session to adjust to new revenue data or to adopt new public-health-related policies, and even to do so remotely if necessary.\n\nGreater certainty now to avoid confusion later\n\nGov. Doug Ducey deserves credit for issuing an Executive Order that proactively establishes a clear, statewide policy on \u201cessential\u201d services and operations. With this policy in place, businesses and workers alike can proceed with assurance that they won\u2019t have to navigate a patchwork of policies across the state if efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19 have to escalate. The Executive Order takes responsible steps to safeguard the public\u2019s health while doing all we can to ensure the Arizona economy continues to function. It\u2019s a model approach that ensures there is no interruption to essential operations, including to manufacturing and supply chains that are critically important to ensuring store shelves stay stocked and critical parts and supplies get to where they need to go.\n\nRegulatory relief when it\u2019s needed most\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that the Ducey administration has been nimble in ensuring that efforts to protect the public\u2019s health and the economy don\u2019t get tied up in red tape. Regulatory rollbacks have been a theme throughout his entire tenure.\n\nNew rules, for example, allowing alcohol to be ordered with food delivery purchases might seem like a small thing, but for the thousands of restaurant and bar employees across the state who\u2019ve been sidelined by this virus, it could be the difference between survival and collapse.\n\nThe governor also deserves credit for quickly securing approval from the federal government to expand access to medical care for the state\u2019s AHCCCS population, and for moving to exempt certified registered nurse anesthetists from certain regulations.\n\nThe federal government has extended some smart regulatory relief, as well. Credit to the Department of Transportation for waiving the hours of service rules on commercial truck drivers aiding relief efforts, and for extending commercial driver\u2019s licenses that are up for renewal during this crisis. If the trucks aren\u2019t rolling, then the nation will suffer even more.\n\nAs someone who just extracted two kids from an unplanned extended spring break in Los Angeles, I can tell you the freeways there were eerily light on traffic, but the truckers were\u2014and are\u2014still on the job.\n\nCommunications to keep you informed\n\nMake sure you\u2019re up-to-date with the latest perspectives from the business community on the impacts of the coronavirus by being a regular subscriber to the Chamber Business News daily email. Chamber Business News also features a coronavirus resource page that has information for anyone looking for helpful information during this period.\n\nI also encourage you to follow us on Twitter at @azchamber for breaking news and information, as well as for my nightly Skype video show we cobble together in the face of straining bandwidth and a lack of technical expertise that reviews the day\u2019s headlines in a brisk 15-minutes-or-less.","category":"disaster_declaration","population":1454.0,"lat":34.1526,"lng":-112.8642}

On the contrary, this is a time for preparation and precaution, and that is exactly what we are doing.\u201d Jerry Bien-Willner, Paradise Valley Mayor\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been updated to include more information from a press release about closures and restrictions within the town as well as closure of the post office.\n\nParadise Valley Mayor Jerry Bien-Willner has issued a proclamation of emergency to go along with the Town Council\u2019s authorization of the creation of a public meeting plan for remote participation as part of the town\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Town Council gathered in a special meeting March 17 to unanimously approve efforts to provide means and methods to ensure remote participation in town meetings from body members and the public.\n\nFurthermore, the town is taking several actions to curtail in-person services to better align with state, federal and local recommendations regarding COVID-19, according to a press release distributed after the meeting.\n\nOne of such is the closing of the post office at Town Hall per a March 18 decision from Town Manager Jill Keimach. Mailboxes are still available for residents to drop off mail with postage but full service won't be available and residents should go to the Hopi Substation at 8790 E. Via de Ventura in Scottsdale.\n\nMr. Bien-Willner said these efforts are aimed at keeping the public involved in town matters while allowing them to undertake safe practices regarding the spread of COVID-19.\n\nHe also said his declaration of emergency is not based on any information he has heard contrary to what federal and state officials are saying publicly, but rather the need to prepare.\n\n\u201cThis is not a time for panic or fear,\u201d he said during the meeting. \u201cOn the contrary, this is a time for preparation and precaution, and that is exactly what we are doing.\u201d\n\nWith the town in a state of emergency, Mr. Bien-Willner said it would be in better position to receive emergency funds and assistance from federal, state and county sources. He learned this after a conversation with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s office, he said.\n\nSecondly, the mayor said this declaration also allows him the ability to work in consultation with Ms. Keimach to establish the changing guidelines from federal health officials without having to go through meetings and procedures, which could slow response and \u201cjeopardize health and safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a public health expert,\u201d Mr. Bien-Willner said. \u201cWe [the town] don\u2019t have a large public health team but we are very blessed that the state does and certainly the federal government\u2019s Centers for Disease Control. All the best minds in the country are focused on this situation, in fact around the world, and we have a direct pipeline into those folks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be following that advice so this gives us implementation authority to do the things that need to be done. We don\u2019t expect any measures currently that are beyond the scope of what is being discussed publicly.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, which led Gov. Doug Ducey to declare a state of emergency in Arizona on the same day. Since that time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encouraged a nationwide halt of gatherings.\n\nWith these parameters in place, the town decided to follow suit, which led to a call of plans to conduct all town meetings electronically. The town will continue to post agendas online along with instructions on how to participate.\n\n\u201cI know we are all interested in leading by example and the best example we can set is to practice social distancing,\u201d Mr. Bien-Willner said. \u201cWe would have done this already but we also have to follow the law and keep order. That\u2019s another example that we set, that we don\u2019t panic and we don\u2019t become afraid. We go through our business and this is an order of business that we get this resolution in place.\"\n\nTown Attorney Andrew Miller said Ms. Keimach would take the lead on establishing the public meetings plan along with input from himself and Town Clerk Duncan Miller.\n\nAndrew Miller said he believes the three of them can get the plan together quickly and publicize it to the public through the website and PV Alert.\n\nOther actions the town is taking include closing Town Hall and the Public Works Building to the public but still have staff available as they work remotely.\n\nThe town says the police department will be fully operational but foot traffic in the department's building will be limited to the lobby. Furthermore, the town says via a release police will exercise COVID-19 best practices when responding to emergency calls.\n\nThe Municipal Court will remain open but will have limited in-person appearances. There will be 30- or 45-day continuances as well as telephonic appearance options for all court matters. The community room and police auditorium will also be closed until further notice.\n\nThe town will continue to follow the CDC and state on further developments and restrictions regarding COVID-19.

All had underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk.In Maricopa County, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases has risen to 454 cases.Many Tucson businesses will be closing today after Mayor Regina Romero last night issued an order to shutter all non-essential businesses that are not protected from mandatory closure by Gov. Doug Ducey, who has said that Arizona needs to has consistent rules statewide. Romero\u2019s order is effective through Friday, April 17.\u201cAfter consulting with my colleagues on the City Council, the City Manager, City Attorney, medical professionals, small businesses, and other stakeholders, I have determined that these actions are necessary to protect public health,\u201d Romero said. \u201cAlthough these are painful decisions, we have a moral obligation to do what is in the best interest of our residents and protect public health.\u201dRomero said she wished she could do more, but Ducey\u2019s order\u2014which allows grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants (via takeout and delivery), barber shops, beauty parlors, parks, golf courses and other \u201cessential\u201d businesses to remain open\u2014limited how many businesses she could order closed. She asked Tucsonans to stay home and avoid necessary trips and urged Ducey to issue a statewide \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order. \u201cIn the absence of clear statewide direction, we are taking swift action at the local level to protect the health and well-being of Tucsonans,\u201d Romero said. \u201cWe cannot afford to wait any longer; COVID-19 is not waiting and neither can we. If Gov. Ducey is unwilling to take decisive action at the state level, then he needs to untie the hands of local jurisdictions and allow us to make decisions that are best for our individual communities. This is particularly critical with respect to the operations of \u2018personal hygiene\u2019 and other services that conflict with CDC social distancing guidelines and could jeopardize public health.\u201dHealth and government officials have urged the public to avoid unnecessary trips and gatherings of more than 10 people. They warn that the extremely contagious virus is rapidly spreading in the community. Symptoms can take up to 14 days to appear, so people can pass COVID-19 without realizing they have been infected with it. Some people remain entirely asymptotic but are carriers.In Oro Valley, Mayor Joe Winfield extended closures of bars, gyms, theaters and other places where people gather through the end of the declared statewide emergency. As in other communities, restaurants remain open for take-out and delivery.In addition to extending that mandate, Winfield\u2019s latest amendment also closed playgrounds, basketball courts, fenced dog parks and other amenities in the town and strongly urged personal hygiene businesses to close. He also suspended regulation on temporary signs to aid businesses that remain open.\u201cThe Town Council understands that this unprecedented situation is significantly impacting many of our local businesses,\u201d said Winfield in a statement. \u201cSuspending enforcement of the temporary sign code in our commercial corridors is one meaningful way we can try to help businesses that have modified operations to let our residents know they are open for business. I hope the community will continue to patronize these places, as appropriate, during this emergency.\u201dThe Pima County Board of Supervisors on Thursday voted 3-2 to extend its own emergency through Friday, April 10. Democratic Supervisors Richard El\u00edas, Sharon Bronson and Ram\u00f3n Valadez voted in favor, while Republican Supervisors Ally Miller and Steve Christy voted against the measure.On Friday, March 20, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman also announced a two-week extension on public school closures, to last until April 10.In the face of the spreading virus, Ducey has also halted to evictions for 120 days; ordered bars, gyms and theaters to be closed in any county with confirmed COVID-19 cases; halted all elective surgery to keep hospital beds available for COVID-19 patients; loosened regulations to make telemedicine more available and increase eligibility for AHCCCS, the state's Medicaid program; and activated the National Guard to assist in grocery stores as Arizonans clear the shelves.Arizona's schools remain closed at least through April 10. Schools are transitioning to online learning and districts across the region are delivering lunch and breakfast meals to kids via school buses or setting up central locations.Courts have rescheduled most hearings to avoid spreading the virus.COVID-19 symptoms typically occur two to 14 days after exposure, and include headache, fever, cough, and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. However, some cases of the virus are entirely asymptomatic. Practices to avoid infection include social distancing (of at least six feet), washing your hands, avoiding unnecessary trips and not touching your face. COVID-19 can survive on cardboard for up to 24 hours, and on stainless steel and plastic surfaces up to three days.If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19 and develop a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, speak with a healthcare provider for medical advice. According to the CDC, people who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to recover at home. Stay at home and avoid public transportation, but stay in touch with your doctor. If you do leave your home, wear a facemask and clean your hands often. If you develop more severe symptoms (persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, bluish lips) get medical attention immediately. Your local health authorities will give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":2513.0,"lat":32.8886,"lng":-109.8437}

As resources and access are becoming more limited, residents are now faced with the dilemma of how to provide for themselves as well as their families. Even during normal circumstances, it is not always easy for residents of Tusayan to obtain needed items, as many do not own vehicles and shuttle services are limited to specified days and times.\n\nAdditionally, persons and families in need of extra assistance are usually able to receive supplemental food supplies every third Wednesday of the month through the Tusayan Food Bank. However, the Food Bank has faced extreme shortages since the restrictions have been in place, and are currently unable to obtain supplies, especially personal hygiene items, quickly enough to keep up with the recent increase in demand.\n\nTo combat these issues, Tusayan Council passed a motion to authorize Town Manager Cynthia Seelhammer to spend a maximum of $25,000 in collaboration with non-profits, charities and other public agencies to ensure the well-being of residents during this unprecedented economic situation.\n\nThis would include expenditures on food and hygiene items, transportation assistance, which may include gas vouchers for workers that own vehicles, and delivery services to persons in need due to the suspension of shuttle services into the park.\n\nTesting options limited\n\nThere is also the matter of limited access to COVID-19 testing options for residents.\n\nCurrently, North Country Healthcare has two locations in Flagstaff offering limited testing, as federal restrictions are still in place regarding who is considered eligible to receive tests.\n\nThe Grand Canyon Clinic is a branch of the North Country Healthcare system, however the clinic has yet to receive any test kits. This point was considered by councilmembers to be of extreme concern as cases of infection continue to increase statewide, with one presumed case in Coconino County thus far.\n\nIn response, the council passed a motion to direct town staff to take necessary action to designate the Town Hall as a Point of Dispensing (POD) for the County Health Department once testing options become available. It was determined that it would be essential for testing to be provided in town as soon as possible, as so many residents face transportation issues.\n\nCurrently, individuals interested in testing are being advised to call testing centers beforehand in order to ensure eligibility, and are encouraged to not seek out rides from others to avoid potential exposure. There are currently no private\/in-house testing options for residents, and the use of ambulances for transport to testing centers is strongly discouraged, due to cost and availability issues.\n\nThe town council is currently drafting a pre-emptive Declaration of Emergency to address the financial impact of the COVID-19 related precautions, in order to allow access to the town\u2019s $9 million in savings, should such a measure be deemed necessary. As current state-imposed limits are not enough to provide assistance to the community at this level of need, accessing these funds would allow the town to ensure residents\u2019 utilities, wellness and food needs will continue to be met as the situation continues to impact the community indefinitely.\n\nMore information is available at Tusayan-az.gov and Coconino.az.gov\/covid19","category":"None","population":583.0,"lat":35.955,"lng":-112.1202}

On March 27, 2020, a federal judge ordered that he and another immigrant be released from the Adelanto Detention Facility over COVID-19 concerns. (Al Seib \/ Los Angeles Times)\n\nA federal judge Friday ordered the release of two immigrants from a detention center in San Bernardino County where he said conditions have put them at risk of contracting coronavirus.\n\nIn an emergency temporary restraining order, Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. wrote that Pedro Bravo Castillo and Luis Vasquez Rueda should be freed \u201cforthwith and without delay.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an unprecedented time in our nation\u2019s history, filled with uncertainty, fear, and anxiety,\u201d Hatter wrote. \u201cBut in the time of a crisis, our response to those at particularly high risk must be with compassion and not apathy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Government cannot act with a callous disregard for the safety of our fellow human beings,\u201d he wrote.\n\nBoth residents of Los Angeles County, Castillo and Rueda were detained by Immigration Customs and Enforcement on March 16 and 17, respectively, according to court filings. At the time, widespread restrictions over COVID-19 were already in place across California, from shuttered businesses to the closures of schools serving millions.\n\nOn Wednesday, the men filed a complaint alleging the federal government violated their rights to due process by subjecting them to risks of contracting coronavirus, which has infected more than 100,000 nationwide.\n\nICE did not immediately respond to calls and an emailed request for comment.\n\n\u201cThe public has a critical interest in preventing the further spread of the coronavirus,\u201d Hatter wrote, indicating an outbreak at the Adelanto facility would \u201cendanger all of us.\u201d\n\nAmid the ongoing pandemic, dozens of advocacy groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union have called for the release of migrants at detention facilities and inmates in crowded jails. In Los Angeles County, the sheriff has said at least 1,700 inmates have been released over virus concerns.\n\nThe complaint filed in federal court indicates 58-year-old Castillo has had kidney stones, a hernia and other chronic health issues, and it describes ICE officers holding him \u201cin several enclosed spaces \u2014 a car, a van, small rooms.\u201d\n\nRueda, 23, entered the U.S. illegally when he was 5 years old and attended college as a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, according to court filings.\n\n\u201cDuring his arrest and transport, officers touched him and breathed on him without using masks and confined him in a crowded van with seven other arrestees for an hour and a half,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nAt the Adelanto facility, Rueda was was placed in a dormitory already under quarantine, court filings state. When he was arrested, he had a work injury that \u201cleft him with bruises and bleeding in his eye, which may require surgery,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nBut he has been unable to get medical care at the detention center, which a federal watchdog report once blasted for poor living conditions such as inadequate medical care, nooses found in cells and detainees placed in \u201chandcuffs and shackles\u201d when they shouldn\u2019t be.\n\nCastillo, 58, and Rueda, 23, both have past DUI convictions for which they have served brief jail sentences.\n\nHatter rejected the federal government\u2019s argument that they be kept in custody since no there are no confirmed cases at the Adelanto facility, noting the virus\u2019 highly contagious nature and the possibility of asymptomatic carriers.\n\n\u201cThey are not kept at least 6 feet apart from others at all times,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThey have been put into a situation where they are forced to touch surfaces touched by other detainees, such as with common sinks, toilets and showers.\u201d\n\nSocial visits have been discontinued due to risks of spreading COVID-19. A staff member at the facility said visiting hours are currently open only to attorneys.\n\nWhile Castillo was detained, he expressed concerns about getting infected, according to a statement from the law firm that represented him and Rueda.\n\n\u201cI am afraid for my health. I worry that if we were to get sick in here, they still would not let us out and we would have to stay in here alone and sick,\u201d Castillo said, according to the firm\u2019s statement.","category":"None","population":34066.0,"lat":34.5815,"lng":-117.4397}

The city has already canceled most of its public meetings and planned ceremonies, consistent with Santa Clara County's recommendations to encourage \"social distancing.\"\n\nShikada also introduced numerous measures on Thursday aimed to limit face-to-face customer service interaction between the public and staff, including encouraging residents to call, email or make appointments with staff (the full list of changes is available here).\n\nShikada emphasized in a statement that the city \"will continue to provide essential services and community support through thoughtful planning for several impact scenarios during this time of heightened public health risk.\"\n\n\"This is a fast-changing situation, and service changes may continue to evolve,\" Shikada said in the announcement. \"We have already taken several steps to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, including limited public gatherings according to the public health department's guidance. ...\"\n\nThe Thursday declaration, as well as the new measures, intend to provide Palo Alto with \"flexibility in how we can respond to this changing crisis,\" Mayor Adrian Fine announced Thursday. The emergency declaration, he said, will help Emergency Services personnel \"secure vital supplies, funding and assistance.\" Emergency declarations allow local jurisdictions to activate their emergency plans and become eligible for reimbursements from federal and state governments.\n\nPalo Alto is one of many jurisdictions declaring a state of emergency, which comes the same day that Mountain View made a similar move and a day after the city of Santa Clara made its declaration. San Francisco and Santa Clara County previously declared a state of emergency in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nMore than 20 states, including New York, California and Washington, had also announced a state of emergency to combat coronavirus.\n\nShikada also announced on Thursday a series of service changes, most of which will take effect on March 16. Rinconada Pool was closed as of Thursday, the temporary Junior Museum and Zoo was set to close on March 13, and all Children's Theatre performances were postponed until June. Local libraries are disabling some computers to ensure \"social distancing\" between users and Development Center will only be accessible by appointment.\n\nThe City has discontinued police public tours and police and fire ride-a-longs and sit-a-longs. Patrol operations are also being modified for non-emergency police calls for service that can be completed via phone or video. Officers plan to limit face-to-face public contact and ensure social distancing of six feet when possible.\n\nOther services that are typically provided over the counter, including revenue collections, and Residential Parking Permit programs, will now be offered by appointment, as well as by phone, email and online. And residents looking to attend Monday's meeting of the City Council are encouraged to instead submit their comments via email (those should be sent to city.council@cityofpaloalto.org) and to watch the live broadcast of the meetings rather than appearing in-person.\n\nResidents who still want to attend are asked to sit at least six feet away from other people, to avoid shaking hands and to wait until the podium is clear to speak.\n\nFind comprehensive coverage on the Midpeninsula's response to the new coronavirus by Palo Alto Online, the Mountain View Voice and Almanac here.\n\n---\n\nFollow the Palo Alto Weekly\/Palo Alto Online on Twitter @PaloAltoWeekly and Facebook for breaking news, local events, photos, videos and more.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":751.0,"lat":37.9056,"lng":-122.5187}

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.\n\n\n\nRelated Coverage:\n\nCity News Service contributed to this post\n\n","category":"state_of_emergency","population":34484.0,"lat":34.0786,"lng":-118.4021}

The current projection for the next fiscal year\u2019s budget calls for 2.5 percent increase in revenues and staff will look at scenarios for a drop in revenue as much as 7.5 percent.\n\n\u2022 City staff who can work at home are now working at home and non-essential hourly workers have been suspended, but some may be reassigned to essential positions, said Nancy Paulson, city manager.\n\n\u2022 Staff is also going to look into conducting board meetings via teleconference or phone. A public room for the public to comment would still be set up as it is required by Nevada law.\n\n\u2022 Staff is also looking at ways to provide information for the public, both online at the city\u2019s web site and social media sites as well as possibly on message boards in public locations such as the library or outside City Hall.\n\nThe mayor thanked everyone for all the work they have put in and asked the community to stay in touch with neighbors and family.\n\n\u201cI think our community is well positioned,\u201d said Crowell. \u201cBut these are not easy times and it\u2019s not going to get any easier.\u201d","category":"state_of_emergency","population":92735.0,"lat":33.8374,"lng":-118.2559}

Declares Emergency","text":"Coronavirus Deaths In Washington State And California, Where Gov. Declares Emergency\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli\/AP Rich Pedroncelli\/AP\n\nUpdated at 8:45 p.m. ET\n\nThe U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 11 people, after officials reported fatalities in California and Washington state on Wednesday. The most recent death is connected to a cruise ship that traveled from the U.S. to Mexico.\n\nOfficials in Placer County, Calif., announced that an elderly resident has become the first person to die from the illness in California. The patient, who was not identified, had underlying health conditions, according to the county.\n\nThe patient tested positive for the coronavirus illness on Tuesday and \"was likely exposed during international travel from Feb. 11-21 on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico,\" according to a statement published on Placer County's website.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images\n\nRoughly a week passed from the end of the cruise to when the patient was hospitalized, officials say. An ambulance took the patient to a hospital on Feb. 27; in the interval, the person had \"minimal community exposure,\" the county says. The patient had been in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom extended his condolences to the patient's loved ones and said the state is working with federal agencies to trace people who might have had contact with the patient. Later Wednesday, Newsom declared a state of emergency over coronavirus in California, which has more than 50 confirmed cases, according to health officials.\n\nPlacer County spans a wide area, from the outskirts of Sacramento to Lake Tahoe.\n\nAmong California's cases are 24 people who arrived in the U.S. on repatriation flights from outbreak locations in Asia.\n\nThe other cases include seven people who were infected via person-to-person exposure and 12 travel-related cases.\n\n\"Approximately 515 persons have been tested to date,\" the California Department of Public Health says.\n\nTo prevent the virus from spreading, health experts recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer. Face masks should be worn only by people who are either sick or are caring for someone who is, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nWashington state\n\nWashington state raised its own death toll from COVID-19 to 10 people earlier Wednesday. The state now has 39 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease, with 31 of them in Seattle and King County. The other eight cases are in neighboring Snohomish County.\n\nMany of the cases are linked to Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., the long-term care facility northeast of Seattle that is at the center of the outbreak in King County.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, officials in Seattle and King County issued recommendations for vulnerable residents to try to contain the spread of coronavirus in the area.\n\n\"People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThat group includes people 60 and older; people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; those with weakened immune systems; and people who are pregnant.\n\nIn addition, officials said companies should take steps to allow employees to work from home, if possible, and recommended that people avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities and nursing homes.\n\nMore than 230 people in Washington state are under supervision out of concern that they may have been exposed to the pathogen, the Washington Department of Health says.\n\nLos Angeles declares emergency\n\nHours before Gov. Newsom declared an emergency for the entire state, the city of Los Angeles declared a health emergency over the coronavirus, citing the need to address the possibility of community transmission of the disease that has caused more than 3,200 deaths globally.\n\nThe move comes after Los Angeles County confirmed six new cases of the coronavirus and seven overall, according to Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\n\"I have signed a declaration of local emergency for the City of Los Angeles,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti announced via Facebook. \"While there are only a few known active COVID-19 cases in the region, the declaration helps us access state and federal funding to strengthen and support our efforts to prepare our region and keep our communities safe.\"\n\nLos Angeles County mirrored the city's move, in a step that the chair of the county's board of supervisors, Kathryn Barger, said was a planned reaction to the virus.\n\n\"This is not a response rooted in panic,\" Barger said, adding that the emergency declaration would help agencies coordinate their response and contain the virus in a county where more than 10 million people live.\n\nOne person has been hospitalized while five others are being monitored at home, Ferrer said. The county's first patient, a Chinese national who was diagnosed in January, has recovered from the virus, she said.\n\n\"Three of the new cases were travelers who were traveling together in northern Italy,\" Ferrer said at a news conference. Two others are relatives of a person who was infected with the coronavirus outside of the county, she said. The sixth case is a person who works in a field that exposes them to international travelers, Ferrer added.\n\nLater Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that a worker at the city's international airport who screened incoming flights from China and nearby countries had tested positive for the virus.\n\nCases rise in U.S.\n\nThere are at least 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19 that originated in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier Wednesday. That number doesn't include the 49 Americans diagnosed with COVID-19 who have been repatriated from outbreaks in Wuhan, China, and aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n\nAt least 13 states have reported coronavirus cases since late January.\n\nWhile international travel has been linked to 24 of the U.S. cases, the cause of transmission is still under investigation in 40 cases. Person-to-person spread in the U.S. has caused infection in 16 cases, according to the CDC .\n\nThe CDC data reflects numbers that were reported by 4 p.m. ET the previous day \u2014 meaning the actual number of cases in the U.S. might be higher than the most recent posting by the agency.\n\n\"States are now testing and publicly reporting their cases,\" the CDC says. \"In the event of a discrepancy, state case counts are the most up to date.\"\n\nIn addition to California and Washington, other states reporting coronavirus cases include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin.\n\nAlthough Texas previously had cases from people returning from China or who had been aboard the Diamond Princess, officials on Wednesday reported a newly detected infection in a person who had recently traveled aboard.\n\n\"Having a COVID-19 case in Texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn't change the fact that the immediate risk to most Texans is low,\" said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. \"This travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting limit the spread of COVID-19 and all respiratory illnesses.\"","category":"state_of_emergency","population":167836.0,"lat":33.862,"lng":-117.5641}

Officials have said that a state of emergency is meant to expedite the distribution of resources and should not be cause for panic.\n\nWhat do I need to know about the coronavirus?\n\nWhat do we know about the cruise ship?\n\nIt is believed that the deceased California man became infected aboard the Grand Princess, a cruise ship which made a round trip from San Francisco to Mexico last month.\n\nAfter the ship docked in San Francisco on 21 February, thousands more passengers boarded and thousands disembarked. The vessel then began a round-trip to Hawaii.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption The Grand Princess is one of the world's largest cruise ships (file photo)\n\nSome 62 passengers were on both the Mexico and the Hawaii trips. They have been restricted to their rooms for testing.\n\nThe Coast Guard will deliver sampling kits to the ship by helicopter on Thursday and a medical team on board will administer the tests. Fewer than 100 passengers and crew have been identified for testing, Princess Cruises said in a statement.\n\nMark Pace and his wife Beth are on the ship and told CNN they are among passengers allowed to roam around. They said they had noticed some changes on board. In order to get a plate for the buffet, they have to wash their hands and use hand gel. They are also not allowed to serve themselves.\n\n\"We are a little nervous about it. We knew it was a possibility. We came prepared with two weeks of extra medication and my laptop so that I could work if we were confined,\" Mr Pace said.\n\nThe ship is operated by Carnival, whose Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined last month after dozens of passengers tested positive for Covid-19 as it docked in Japan.\n\nWhat other action is the US taking?\n\nThe US government currently prohibits entry to foreign nationals who have visited China - the epicentre of the outbreak - during the past 14 days.\n\nUS Vice-President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that any American can be tested for the coronavirus if ordered by a doctor.\n\nMr Pence, who is leading the US outbreak response, also said that the White House will begin on-camera briefings on the virus.\n\nIn addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will lift existing restrictions on tests and provide new guidelines for speeding up exams for those who fear they are infected.\n\nBut some question how this promise will be kept, as public health laboratories insist their capacity for processing the tests is restricted.\n\nThere is also a question of cost, amid reports of uninsured Americans paying upwards of $1,000 (\u00a3780) for a test. The US House of Representatives approved $8.3bn in emergency aid on Wednesday to combat the coronavirus.\n\nSome health officials have accused the Trump administration of a slow-footed response to the outbreak, and concerns have been raised about a nationwide shortage of test kits.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption More coronavirus cases in the United States \"likely\"\n\nIn response, President Trump blamed the shortage on regulations adopted by his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama. The administration claims it has lifted these regulations by allowing local labs to create their own tests.\n\nOutside of government, United Airlines and Delta have announced cuts to their US flight schedules due to a drop in demand caused by worries over the virus.\n\nWhat are the latest developments elsewhere?\n\nThe worst-hit country outside China is South Korea, which on Wednesday reported 516 new confirmed infections, bringing the total to 5,766. The country's death toll stands at 35.\n\nIn an effort to curb the outbreak, South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun has announced a ban on face mask exports.\n\nAustralia has meanwhile banned entry for all foreign nationals from South Korea. Two people have died from coronavirus in Australia, and another 53 cases have been reported.\n\nMeanwhile, China has reported 139 new cases and 31 deaths, all in Hubei province.\n\nSchools have been closed for at least 10 days in Italy, which is grappling with the worst outbreak outside Asia.\n\nOn Thursday, the International Monetary Fund announced $50bn (\u00a339bn) of support for countries hit by the coronavirus. The organisation also warned that global economic growth was now expected to be below the 2.9% rate for 2019.\n\nHow have you been affected by the spread of Covid-19?

Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\u201cThis would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I\u2019d rather not do it, but we may need it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCuomo likened such a quarantine to a \u201cfederal declaration of war\u201d on the city and state. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. \u2026 I don\u2019t think it is plausible. I don\u2019t think it is legal,\u201d he said hours later on CNN.\n\nSuch an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.

In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.\n\nChildren have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19.

Many airports in Florida also are screening travellers from certain areas, requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\n\u201cI think whatever works is what we need to do,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe\u2019re either fighting the virus or we\u2019re not.

He says Wilson\u2019s Friday opinion is \u201cincorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis.\u201d\n\nItaly frees up $400 million euros for food coupons and food aid\n\nROME \u2014 Three weeks into national containment measures that have shut down most shops and non-essential industry, many Italians are hurting for food money during the lockdown amid the country\u2019s devastating COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nItalian Premier Giuseppe Conte told the nation he has signed a decree freeing up 400 million euros ($440 million) for food coupons and packages of food aid. Volunteers from Italy\u2019s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.\n\nConte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: \u201cPeople are suffering psychologically, they\u2019re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.\u201d\n\nConte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.\n\nGermany: 12 die in nursing home\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.\n\nAuthorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn\u2019t shown symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nLocal officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.\n\nAnother nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.\n\nGermany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.\n\nFirst coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.\n\nOne person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.\n\nThere are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nThe Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.\n\nSpain: Future of the EU is at stake\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc\u2019s southern flank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.\n\nSanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.\n\nHe calls for a \u201cnew Marshall Plan\u201d to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.\n\nItaly and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.\n\nSpain: Commuting ban starts Monday\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.\n\nSanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home \u201cas if it were a weekend\u201d to \u201cintensify\u201d efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nSpain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.\n\nSpain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.\n\nNew Orleans one of U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 hot spots\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.\n\nThe donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations.

The spread of COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving situation, and the City is dedicated to keeping the community safe and informed during this unprecedented time. Updated information will be provided on the City Website as it becomes available.\n\nThe State of California issued a Shelter in Place Order on March 19, 2020. In the strictest response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States so far, the Governor has ordered all California residents to shelter in place until further notice. This order is to ensure the maximum number of people self-isolate to the greatest extent possible, while allowing essential services to continue, in order to slow the spread of COVID-19. California residents may leave their homes to seek or provide essential services such as obtaining medical care or supplies, grocery shopping, refilling prescriptions and caring for an ill family member. Those who leave their homes are expected to maintain social distancing guidelines and keep a distance of 6 feet away from those not in their household.\n\nFor answers to frequently asked questions about essential services pertaining to this order, please click here. Click here to see the order in its entirety. Failure to comply with any provisions of this order constitutes an imminent threat to public health. The order carries the force of law and breaking it could result in a misdemeanor.\n\nHours before the State issued order, the Humboldt County Department of Public Health put an order in place that directs all individuals living in Humboldt County to shelter in place beginning midnight, Friday, March 20. Given that the San Francisco Bay Area is experiencing outbreaks of COVID-19 with extensive community spread, Humboldt County recognizes the imminent threat presented to the public\u2019s health. For more information from the Humboldt County Department of Health & Human Services, please click here. Updated information will be provided as it becomes available.\n\nAs of 2 PM today, the City Manager of the City of Fortuna will be declaring the existence of a local emergency. The purpose of declaring a local emergency is to allow the Emergency Services Director (the City Manager) to better control and direct efforts of the City to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak emergency and to be eligible for reimbursement for State and Federal disaster funding. The City Council will be required to ratify this declaration at its next regularly scheduled meeting on April 6 or it will expire.\n\nAdditional useful information can be found at the following locations: o California State Health & Emergency officials have issued new guidance to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in bars, restaurants, food trucks and farmers\u2019 markets. Please click here to read the updated guidelines. o There are no currently confirmed or reported cases of COVID-19 in Fortuna. The City of Fortuna is actively working with Humboldt County health agencies to protect our community, prepare for local cases and assist in maintaining the health and safety of our region. o The Humboldt County Joint Information Center will now provide daily updates about local\n\nCOVID-19 testing capabilities and results. The information will be updated Monday through Saturday and will be posted here. o St. Joseph Health has developed an online Coronavirus Assessment Tool that can help you evaluate\n\nrisk factors for contracting the illness. Click here to access the tool. o The overall risk of exposure to Humboldt County residents and visitors, including Fortuna, is\n\nexpected to rise as community spread of the virus has reached the State of California. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected. The City will continue to closely monitor the situation and is prepared to implement protocols as risk of COVID-19 exposure increases in Fortuna and greater Humboldt County.

And that\u2019s really just to protect yourself.\u201d\n\nBusinesses are required to exclude any employees who report symptoms of febrile respiratory illness from work for seven days from the day that they are identified as having symptoms.\n\nAnd businesses must direct employees who\u2019ve been excluded from work to isolate at home and to notify all close contacts to quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last known contact with the patient.\n\n\u201cWe know that this virus is contagious and it really benefits from crowds and crowded places and from people being close to one another,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cSo anything we can do to help spread ourselves out and to help minimize any inessential and unnecessary social interactions will actually minimize the chance that this virus spreads to our population.\u201d\n\nIn addition, health care providers will report on a daily basis to the public health branch of the Health and Human services agency all patients seen in their practice with a febrile respiratory illness.\n\nHealth care providers also will require patient information to include demographic information, including age, as well as residential address and clinical status, indicate whether rapid point of care testing was performed and their results, and indicate if COVID-19 testing was done.\n\nAnd patients, if no exclusionary diagnosis is found, will be directed to quarantine for seven days after onset of symptoms or three days after cessation of fever without the use of fever-reducing medication. They also must notify all close contacts to quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last known contact with the patent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to reiterate that same message that I\u2019ve shared before,\u201d Vohra said. \u201cBecause I really feel like it\u2019s our best shot and perhaps our only shot in beating this epidemic without having a lot of lives lost.

These numbers are going to go up, possibly dramatically.\u201d\n\nThe second person to test positive with coronavirus was a middle-aged man who traveled outside the country. He\u2019s recovering in isolation at home, Vohra said. Health officials are investigating the case trace the patient\u2019s contacts and contain any fallout, Vohra said. The patient was tested several days ago, and the county received the positive test results Saturday morning.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nVohra also provided an update on the county\u2019s first coronavirus patient: that person is recovering and none of their family members show signs of symptoms. While Vohra couldn\u2019t confirm the patient tested negatively, he could confirm the patient hasn\u2019t tested positive again.\n\nFewer than 60 Fresno County residents have submitted swabs for testing, and 50-75 people are being monitored after they returned from travel. While Fresno County doesn\u2019t have a lab that can test the swabs, the county has multiple labs available to send samples to, said David Pomaville, director of Fresno County Public Health Department.\n\nOne person with coronavirus on average could infect two or three others.\n\nDeclaring a state of emergency will give the county flexibility in managing its approximately 7,000 employees, many of whom have families affected by the school closures, Pomaville said. Later on, the declaration could also help the county apply for any funding relief. So far, costs incurred because of the coronavirus pandemic mostly amount to overtime pay, Pomaville said.\n\nVohra spent the weekend helping test people for COVID-19 out of an emergency clinic that was set up outside a medical facility. Test results for those patients will return in several cases.\n\n\u2018Social distancing\u2019\n\nWhile the risk of contracting the virus remains low for many Fresno County residents, health officials recommended people prepare for \u201csocial distancing.\u201d That means avoiding social gatherings of 250 people or more for people with low risk. More vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or those with compromised immune systems, it\u2019s best to avoid gatherings bigger than 10 people.\n\nIt\u2019s important to face the pandemic, and the public health department is ready to deal with and manage it, Vohra said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident we will rise to this occasion,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mayor Lee Brand attended the news conference where county officials gave updates, he did not make any announcements for the city of Fresno. Those will come Monday, he said.\n\nHealth officials also addressed the public anxiety and stress about the epidemic.\n\nDawan Utech, director of Fresno County Behavioral Health, said it\u2019s important to establish trusted resources, such as information from the county\u2019s health departments. It\u2019s important for everyone to do their part to prevent the spread by practicing social distancing, she said.\n\n\u201cWe know that keeping your mental health well is important in countering physical health issues, too,\u201d she said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":698021.0,"lat":36.7831,"lng":-119.7941}

Mike Garcia.\n\nIncreases noticed by landlords prior to the order, but that have not gone into effect, are prohibited from going forward, according to city spokeswoman Eliza Papazian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, the city halted evictions of residential and commercial tenants who can show they are unable to pay rent because of economic hardship related to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 during the emergency period. Tenants will still have to pay any rent they missed but will have a six-month period to do so.\n\nLos Angeles went further, temporarily stopping all no-fault evictions for residential and commercial tenants. This past Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom halted evictions of renters affected by the virus statewide.\n\nGlendale\u2019s emergency period was previously extended until March 31. That date was extended to the end of April on Tuesday during a council meeting, which was held as a teleconference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople are very scared, [council members] are at least aware of that.

County.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all impacted in some way by the virus, but we\u2019re not all impacted financially the same way,\u201d Sutton said.\n\nHe said the group supported renters providing proof of economic hardship, something the city requires for tenants to receive the emergency eviction protection. The rent increase moratorium applies to all residential units in the city, according to Papazian.\n\nCouncil members adopted the moratorium after a stream of residents called in asking city officials to consider rent forgiveness, or what many called a rent freeze, while residents grapple with new unemployment or increased medical bills in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome called for a freeze of mortgages and utility bills as well.\n\nGlendale has 29 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to county health officials. The virus has claimed one local resident\u2019s life. Countless others are dealing with jobs lost due to nonessential business closures mandated by the city and county last week.\n\nHaley Hopkins, a 23-year-old Glendale resident, told the council that she lost her job as a self-described blue-collar worker in the arts industry as a result of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to Hopkins, the renter protections offered by the city are not sufficient to meet the crisis at hand, echoing several others who called into the virtual meeting to advocate for rent forgiveness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly wondering how any one of you think I\u2019m supposed to pay my rent without being able to earn an income,\u201d Hopkins said during the public comment portion of the meeting.\n\nShe surmised that many residents will have trouble paying back missed rent and that landlords might be able to find loopholes in the rules.\n\nKwak is continuing to work from home as a freelance editor and proofreader but said she lost a part-time contract job with a law firm that was essential for making ends meet.\n\nWhile she has savings to last through April, she worries about what will happen in May if she can\u2019t find a way to supplement her income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExempting struggling residents from rent is not as simple as declaring it so, according to several Glendale officials.\n\nImplementing a rent freeze could violate state law and the Constitution, issues that would need to be addressed before a proposal could be considered, according to Garcia.\n\nIt might take federal action \u2014 such as a one-year mortgage forgiveness or stimulus funding \u2014 to make such a measure feasible, Mayor Ara Najarian said during the meeting.\n\nOn Wednesday, Newsom announced that several major banks and institutions had agreed to a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments.\n\nFamilies should not lose their homes because of COVID-19. Very pleased that Wells Fargo, Citi, JPMorgan, and US Bank have agreed to a 90 day grace period for mortgage payments for those impacted by #COVID19.\n\n\n\nA big sigh of relief for millions of CA families. \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) March 25, 2020\n\nCouncilwoman Paula Devine said she was worried about the domino effect that rent forgiveness could have, pointing out that landlords might consequently be unable to pay their mortgages, which could then have a negative impact on lenders.\n\n\u201cWe need to be fair to both the renters and the landlords,\u201d Devine said.\n\nSutton called the proposal \u201creckless and naive,\u201d adding that workers connected to the property business \u2014 like management companies, plumbers and gardeners \u2014 would suffer serious losses as well.\n\nGlendale Tenants Union members are aware that there\u2019s no simple solution to the problem but that tenants are feeling desperate, Kwak said.\n\nShe\u2019s heard \u201cbuzz\u201d about attempting a rent strike, something the tenant\u2019s union hasn\u2019t advocated.\n\n\u201cThis is the mood of a lot of tenants across the city,\u201d Kwak said.\n\nSupport our coverage by becoming a digital subscriber.","category":"None","population":203054.0,"lat":34.1818,"lng":-118.2468}

This declaration empowers the City to access state and federal resources, mutual aid, and other tools to help protect the community and City facilities from this virus outbreak, which the World Health Organization has declared a pandemic.\n\nHealdsburg City Manager David Mickaelian signed the declaration of Local Emergency today and the Healdsburg City Council will consider the declaration for ratification at its meeting on 6 p.m., Monday, March 16, at City Hall, 401 Grove Street.\n\n\"Declaring a local emergency means that we can more easily access state and federal funding and other resources to help fight this outbreak,\" said Mr. Mickaelian. \"It's a prudent and pro-active action to keep all of our community members healthy.\"\n\nHealdsburg's declaration of Local Emergency follows emergency declarations by the County of Sonoma, the cities of Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park, and Petaluma.

This includes gatherings at retirement facilities, assisted living facilities, developmental homes, and support groups for people with health conditions.\n\nA \"gathering\" is any event or convening that brings together people in a single room or single space at the same time, such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, cafeteria, or any other indoor or outdoor space.\n\nIn Healdsburg, the public events that will not be held include the March 17 St. Patrick's Day Parade and Celtic Concert and the April 18 Senior Center bus trip to see the play, \"Book of Mormon,\" in San Francisco.\n\nThe City continues to work with the Sonoma County Department of Emergency Management and Department of Health Services \u2013 which is working closely with the California Department of Public Health -- to monitor the coronavirus situation on an ongoing basis and may extend this event restriction as necessary.\n\n\"Our number-one goal is to keep the Healdsburg community safe and informed,\" said Healdsburg City Manager David Mickaelian. \"We are collaborating daily with the County's health department to see what actions we and the community need to take going forward.\"\n\nCleaning and disinfecting City facilities\n\nThe City is taking extra steps to clean and disinfect City facilities to help guard community members from contracting the virus.\n\nPublic bathrooms in City facilities now undergo a deeper cleaning and City staff are disinfecting frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and knobs, table tops and handrails with alcohol-based wipes more often.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.\n\n\n\nFor more information, visit the City of Hermosa Beach coronavirus webpage.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":19708.0,"lat":33.8654,"lng":-118.3966}

This declaration implements the emergency plan of the municipality and will help protect the health, safety, well-being and property of residents. This declaration of a State of Emergency is effective immediately and will remain in effect until further notice.\n\nThe declaration of an emergency under s 4 (1) of the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act provides the County of Lennox and Addington with all options available to protect the health and safety of individuals and families living in Lennox and Addington.\n\nWorking with the four lower-tier municipalities (Addington Highlands, Loyalist Township, Greater Napanee, Stone Mills) and community partners, the County of Lennox and Addington has been pragmatic in managing the COVID-19 situation. The County activated the joint Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) in conjunction with the lower-tier municipalities on Friday, March 13th. This team has met daily to ensure a coordinated approach in dealing with COVID-19.\n\nWith evidence of community spread of COVID-19 in the KFL&A region, it has been determined an emergency exists within the County that places residents at risk. \u201cWe must act now to address this serious public health threat.\u201d said Dr. Kieran Moore, Medical Officer of Health at KFL&A Public Health. \u201cThis situation clearly illustrates the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 and emphasizes the importance of practicing physical distancing and self-isolation in order to control the community spread of the virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring this difficult time, we are asking everyone in the community to take physical distancing seriously, especially around vulnerable populations\u201d stated Warden Isbester. \u201cAnd please, please stay at home to reduce the likelihood of further transmission.\u201d\n\nPrecautions to prevent transmission include self-isolation, maintaining at least 2 metre distance from others, avoiding all unnecessary travel, washing your hands often, and regularly disinfecting high touch zones in shared spaces in your home.\n\nThe County has been proactive in its response to COVID-19 and will continue to take action to help contain the spread of this virus. Although municipal offices are closed to the public, essential services will continue to be provided.

The disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.\n\nTo avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\nRead more about the coronavirus outbreak here on the CDC website.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":91030.0,"lat":37.6861,"lng":-121.7608}

Large gatherings like concerts and movies will be prohibited and most government work in executive department offices will be suspended in the metropolis. Suspensions of school classes at all levels were extended by a month.\n\nA copy of the guidelines said the movement of people in the metropolis \"shall be limited to accessing basic necessities and work.\"\n\n\"If you'll go to work, go. If you need to go out for medical treatment, go. If you'll buy food, go, but other than that, stay home,\" Interior Secretary Eduardo Ano told a news conference. \"We should practice social distancing.\"\n\nPhilippine health officials reported 34 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 98. Eight of the patients have died.\n\nWhile the virus can be deadly, particularly for the elderly and those with other health problems, for most people it causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. Some feel no symptoms at all and the vast majority of people recover.\n\nAno said the 8 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew, which was not among the restrictions announced by Duterte on Thursday, would apply to nonessential trips and leisure gatherings like parties, family reunions and concerts. Stressing the urgency of the move, he cited the case of Italy, where he said the numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths alarmingly spiked because effective containment steps were not put in place early.\n\nA police general, Guillermo Eleazar, said cities and towns would enforce the curfew once their separate councils have authorized it in the next few days.\n\nAno warned that infections may exponentially increase to several thousands in five months in the Philippines if effective containment actions are not set in place. He told The Associated Press that it's one of the worst-case scenarios drawn up by the government along with World Health Organization experts.\n\nA Manila official, Jojo Garcia, said shopping malls would also be asked to temporarily close, except for grocery stores and supermarkets. \"In this time, who will go shopping for a new pair of shoes?\" Garcia said.\n\nThe temporary restrictions will not amount to a lockdown of the capital because large numbers of workers, emergency personnel like medical staffs and residents on urgent errands could move within the metropolis or enter and leave the area after showing valid IDs, officials said.\n\nMovement of cargo and food shipments will continue unhampered, they said.\n\nMetropolitan Manila police chief Maj. Gen. Debold Sinas has threatened to arrest people who don't comply with the restrictions. Thousands of police will be deployed and checkpoints will be set up in entryways to metropolitan Manila, he said.\n\nBut a prominent human rights lawyer, Jose Manuel Diokno, said law enforcers could not arrest anyone for resisting emergency health restrictions.\n\nUnder Philippine law, police can arrest people without a warrant only if they have committed or are about to commit a crime, Diokno said.\n\nThe 74-year-old Duterte himself was tested for the virus on Thursday after he met Cabinet officials, who said they were exposed to people who tested positive for the coronavirus. Duterte tested negative, according to his spokesman.\n\n------\n\nThe Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Nearby Stanislaus County, however, has reported three infections.\n\nMerced County Office of Emergency Services and the Department of Public Health first declared a health emergency Friday.

For example, unofficial numbers from the Merced Union High School District show that excused absences Monday were up to four and half times higher than normal, according to Sam Yniguez, district spokesperson.\n\nYniguez said parents who choose to keep their children at home can do so without repercussions. But if it makes more sense for parents to send their child to school before Thursday, that\u2019s OK, too.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the reasons why we\u2019re not closing right away,\u201d Yniguez said. \u201cWe are giving parents and caregivers time to get their affairs in order before the upcoming school closure which starts Thursday.\u201d\n\nSome parents said the situation is causing added stress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a disruption to our schedules, so there is some stress too because we\u2019re not sure how long this will last,\u201d said Dalia Magana, 35, from Merced. The mother of three was picking up her 9-year-old child near Burbank Elementary in Merced on Monday.\n\nMagana said that she relies on child care, but she is able to work from home.\n\nShe said local education officials made the right decision in closing the schools.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s safety measures and I think that it\u2019s the right thing to do even though we\u2019ll all have to sacrifice. I think we all have to do our part and be OK with disruptions, be OK with stress because it\u2019s going to keep other people safe.\u201d\n\nDavid Smythe, a junior at Merced High, also said he understood the need for closures. \u201cBut I can see how it\u2019s kind of unfair to seniors, especially this is their last year at this school and it\u2019s kind of being compromised by them closing the school down,\u201d he said.\n\nNathan Quevedo, spokesperson for Merced County Office of Education, said MCOE received messages from parents about the school closures. Some parents had questions about childcare options and what the closure will mean for parents who work full time.\n\n\u201cWe really hope to have more information and more resources available for our communities in the next 24 to 48 hours. I can say that we\u2019re developing a webpage now, mcoe.org\/covid19, that will link directly to these resources,\u201d Quevedo said.\n\nQuevedo also said there are plans to have a map on the website with information about school meal preparations, which will most likely be a grab-and-go style, in order to try and limit the social interaction between nutrition services staff and the community.\n\n\u201cWe really have to think about there\u2019s still people that will provide vital services in our schools and make sure that they\u2019re safe and that we have the correct protective gear, that we\u2019re not putting them in a dangerous situation, we\u2019re being thoughtful about all of it,\u201d he said.\n\nQuevedo echoed Yniguez sentiments, saying for parents who don\u2019t feel safe sending their children to school, attendance is optional for most districts until Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf (children) are exhibiting flu-like symptoms or if they don\u2019t feel good, or if you as a parent just don\u2019t feel safe sending your child to school, we understand,\u201d he said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":144117.0,"lat":37.3057,"lng":-120.4779}

There have been 66 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County, according to public health officials.\n\nIn the proclamation, City Manager Kimbra McCarthy wrote that the spread of COVID-19 has imposed \"extraordinary\" requirements and expenses on the city, causing it to divert resources away from day-to-day operations. It also means the city may have to pursue \"potential isolation and quarantines of residents, employees, businesses and public safety workers\" affected or exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nThe emergency declaration is effective immediately, and will stay active for the next seven days. This gives time for the City Council to ratify the the city manager's proclamation and extend the state of emergency.\n\nPrecautionary measures include a blanket cancellation of all city events through the end of the month, including the cancellation and postponement of performances at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts. Hand sanitizer stations have been placed at city facilities throughout Mountain View, and city staff are recommending that all residents frequently wash their hands and commonly used surfaces.\n\n\"The city's foremost priority is to maintain the health and safety of the community and our employees,\" Mayor Margaret Abe-Koga said in a statement accompanying the declaration.\n\nOn Friday, city officials announced that several sports recreation facilities will be shut down starting this weekend. The Mountain View Sports Pavilion, Whisman Sports Center and the public pools at Eagle Park and Rengstorff Park will be closed from March 14 through April 5.\n\nWinter classes hosted by the city through the recreation department will be canceled from March 14 through the end of the winter session. A pro-rated refund will be given to customers with canceled class dates.\n\nPrior to the state of emergency, numerous city programs and services had already been canceled, scaled back or modified to safeguard against the spread of coronavirus. Library events through March 14 had already been canceled, and the Senior Nutrition Program -- run by the nonprofit Community Services Agency of Mountain View and Los Altos (CSA) out of the city's senior center -- had shifted its popular daily lunch program to take-out meals-only.\n\nAs of Friday, city officials say that the senior center will now only be open from 11:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. for the Senior Nutrition Program -- effectively closing it for all other services through April 5. All evening rentals at the senior center from Monday through Thursday will be moved or canceled, while Friday and weekend evening rentals will be honored.\n\nThe city has also sought to use video conferencing or outright cancellations of in-person meetings deemed non-essential, and has modified any trainings and gatherings hosted by the city to include \"social distancing\" -- often described as a 6-foot buffer between individuals.\n\nThe proclamation shows escalating concerns about coronavirus, starting with the first reported county case on Jan. 31 and the first COVID-19 death in the county on March 9. That same day, county health officials had announced a ban on all mass gatherings of 1,000 people or more in Santa Clara County.\n\nBut the trigger for the city's emergency declaration was a pronouncement by the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic -- the first such announcement since the swine flu in 2009.\n\nThe city has also announced the following events have been canceled as of Friday morning:\n\n\u25cf April 3 Concert on the Plaza\n\n\u25cf April 4 Volunteer Fair\n\n\u25cf April 17 Concert on the Plaza\n\n\u25cf April 18 Deer Hollow Farm Spring Tour\n\n\u25cf April 25 Spring Parade","category":"state_of_emergency","population":81438.0,"lat":37.4,"lng":-122.0796}

The city has already canceled most of its public meetings and planned ceremonies, consistent with Santa Clara County's recommendations to encourage \"social distancing.\"\n\nShikada also introduced numerous measures on Thursday aimed to limit face-to-face customer service interaction between the public and staff, including encouraging residents to call, email or make appointments with staff (the full list of changes is available here).\n\nShikada emphasized in a statement that the city \"will continue to provide essential services and community support through thoughtful planning for several impact scenarios during this time of heightened public health risk.\"\n\n\"This is a fast-changing situation, and service changes may continue to evolve,\" Shikada said in the announcement. \"We have already taken several steps to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, including limited public gatherings according to the public health department's guidance. ...\"\n\nThe Thursday declaration, as well as the new measures, intend to provide Palo Alto with \"flexibility in how we can respond to this changing crisis,\" Mayor Adrian Fine announced Thursday. The emergency declaration, he said, will help Emergency Services personnel \"secure vital supplies, funding and assistance.\" Emergency declarations allow local jurisdictions to activate their emergency plans and become eligible for reimbursements from federal and state governments.\n\nPalo Alto is one of many jurisdictions declaring a state of emergency, which comes the same day that Mountain View made a similar move and a day after the city of Santa Clara made its declaration. San Francisco and Santa Clara County previously declared a state of emergency in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nMore than 20 states, including New York, California and Washington, had also announced a state of emergency to combat coronavirus.\n\nShikada also announced on Thursday a series of service changes, most of which will take effect on March 16. Rinconada Pool was closed as of Thursday, the temporary Junior Museum and Zoo was set to close on March 13, and all Children's Theatre performances were postponed until June. Local libraries are disabling some computers to ensure \"social distancing\" between users and Development Center will only be accessible by appointment.\n\nThe City has discontinued police public tours and police and fire ride-a-longs and sit-a-longs. Patrol operations are also being modified for non-emergency police calls for service that can be completed via phone or video. Officers plan to limit face-to-face public contact and ensure social distancing of six feet when possible.\n\nOther services that are typically provided over the counter, including revenue collections, and Residential Parking Permit programs, will now be offered by appointment, as well as by phone, email and online.

McCaul, Peters, Engel, Guthrie, Eshoo, Hudson, Schrader, Bilirakis Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Prevent Critical Access Drug Shortages","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, Rep. Michael McCaul (TX-10), Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52), Rep. Eliot Engel (NY-16), Rep. Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18), Rep. Richard Hudson (NC-08), Rep. Kurt Schrader (OR-05), and Rep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-12) introduced the bipartisan Preventing Drug Shortages Act, which would help address the critical issue of drug shortages that affect the quality of care patients receive across the country. The introduction of the bill comes days after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first U.S. drug shortage related to factory shutdowns and shipping problems in China due to the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\nAccording to the FDA, in recent years drug shortages have steadily increased, and supply chains may become further stressed by the challenges associated with the new coronavirus outbreak. Most drug shortages stem from a supply chain interruption, often created by natural disasters, over-reliance on foreign pharmaceutical products, or manufacturing and distribution problems. These shortages threaten the adequate delivery of first-rate patient care, as deficiencies of drugs commonly used by hospitals to treat acute conditions, including bacterial infections and cancer treatment, can severely limit Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving medicines.\n\nThe Preventing Drug Shortages Act would help mitigate these shortage triggers by enhancing transparency throughout the drug supply chain process and strengthening FDA interagency efforts to fend off drug shortages. The bill would also empower the FDA to enforce greater reporting standards on drug and active pharmaceutical ingredient makers to identify and correct vulnerabilities in their supply chains.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s drug supply is heavily reliant on China, as we have seen in a recent drug shortage due to the Coronavirus outbreak. The Preventing Drug Shortages Act is a step in the right direction in addressing prevention, notification, and mitigation strategies not just in regards to China, but our entire drug supply chain,\u201d said Rep. McCaul. \u201cIf a manufacturer has a contingency plan in place, and gives the FDA enough notice, the better the FDA can find alternatives to keep supply consistent. A patient should not be at risk because there was a failure of the supply chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrug shortages under normal circumstances result in significant strain throughout our healthcare system\u2014from patients to hospitals and physicians,\u201d said Rep. Peters. \u201cUnfortunately, the health emergency presented by COVID-19 is exacerbating these problems and we are already beginning to experience its adverse reactions on global drug supply chains. While we may never be able to predict or fully prevent the challenges posed by situations like the coronavirus outbreak, Congress should take steps to fortify drug supply chains. By strengthening efforts across the board to prevent drug deficiencies, my bill would help ensure America\u2019s health centers have access to the proper resources they need so that patients can continue to receive reliable treatments.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the number of coronavirus cases grows in New York, it\u2019s critical that we take all proactive steps to ensure our health care providers have the medications to treat affected New Yorkers,\u201d said Rep. Engel. \u201cMany of our critical medications are sourced from China and India. The growing outbreaks in these countries and the first reported coronavirus-related drug shortage underscore the need to protect and secure our drug supply chain needs. I am pleased to help author this bipartisan legislation which will help mitigate these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it is an outbreak like the coronavirus, a natural disaster, or any number of possible interruptions to our drug supply chain, we need to ensure that Americans have access to lifesaving drugs at any time,\u201d said Rep. Guthrie. \u201cThe Preventing Drug Shortages Act will increase transparency in our drug supply chain so we can better identify where our system can be improved. I want to thank Reps. Peters, Engel, Hudson, Eshoo, McCaul, Schrader, and Bilirakis for joining with me in introducing this bipartisan, commonsense legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated how susceptible our nation\u2019s drug supply chain is to disruptions that could have devastating impacts on our public health because of our overreliance on China for generic drugs. The Coronavirus has already caused one shortage and it\u2019s unclear if there are more to come,\u201d Rep. Eshoo said. \u201cThis legislation takes some first steps to increase what information the federal government needs to receive from drug manufacturers about ongoing shortages and requires manufacturers to have risk management plans to mitigate the impact of drug shortages that affect the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo often I\u2019ve heard from constituents and providers that access to lifesaving drugs has been interrupted because of a drug shortage. We cannot let this continue to happen, especially as new threats like coronavirus emerge,\u201d said Rep. Hudson. \u201cThe Preventing Drug Shortages Act will bolster the data we have available to recognize these shortfalls earlier and eliminate potential shortages of lifesaving medications. I appreciate the partnership of Reps. Peters, Guthrie, Engel, Eshoo, Schrader, McCaul and Bilirakis in introducing this bipartisan legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drug supply chain is global and to ensure Americans have access to medicines, we must better understand where our drugs are coming from and how manufacturers will handle disruptions,\u201d said Rep. Schrader. \u201cThis bipartisan bill will help to prevent prescription drug shortages by mitigating interruptions in the drug supply chain like we are seeing with the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Commonsense legislation like this ensures that Americans can access the medications that they need for themselves and their families.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortifying our drug chain will help ensure critical access to necessary medications, especially during emergency situations when the current system has often experienced strain,\u201d said Rep. Bilirakis. \u201cThis common sense, necessary step is integral to protecting public safety and I urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort to expedite passage.\u201d\n\n###","category":"None","population":465.0,"lat":37.9763,"lng":-121.0439}

The new coronavirus, the seventh zoonotic pathogen from this family to spill over into humans, causes fever, coughing and shortness of breath.\n\nAs public health officials continue their work to contain the virus, a growing number of local residents are receiving notices that the agency has put people in their sphere into self-isolation. On Thursday, for instance, parents of children at Leonardo da Vinci K-8 School received an email from Sacramento City Unified School District telling them a family in the school was exposed to COVID-19 and has been asked to remain at home.\n\n\u201cAt this time, no one in the family has any symptoms,\u201d said Deon Davis, the school\u2019s principal. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, a dedicated team from the district facility department was assigned to deep clean the entire campus last night. Sacramento County Public Health has reassured us that all school activities should continue as normal.\u201d\n\nThese announcements came as the numbers of cases continue to rise across California. Four more cases were reported Thursday in Los Angeles County, which on Wednesday declared a local emergency. The four were part of a group of travelers announced by health officials Wednesday who were in northern Italy. The number of Los Angeles County cases is now 11.\n\nTwo coronavirus cases were also announced in San Francisco, where health officials say the two new cases were likely through community transmission of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe do not know at this time how they were exposed to the virus, which suggests it is spreading in the community,\u201d health director Dr. Grant Colfax said in a statement. \u201cWe expected that to happen and are further investigating the circumstances of these patients\u2019 exposure.\u201d\n\nThe patients are not related and have not traveled to locations with confirmed COVID-19 cases, health officials said as San Francisco Mayor London Breed urged calm. Breed, who last week declared a local health emergency, said her city has been \u201cincreasing resources and staffing to prepare for the community spread of this virus.\u201d\n\nThe patients are being treated in isolation at two different San Francisco hospitals, city officials said in a statement earlier Thursday. One of the patients, identified by San Francisco city officials as a man in his 90s, is in serious condition. The second patient, a woman in her 40s, is in fair condition. Both were tested Wednesday by a San Francisco Department of Public Health lab.\n\nSan Francisco is also where the Grand Princess, the cruise ship that carried the Placer County man who became the first to die of the virus at a Roseville hospital, is off shore and, for now, forbidden to dock.\n\nThe U.S. Centers and Disease Control and Prevention, state health and emergency services officials and the U.S. Coast Guard are checking if COVID-19 is present aboard the Grand Princess.\n\nThere is no cure or vaccine for COVID-19, but public health officials recommend practicing these habits to prevent it:\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nStay home if you are sick.\n\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue. Throw used tissues in the trash immediately.\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":1854698.0,"lat":38.5667,"lng":-121.4683}

It\u2019s a step beyond the local health emergency previously declared that will allow the county to provide additional support to Public Health Services and other agencies seeking assistance.\n\n\"It does potentially provide additional sources of funding for expenses that have been incurred,\" said Office of Emergency Services Director Marcia Cunningham, explaining that it puts the mechanism in place to account financially for the costs the agencies experience as a result of dealing with the virus.\n\nThat in turn will allow the county to seek reimbursements through state and federal channels.\n\nCunningham declared the local emergency at 9:41 a.m. Tuesday during a special meeting of the county Board of Supervisors. The board has seven days to ratify the declaration, which they are expected to do at their regularly scheduled meeting next week.\n\nCunningham told supervisors that five of the county\u2019s seven cities Lathrop, Lodi, Manteca, Stockton and Tracy had previously declared local emergencies in their jurisdictions.\n\nThe county has implemented the Multi Agency Coordination group, also known as MAC, to bring all the cities and the county together Wednesday \"to discuss a common approach\" to the current crisis.\n\nAbove all, Cunningham said, \"We all need to remain calm.\" She also emphasized the importance of each individual taking care of themselves, washing hands, keeping areas clean and avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s special meeting, the board conducted business with no members of the public in the audience. While they weren\u2019t banned from the chamber, the public was \"strongly encouraged\" to stay away and watch the meeting live online.\n\nAbout a dozen public comments came in by email during the meeting that were read aloud by the board clerk and responded to by supervisors and county officials.\n\nComplying with what is becoming the new normal, seating behind the dais was arranged to allow supervisors, the board clerk and the county administrator to sit 6 feet apart. County Counsel Mark Myles, who usually sits behind the dais, sat alone at the staff table in front of the supervisors.\n\nIn the single vote the board took on Tuesday, they unanimously ratified interim Health Officer Dr. Maggie Park\u2019s earlier declaration of a local health emergency throughout the county.\n\nPark told supervisors what is known about the 13 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county: there have been no deaths as a result of the virus; all the patients are adults (no children have tested positive); three are travel-related; two are from household contact, also referred to as person-to-person spread; and two are community spread. She did not know the source of the other six cases.\n\nCounty Public Health has moved from a containment strategy tracking all possible exposures to the virus and quarantining people to a mitigation strategy.\n\n\"Due to the increased volume of cases, and the fact that we now know we have community spread, we have moved into the mitigation phase which is basically telling people if you have flu-like symptoms to stay home and self-isolate,\" Park said.\n\n\"Once you have community transmission, we longer actually issue those quarantine orders because we have other work to do as far as continuing surveillance and messaging and providing guidance. So it is all self-monitoring at this point,\" she said.\n\nConcern about the county\u2019s inventory of critical supplies needed to deal with the virus was addressed by Emergency Medical Services Director Dan Burch, who said that a cache of personal protective equipment (protective gowns, face shields) and respirators have been dispersed to \"community partners\" including hospitals and pre-hospital agencies including fire departments and ambulance companies.\n\n\"We were able to immediately offer that assistance to those entities so they could ramp up their own supply chain issues. We are continuing to process those requests to assist but now we have to send those requests to the state and access the state cache,\" Burch said, noting it is a slower process.\n\nLarge health care providers such as Kaiser Permanente, Dignity Health (St. Joseph\u2019s Medical Center) and American Medical Response (AMR ambulance) have their own supply chains that are still working, according to Burch\n\nThe EMS agency has also planned for and stocked up on hospital beds that can be deployed to the county\u2019s seven acute-care hospitals based upon a study of available \"surge space\" at each hospital, such as conference rooms and hallways, should the need arise.\n\nSupervisors were also told that the Office of Emergency Services has activated its Joint Information Center, bringing together public information officers and representatives from 32 agencies countywide in order to provide consistent messaging to the public.\n\nThe primary sources of information recommended were two county websites: SJReady.org and SJCPHS.org. Information and assistance is also available by calling 2-1-1 or (209) 468-3411. Residents who believe they have symptoms of COVID-19 \u2014 fever, cough or difficulty breathing \u2014 should call their health care provider first.\n\nWith the new order issued by the county health officer restricting hospital visitation, supervisors called upon San Joaquin General Hospital CEO David Culberson to discuss activities at the county-run public hospital in French Camp.\n\nCulberson explained that more telemedicine consultations are being conducting each day in an effort to limit face-to-face contacts between providers and patients.\n\n\"We are substantially ramping back visits. It was up to half as many on Monday,\" he said.\n\nAnd while there have been some staff exposures to patients with the virus he did not say how many half tested negative and the other half are still pending test results.\n\nSince last week, Culberson has met every afternoon with the hospital\u2019s infection control practitioner, medical staff leadership, ancillary support and nursing teams to analyze current patients or those who have come through that have been tested or may need to be tested.\n\nTraining has been implemented as more is learned about the virus. Every morning, Culberson said, a current inventory of supplies such as face masks and gowns is conducted in light of some shortages over the past few weeks, but what has helped is that San Joaquin County is a Northern California distribution hub for many critical medical supplies.\n\nAnd while the hospital has upgraded its ventilators, required by patients with critical symptoms, it has retained its older ventilators that can be used as demand increases.\n\n\"On Monday, we established a drive-thru clinic. It is by appointment only. We have to have a virtual visit on a telephone first with a provider before we can make an appointment. We saw 25 patients (Monday) and I\u2019m told demand is pretty high today,\" Culberson said.\n\nHe made it clear that the hospital drive-thru clinic operating between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is not for asymptomatic patients. They first must consult with a doctor before being referred for testing.\n\nPark discussed the county\u2019s current testing capacity, noting the Public Health lab is only able to process 60 tests per day. That is changing however, as more private clinical laboratories are coming on line to process the tests for the coronavirus.\n\nContact reporter Joe Goldeen at (209) 546-8278 or jgoldeen@recordnet.com.

More than half of those cases involve people ages 20 to 49, but people who are 65 and older, or those who have underlying conditions, face the highest risks of serious illness or death.

Globally, the number of cases has surpassed 400,000, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nTo help reduce the spread of the global pandemic, state and local officials have closed or limited many businesses, including restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues.

This includes:\n\nAmid fears about a widening presence of novel coronavirus in Sonoma County, the Board of Supervisors finalized a local public health emergency Wednesday as health officials step up efforts to locate 78 local residents who may have been exposed to the disease during a San Francisco-based cruise to Mexico.\n\nThose Sonoma County residents were among 2,600 passengers on the Grand Princess ship that returned to San Francisco Feb. 21 after a 10-day cruise. Twenty-five shared a shuttle trip from San Francisco back to Sonoma County Airport.\n\nThe move comes as the county ratchets up emergency preparations to control the spread of a virus that still is not entirely understood.\n\nThe county currently has two confirmed cases of the virus, known as COVID-19. Both patients are hospitalized in isolation, though county officials have declined to say where.\n\nBut \u201cwe now believe that there a number of other people in our community that have been exposed, and so we\u2019re trying to identify who those folks are,\u201d Sonoma County Health Officer Celeste Philip told supervisors during an emergency meeting Wednesday.\n\nPartial activation of the county emergency operations center already has begun, and the county is establishing a 211 hotline intended to help residents find answers to pressing questions, Emergency Management Director Christopher Godley told supervisors.\n\nBut the county already is at a disadvantage in its efforts to gain control of the virus, in that it is still awaiting the delivery of test kits from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and so is limited in the capacity and speed with which it can attempt to detect the virus, Philip said.\n\nShe said she hoped the county receives some test kits later this week, which would reduce lag time between a patient\u2019s expression of symptoms and confirmation of the virus. But for the moment, specimens from patients showing signs of infection have to be sent to a state lab in Richmond or a CDC lab in Atlanta for testing, she said.\n\nThat makes it critical for residents to focus on practices \u201cthat we know prevent spread of disease,\u201d such as social distancing, hand washing and telecommuting, Philip said.\n\nShe and Godley said local medical and emergency officials had been monitoring the growth of coronavirus since long before the first cases began appearing in the United States, largely through the transfer of patients from a Diamond Princess cruise that had been quarantined in Japan until late February, when American passengers were returned to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County and Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.\n\nOne of the patients from Travis Air Force Base who tested positive for the virus but never developed symptoms was transferred Feb. 24 to a hospital in Sonoma County, where the person remains asymptomatic, according to Rohish Lal, public information analyst with the Sonoma County Department of Health Services.\n\nA second patient believed to have contracted the virus on a Grand Princess cruise ship voyage from San Francisco to Mexico Feb. 11-21 fell ill later and also is hospitalized in Sonoma County, health officials said. That person is in stable condition, Lal said Wednesday.\n\nThey are among at least 53 confirmed cases in California, where the first confirmed fatality included another Grand Princess passenger from Placer County, who died at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Roseville on Wednesday, officials said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":34089.0,"lat":38.2902,"lng":-122.4598}

Gavin Newsom\u2019s Executive Order, the local emergency proclamation also includes a moratorium on some residential evictions until the end of the local emergency or May 31, whichever is earlier.\n\nThere have been no reported cases of COVID-19 in El Dorado County as of Thursday about noon.\n\nSupport Local Journalism Donate\n\n\n\nThis moratorium is intended to help tenants who have lost income or incurred medical costs because of COVID-19 from being evicted if they are not able to pay rent during this local emergency, states the release.\n\n\u201cThis is a time for action to help our residents and ensure we can work closely with partners around the basin,\u201d said Mayor Jason Collin. \u201cThis emergency declaration is just one step.

Two more San Joaquin cases were announced Thursday afternoon.\n\nStockton will follow the recommended guidelines set forth by the governor and state public health officials regarding mass gatherings to help limit unknown exposure to the disease. Other organizations across the county have already announced this week they plan to cancel mass events, and area colleges have opted to move most of their classes to online.\n\n\u201cOur concern is for the health and safety of the community, our employees and their families,\u201d City Manager Harry Black said in the statement. \u201cLike many other cities and states, we want to make sure that we are doing everything that we can to limit the spread of coronavirus and keep people safe.\u201d\n\nGatherings with 250 people or more should be postponed or canceled, the city says. It also advises social distancing of 6 feet per person at smaller gatherings, and recommends that individuals who have a higher risk of severe illness from the coronavirus should limit attending gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\n\u201cI want to reassure our residents that we are closely monitoring developments around the coronavirus and we will continue to communicate with the public as updates become available,\u201d Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs said in a statement. \u201cIt is important that each of us continue to wash our hands, avoid touching your face and stay home if you are feeling sick.\u201d\n\nThe city will continue to evaluate how the public health emergency is impacting city-provided services and the community, as well as provide guidance to city departments, officials say. The proclamation and corresponding policies will be evaluated on a rolling 30-day basis.\n\nNon-essential city services, activities and events could be postponed, canceled, reduced in size, provided on a limited basis or changed to limit the number of people and reduce contact, city officials say. Any changes to delivery services or hours of operation will be posted on the city\u2019s website, as well as at physical city locations and offices.\n\nAll services deemed essential, such as fire, police and water, will continue to function at full capacity, Black said in the city\u2019s statement.\n\nBoth Stockton fire and police departments say members of their agencies receive training throughout their careers on how to utilize protective gear and protocols when dealing with calls involving communicable diseases. The departments will also provide regular updates and continual training as the threat of COVID-19 evolves.\n\nFirefighters always wear personal protective equipment on medical calls, such as latex gloves, said Stockton Fire Marshal Shannon Lewis. The Fire Department is currently conducting a six-hour training class related to San Joaquin County EMS Agency protocols, which will include guidance regarding COVID-19.\n\nIf any calls are suspected to involve cases of the novel coronavirus, firefighters will also wear gowns, eye protection and N95 masks, Lewis said. Fire Department personnel have also been asked to practice social distancing.\n\nIn San Jose, one firefighter has tested positive for COVID-19, prompting the testing of a second firefighter and the quarantining of 75 others, officials in that city said.\n\nOfficers will be equipped with extra masks and gloves in the event they have to deal with individuals who may have the disease, said Officer Joe Silva, a Stockton Police Department spokesman.\n\n\u201cAs it relates to responding to public health emergencies, officers are trained in understanding their role in the Incident Command System and working side by side with fire, public health and any other agency to address community safety concerns,\u201c Silva said.\n\nRisk of contact with a COVID-19 patient in San Joaquin County remains low, said Katherine Shafer, Emergency Medical Services Agency in a statement.\n\nHowever, because there has been documented community transmission of the new coronavirus in nearby counties and elsewhere in the continental U.S., Shafer has directed all emergency medical personnel to operate under the assumption that any patient with signs and symptoms of a respiratory illness potentially has a COVID-19 infection.\n\nNon-emergency city staff may also see some changes as to what they are able to do, such as eliminating face-to-face training or other non-essential events, said Connie Cochran, city spokeswoman. For example, events like Coffee with a Cop will be canceled.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to be doing things that bring people together,\u201d Cochran said, adding that the city\u2019s main concern is the elderly and populations with conditions that make them more susceptible to severe illness from the novel coronavirus. \u201cWe are really worried about people who are high-risk,\u201d she said.\n\nFor up-to-date local information regarding COVID-19, the novel coronavirus, go to www.stocktonca.gov\/updates.\n\nRecord reporter Joe Goldeen contributed to this report.\n\nContact reporter Cassie Dickman at (209) 546-8299 or cdickman@recordnet.com.

On March 4, California State Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in the State of California due to the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the State.

The Yuba County Board of Supervisors and Sutter County Board of Supervisors will consider her recommendation at their respective meetings on Tuesday, March 10, 2020.\n\nDr. Luu and staff from Yuba and Sutter counties believe this is the right time to make the declaration to ensure an appropriate, timely and organized response in the event COVID-19 cases are identified in the bi-county region. Dr. Luu believes it is simply a matter of time before someone in the region tests positive for the virus, so increasing monitoring and responsive capabilities now will further enable public health teams to prevent as much community transmission as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStaff from both Yuba and Sutter counties have been working closely together to monitor residents who believe they could have COVID-19, communicate plans with area hospitals and health clinics, ensure nurses and first responders have the tools necessary to keep themselves healthy and safe, and communicate important information to the public. A coronavirus preparedness group was established last month, and that group has been in communication with each facet of the community \u2013 like schools, hospitals, Beale Air Force Base, and public safety entities \u2013 to ensure the area as a whole is equipped with the best knowledge and tools to minimize the impact of COVID-19.\n\nOver the past several weeks of COVID-19 concerns, public health staff from both counties have been operating what is known as a Department Operations Center (DOC) at a low level. The DOC is now elevating to the next level and stepping up efforts to address the health threat. A bi-county Emergency Operations Center based in Yuba County has also opened. This means staff from both counties are working together around the clock to ensure that resources and staffing remain in healthy and reliable supply.\n\nA Bi-County Call Center has been established to respond to inquiries from area residents regarding the COVID-19 threat. The Call Center number is 749-7700, and will be open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The Call Center is intended to field general questions, not provide medical advice. Please call your primary care physician for medical advice.\n\nYuba and Sutter counties have been planning for this possibility and staff are properly prepared to handle the work to come. Since there are NO confirmed cases in either county, the approach may look different from Sacramento, Placer, and other counties, where community transmission has been confirmed. Nonetheless, increasing the level of public health response is necessary in focusing vital resources on preventing severe illnesses and deaths.\n\nWith no confirmed cases at this time, and per California Department of Public Health guidelines, en masse cancellation of schools is not recommended. Schools will continue with measures to prevent spread of COVID-19. The Counties continue to work closely with the Offices of Education in both counties and their respective school districts to plan and prepare our schools for COVID-19 (those CDPH guidelines can be read here).\n\nDr. Luu continues to recommend hand-washing and practicing good hygiene. Vulnerable populations \u2013 the elderly and those with chronic illnesses \u2013 are encouraged to stay home as much as possible and avoid large gatherings. Keeping yourself from getting sick in the first place remains key in this effort.\n\nIf you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as fever, chills, or cough and have recently traveled to a country with widespread community transmission (Iran, Italy, China, South Korea), or been in close contact with a patient who has had COVID-19, immediately contact your medical provider by phone \u2013 do not go into Urgent Care, the Emergency Room or the doctor\u2019s office. Instead, you should call your personal physician, who can assess whether your illness matches those of COVID-19 and if testing should be completed. If testing is indicated, the physician will then contact Dr. Luu, Bi-County Health Officer for consultation.\n\nFor more information and resources, check BePreparedYuba.org and BePreparedSutter.org.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":2948.0,"lat":39.1557,"lng":-121.7492}

This has prompted states of emergency to be declared at all levels of government, including from President Donald Trump, Gov. Gavin Newsom and in Solano County, where 13 cases have been reported by the Office of Emergency Services as of Saturday. The first reported case in the country of an individual contracting the virus without having traveled internationally or knowingly come into contact with someone with the virus was in Vacaville.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Solano County Public Health Department issued a shelter-at-home order, which was followed by Newsom declaring it at a much higher level Thursday.\n\nPer state law as well as the Vacaville Municipal Code, a local emergency proclamation must be ratified by the council to remain in effect, Craig wrote in a staff report. Once it is ratified, the council must review the need to continue the emergency proclamation at least every 60 days until it is terminated by the council.\n\nActing as the director of emergency services, Craig has also directed that City Hall be closed to the public \u2014 except by appointment \u2014 through April 7 unless extended further. Craig also recommends that staff telecommute to the fullest extent possible and those who do come to work at a city department stay at least six feet apart from one another unless it is impossible. Craig also suggests that staff be reassigned as necessary to ensure the government continues essential operations while the emergency is in place.\n\n\u201cAs one of many consequences of the recent County shelter at home order, the State stay home order, and the related efforts for certain employees to shelter at home, for employees to telecommute and for staff to be re-assigned to support continuing government operations, the City will be unable to promptly respond to requests for public records or meet other deadlines, including those under the Permit Streamlining Act and Federal regulations related to processing \u2018shot clocks\u2019 for telecommunications facilities and small wireless facilities,\u201d Craig wrote. \u201cTherefore the City seeks relief from these timelines by adding a further directive to the actions already taken by the Director.\u201d\n\nStaff recommends the council adopt the resolution ratifying the local emergency proclamation.\n\nThe council will meet at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the Council Chamber at City Hall, 650 Merchant St. While the public is not discouraged from attending the meeting, seating will be limited and those who do attend are advised to keep at least 6 feet away from others.\n\nResidents are encouraged to watch a live stream of the meeting on Channel 26, online at ci.vacaville.ca.us\/city-government\/agendas-and-minutes or on the city\u2019s YouTube page at Youtube.com\/user\/CityofVacaville.\n\nComments on agenda items can be emailed to the city clerk before and through the duration of the meeting by emailing cityclerk@cityofvacaville.com.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":100801.0,"lat":38.359,"lng":-121.968}

Declares Emergency\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli\/AP Rich Pedroncelli\/AP\n\nUpdated at 8:45 p.m. ET\n\nThe U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 11 people, after officials reported fatalities in California and Washington state on Wednesday. The most recent death is connected to a cruise ship that traveled from the U.S. to Mexico.\n\nOfficials in Placer County, Calif., announced that an elderly resident has become the first person to die from the illness in California. The patient, who was not identified, had underlying health conditions, according to the county.\n\nThe patient tested positive for the coronavirus illness on Tuesday and \"was likely exposed during international travel from Feb. 11-21 on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico,\" according to a statement published on Placer County's website.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images\n\nRoughly a week passed from the end of the cruise to when the patient was hospitalized, officials say. An ambulance took the patient to a hospital on Feb. 27; in the interval, the person had \"minimal community exposure,\" the county says. The patient had been in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom extended his condolences to the patient's loved ones and said the state is working with federal agencies to trace people who might have had contact with the patient. Later Wednesday, Newsom declared a state of emergency over coronavirus in California, which has more than 50 confirmed cases, according to health officials.\n\nPlacer County spans a wide area, from the outskirts of Sacramento to Lake Tahoe.\n\nAmong California's cases are 24 people who arrived in the U.S. on repatriation flights from outbreak locations in Asia.\n\nThe other cases include seven people who were infected via person-to-person exposure and 12 travel-related cases.\n\n\"Approximately 515 persons have been tested to date,\" the California Department of Public Health says.\n\nTo prevent the virus from spreading, health experts recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer. Face masks should be worn only by people who are either sick or are caring for someone who is, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nWashington state\n\nWashington state raised its own death toll from COVID-19 to 10 people earlier Wednesday. The state now has 39 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease, with 31 of them in Seattle and King County. The other eight cases are in neighboring Snohomish County.\n\nMany of the cases are linked to Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., the long-term care facility northeast of Seattle that is at the center of the outbreak in King County.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, officials in Seattle and King County issued recommendations for vulnerable residents to try to contain the spread of coronavirus in the area.\n\n\"People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others,\" they said in a statement.\n\nThat group includes people 60 and older; people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; those with weakened immune systems; and people who are pregnant.\n\nIn addition, officials said companies should take steps to allow employees to work from home, if possible, and recommended that people avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities and nursing homes.\n\nMore than 230 people in Washington state are under supervision out of concern that they may have been exposed to the pathogen, the Washington Department of Health says.\n\nLos Angeles declares emergency\n\nHours before Gov. Newsom declared an emergency for the entire state, the city of Los Angeles declared a health emergency over the coronavirus, citing the need to address the possibility of community transmission of the disease that has caused more than 3,200 deaths globally.\n\nThe move comes after Los Angeles County confirmed six new cases of the coronavirus and seven overall, according to Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\n\"I have signed a declaration of local emergency for the City of Los Angeles,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti announced via Facebook. \"While there are only a few known active COVID-19 cases in the region, the declaration helps us access state and federal funding to strengthen and support our efforts to prepare our region and keep our communities safe.\"\n\nLos Angeles County mirrored the city's move, in a step that the chair of the county's board of supervisors, Kathryn Barger, said was a planned reaction to the virus.\n\n\"This is not a response rooted in panic,\" Barger said, adding that the emergency declaration would help agencies coordinate their response and contain the virus in a county where more than 10 million people live.\n\nOne person has been hospitalized while five others are being monitored at home, Ferrer said. The county's first patient, a Chinese national who was diagnosed in January, has recovered from the virus, she said.\n\n\"Three of the new cases were travelers who were traveling together in northern Italy,\" Ferrer said at a news conference. Two others are relatives of a person who was infected with the coronavirus outside of the county, she said. The sixth case is a person who works in a field that exposes them to international travelers, Ferrer added.\n\nLater Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that a worker at the city's international airport who screened incoming flights from China and nearby countries had tested positive for the virus.\n\nCases rise in U.S.\n\nThere are at least 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19 that originated in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier Wednesday. That number doesn't include the 49 Americans diagnosed with COVID-19 who have been repatriated from outbreaks in Wuhan, China, and aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.\n\nAt least 13 states have reported coronavirus cases since late January.\n\nWhile international travel has been linked to 24 of the U.S. cases, the cause of transmission is still under investigation in 40 cases. Person-to-person spread in the U.S. has caused infection in 16 cases, according to the CDC .\n\nThe CDC data reflects numbers that were reported by 4 p.m. ET the previous day \u2014 meaning the actual number of cases in the U.S. might be higher than the most recent posting by the agency.\n\n\"States are now testing and publicly reporting their cases,\" the CDC says. \"In the event of a discrepancy, state case counts are the most up to date.\"\n\nIn addition to California and Washington, other states reporting coronavirus cases include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin.\n\nAlthough Texas previously had cases from people returning from China or who had been aboard the Diamond Princess, officials on Wednesday reported a newly detected infection in a person who had recently traveled aboard.\n\n\"Having a COVID-19 case in Texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn't change the fact that the immediate risk to most Texans is low,\" said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. \"This travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting limit the spread of COVID-19 and all respiratory illnesses.\"","category":"state_of_emergency","population":78.0,"lat":39.3591,"lng":-120.7906}

Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nTo prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve.

The strain that emerged in China in late 2019, now called COVID-19, is related to others that have caused serious outbreaks in recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).\n\nThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on Jan. 21. The disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.\n\nAccording to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.\n\nTo avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\nRead more about the coronavirus outbreak here on the CDC website.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":77700.0,"lat":36.9206,"lng":-121.7706}

From initial interviews, she acquired the disease through community transmission.\u201d\n\nYolo County Public Health Officer Ron Chapman spoke during an afternoon press conference in Woodland, emphasizing that due to privacy concerns information about the individual\u2019s city of residence, her age or the hospital where she is being treated would not be revealed.\n\nAlthough this is the first confirmed case, Yolo County has tested at least 10 other people for the virus, Chapman said.

We don\u2019t know enough yet about the fatality rate but the preliminary data does show it is much lower than SARS (9-to-10% from 2002 to 2003) and MERS (34% from 2012 to present) and maybe ultimately will be about the same as what we see with the flu.\n\n\u201cThis flu season, as a side note, has been particularly bad,\u201d Chapman continued. \u201cIn the United States, we\u2019ve already seen 15,000 people die from the flu. We\u2019ve actually had three people die in Yolo County from the flu.\u201d\n\nWorldwide, there are over 110,000 cases of COVID-19 with more than 3,000 deaths reported.\n\nIf exposed, it can take up to 14 days for an individual to show symptoms including having a cough, runny nose, shortness of breath and\/or a fever. Chapman reiterated that 80% of cases are mild and the best course of action is talking to a doctor and staying home.\n\n\u201cI know a lot of folks with mild illness are going to be interested and wanting to get tested but there\u2019s no vaccine or treatment for this,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nPeople age 65 and older are the most affected by COVID-19 as are those with underlying chronic health conditions. Yolo County\u2019s single case involves an elderly woman with underlying health conditions.\n\n\u201cChildren seem to be greatly spared according to data from China, Italy and South Korea and other countries,\u201d Chapman said.\n\nTest kits are being distributed to public health labs in each state as of a few days ago, he clarified. Though they are becoming more readily available, he said they should be saved for hospitalized patients, the elderly and people with chronic or underlying conditions and healthcare workers who may have been exposed.\n\nFlu season is known to end in April, but there is no telling when the spread of COVID-19 will slow down or cease. There is a vaccination in development but it will likely not be ready for up to a year.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of those unknowns that create fear,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cUp until the last week or two the number of cases in the United States hovered around 15. It\u2019s now over 500. They\u2019re looking at doubling the rate every two days from hereon \u2026 Where the peak is, nobody knows, but people will be keeping a very, very close eye on the data.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, personal prevention is key. Chapman offered tips like staying home if sick, washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds often, covering coughs, not touching your face, not smoking or vaping any products and getting the flu vaccination. Masks are not effective for the general public, he asserted.\n\nHe also suggests social distancing tactics like avoiding public events and large crowds.\n\n\u201cThe more social distancing and the sooner it happens the fewer cases and deaths we\u2019ll see \u2026 the more of those nonessential gatherings we can cancel and postpone at this point through the end of March the better. We will reevaluate after that.\u201d\n\nAs Chapman was talking with the board, answering questions about student safety and precautions related to protecting those in elder care facilities, Director of Yolo County Emergency Services Dana Carey had staff calling faith and community-based organizations, childcare facilities, schools and more locations to discuss best practice guidelines that will likely be released in the next 24 hours.\n\nFor the most up to date information on COVID-19, visit yolocounty.org\/coronavirus.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":402.0,"lat":38.7405,"lng":-121.8093}

It was to have been in effect until 11:59 p.m. April 17.\n\nHowever, Polis handed down his own statewide order later Wednesday, which became effective at 6 a.m. today, to expire April 11.\n\n\u201cAfter much discussion and consideration, our three local health departments have decided to rescind the local level Orders and formally adopt the state\u2019s Order. We believe this action will ensure Stay-At-Home requirements are consistent across the state, and hence will make it easier for our residents to follow,\u201d said a statement issued today by Boulder County Public Health.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Gov. Polis for taking this critical step to help slow the spread of COVID-19 in our state and ultimately, save lives.\u201d\n\nBoulder County rescinded its order as the number of those who have tested positive for COVID-19 reached 71 as or 4 p.m., up from 69 in the morning, and the county recorded its first death associated with the coronavirus, that of a Lafayette resident in their 60s.\n\nA release from Boulder County Public Health said the patient had underlying medical issues that were exacerbated by contracting COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to this family,\u201d Boulder County Public Health Director Jeff Zayach said in a statement. \u201cMy hope is that we all view this heartbreaking news as a solemn warning about the importance of heeding the Stay-at-Home Order and social distancing requirements in order to prevent more tragedies like this.\u201d\n\nOf those 71, five individuals are hospitalized, seven are under investigation, 26 residents are isolating at home and 28 residents have recovered.\n\nBut Boulder County\u2019s official numbers very likely do not fully reflect the actual number of people in the county who have the virus because there are numerous people who have the virus whose test results are not yet known or have not yet been tested because they don\u2019t currently meet the criteria for testing.\n\nThose testing positive for the disease range in age from the teens to the 80s, and the average age is 46 years, according to the release.\n\nStatewide there were 26 confirmed COVID-19 deaths as of 4 p.m. Thursday, with more than 1,400 positive cases.\n\nAlso, Thursday, Chana Goussetis, a spokesperson for Boulder County Public Health said the department is abandoning its practice of giving more than one update per day on statistics pertaining to the spread of COVID-19.\n\nGoussetis said that is being done to bring the county\u2019s practice into line with CDPHE, which has been releasing its updated numbers at about 4 p.m. each day.\n\nGoussetis also said it is believed that testing for COVID-19 should be expanding locally in coming days, but that \u201cLocally, we haven\u2019t been given any additional access to testing, so far.\u201d\n\nCurrently, she said, the recommended protocol from her department is \u201cIf people are feeling ill with flu- like symptoms, we recommend they isolate.\n\n\u201cIf they are needing medical help, then they should call their health care provider. They will do an assessment and decide whether they should be tested for COVID-19. And then, the health care provider refers them to where they can get tested.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 testing can be accomplished in Boulder County, she added, \u201cbut it is very limited because of the limit on supplies right now.\u201d\n\nSome county residents on Thursday expressed confusion as to whether simply going for a walk, a hike or a ride is still permitted. A \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d feature on Polis\u2019s website stated people are permitted \u201cto engage in outdoor activity, such as, walking, hiking, nordic skiing, snowshoeing, biking or running.\n\n\u201cFor purposes of outdoor activity, State parks will remain open to the public to engage in walking, hiking, biking, running, and similar outdoor activities but all playgrounds, picnic areas, other similar areas conducive to public gathering, and attended areas shall be closed.\u201d\n\nIt also states people must \u201ctake extreme steps to avoid contact with anybody outside their household and minimize contact in public places that could be contaminated with the COVID-19 virus.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf people are out and about, it is ideal if they stay close to their neighborhood, and they are not doing it with people they don\u2019t spend time with everyday, anyway,\u201d Goussetis said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that we don\u2019t want to see huge groups of people at trailheads anymore.\u201d\n\nOn a related note, Colorado Parks and Wildlife, to comply with Polis\u2019s order and to comply with directives from CDHE and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, today closed all playgrounds, campgrounds, camping and camping facilities, including yurts and cabins, at state wildlife areas effective immediately, until further notice.\n\nCPW planned to notify all campers currently at state sites to vacate immediately, and would be contacting reservation holders to provide a process for refunds to those affected campers.\n\nNon-campground outdoor areas of parks \u2014 including trails, boat ramps, marinas and shorelines were to remain open, although CPW managers may close some of those areas that do not provide for social distancing.\n\nSimilarly, the U.S. Forest Service announced today that the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests and Pawnee National Grassland would immediately begin the orderly closure of certain developed recreation sites and campgrounds, to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Closures will be in place through April 30, at which point they will be reevaluated.\n\nStaff writer Kelsey Hammon contributed to this report.\n\nLearn more\n\nFor general questions about COVID-19, community members can call CO-HELP at 303-389-1687 or 1-877-462-2911, or email COHELP@RMPDC.org for answers in English, Spanish, Mandarin and more.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":126054.0,"lat":40.0249,"lng":-105.2523}

COVID-19 news: Govts. declare states of emergency, Jefferson-Crook delay trials","text":"Deschutes County\n\nHealth officer: 'This disease is going to get worse before it gets better.'\n\n(Update: More from commissioners' meeting, county health director)\n\nBEND, Ore. (KTVZ) -- Deschutes County commissioners officially declared a state of emergency in the county at a special meeting Friday to discuss various aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nCommissioners said the emergency declaration is for 60 days, in an effort to provide emergency funds and policies that can better guide the public.\n\nThey said they want to make clear that this action is not at adding to any sense of panic, but will open the doors for more funds and support to get ahead of the virus, which has one presumptive case in the county at present.\n\nDr. George Conway, the county's health services director, recommended the declaration due to the need for supplies and in anticipation of more cases. He said the second, CDC confirmation for the county COVID-19 case should come back within a week and it will no longer be \"presumptive.\"\n\nConway also said the county is monitoring others now, but they are not \"cases,\" only \"persons under monitoring\" due to possible high-risk contact. He said they're not believed to have the virus.\n\nThe doctor said there's still no evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted in the air, only by droplets from cougs or sneezes, or someone who touches one on a surface.\n\n\"Any time there is a defnable pattern that could help the public, we will share that information,\" Conway told commissioners.\n\nHe said an infectious disease nurse has been working with seniors' long-term care facilities in the county since January, putting plans in place and doing proactive training to keep them safe.\n\nConway said that if the U.S. fails at taking these proactive measures, it will lead to much larger economic catastrophes. Everything people can do to delay the spread also reduces the chances of overwhelming the available resources.\n\nBut he also said: \"The disease is going to get worse before it gets better.\"\n\nHere's their news release:\n\nDeschutes County Commissioners issue emergency declaration\n\nThe Deschutes County Commissioners have issued an emergency declaration in response to COVID-19. The County joins two other Oregon counties that have issued similar declarations.\n\nThe emergency declaration authorizes the county to implement emergency actions, access more resources and take appropriate steps to recover some of the costs associated with the County\u2019s response to the disease.\n\n\u201cThis emergency declaration will help us to best serve our residents,\u201d said Deschutes County Commission Chair Patti Adair. \u201cWe want to be as prepared as possible to help keep our community safe.\u201d\n\nThe declaration of emergency comes two days after the Oregon Health Authority announced the first presumptive positive case in a Deschutes County resident.\n\nThe Commissioners met Friday to discuss ongoing and emerging COVID-19 related impacts.\n\nDuring the meeting, Deschutes County Sheriff's Office Emergency Manager Sgt. Nathan Garibay, Health Services Director Dr. George Conway and County legal counsel advised the commissioners that the emergency declaration will help county staff quickly respond and utilize all available resources to best protect the health of our community.\n\nLocal public health officials continue to urge residents to wash hands frequently, cover coughs or sneezes and stay home if you show signs of flu or a bad cold, including fever and cough.\n\nTo stay up to date on COVID-19, please visit www.deschutes.org\/covid-19\n\n--\n\nDECLARING A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE CITY OF BEND AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nBend City Manager Eric King has declared a local state of emergency as a result of the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has been confirmed in Deschutes County. Governor Kate Brown has declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Oregon.\n\nThe Bend City Council is scheduled to vote to ratify the declaration, which is in effect through at least April 15, at its meeting Wednesday.\n\nThe declaration allows more flexibility and authorization for the City Manager to take actions to help protect the health and safety of the community, through a number of means from limiting access to public places, to buying items or services related to health and safety without normal procurement procedures that can take additional time.\n\n\u201cWe need to move fast and be nimble in our responses right now, as this is a rapidly evolving situation,\u201d said Mayor Sally Russell. \u201cThis declaration should not inspire concern, but rather, should assure the public that the City is taking every precaution possible to prevent the spread of this virus in our community.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy primary focus is to restrict the spread of COVID-19 and to maintain the health of our workforce so employees can continue to provide crucial City services,\u201d said City Manager Eric King. \u201cI have and will continue to develop emergency policies regarding the use of sick leave, vacation leave, telecommuting, meeting protocols, and more, which will be in effect for the duration of the emergency.\u201d\n\nWhile this emergency is in place, the City will not send shut-off notices or shut off water for non-payment of unpaid water bills and will not allow any permitted special events of more than 250 people.\n\nTo eliminate exposure and spread of COVID-19, and in support of state and federal guidelines for social distancing, the City has cancelled all advisory committee meetings and public, project-specific outreach meetings or open houses. City employees are encouraged to telecommute and to conduct meetings through online conferencing tools when possible. Disinfecting and cleaning operations have increased significantly in City facilities.\n\nCurrently, scheduled City Council meetings are expected to continue, but with social distancing modifications including increased space between chairs. This results is a smaller capacity in Council Chambers. The City strongly encourages livestreaming the meeting from home through www.bendoregon.gov\/councilagenda.

Based on these recommendations we have evaluated and adjusted our services and response to calls for service. These decisions were made to follow social distancing guidelines.\n\nEffective immediately, the City of Bend Police Department will be evaluating calls for service to determine if they can be handled by phone, rather than in person. We also encourage the public to utilize our online reporting portal for appropriate non-emergency crimes. For general police questions we request the public consider calling into our office at (541)322-2960, rather than visiting our police department. The police department will be suspending public finger printing services until further notice.\n\nFuture adjustments may be necessary in order to maintain the staff necessary to serve the citizens of our City. Our officers will continue to respond to emergency calls 24 hours a day and 7 days per week.\n\nOnline reporting link:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.bendoregon.gov\/government\/departments\/police\/online-tools\/online-police-report\n\n--\n\nCity of Redmond Responds to COVID-19\n\nCouncil Considers State of Emergency Declaration\n\nREDMOND, OREGON \u2013 On Tuesday, March 17, Redmond City Council will consider a local state of emergency declaration which allows the City to efficiently respond to the evolving public service needs created by the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus).\n\nExamples include: The need to seek additional resources should an outbreak occur in the Police Department which effects staffing; or to seek reimbursement for costs associated with managing the organization; and other unforeseen time sensitive matters that may arise during a rapidly changing situation.\n\n\u201cThis authority gives us the ability to respond to unforeseen needs in a calm and thoughtful, yet timely manner,\u201d states Keith Witcosky, Redmond City Manager.\n\nBased on the state\u2019s guidance to reduce the spread of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, the City has cancelled all public meetings until April 13, 2020.

Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year. Crook County does not currently have any positive cases of COVID-19.\n\nCrook County Emergency Management, with the support of Crook County Court and the City of Prineville, today approved a County Emergency Health Declaration. The local Health Department supports this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the county response to this incident. This declaration will support the need for resources whether that is personnel or supplies. It is consistent with the State Health Emergency Declaration and the National Health Emergency the President announced earlier today.\n\nCrook County and the City of Prineville wants you to know that in partnership with our local and neighboring Health Departments, Law Enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network (COEIN), and medical community, which includes St. Charles Health System, the situation is being monitored very closely and following preparedness plans that are in place for any outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus not only in Oregon but statewide and globally is ongoing.\n\nCrook County Judge, Seth Crawford stated \u201cIt is our goal to continue our preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them\u201d.\n\nThe leadership of the county and city respect the privacy of the community members and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members. With that being said the safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available.\n\nThe joint city and county preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster.\n\nLocal Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza - The CDC is recommending non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:\n\nIf you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nClean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.\n\nTake care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.\n\nConsult CDC\u2019s travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.\n\nStay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.\n\nIt is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.\n\nThis week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people. The city and county strongly believe in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and needs to be followed.\n\nThere is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point. It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. The same precautions are suggested for any communicable disease.\n\nFor more information or general questions contact:\n\nCrook County Health Department\n\n375 NW Beaver Street, Suite 100\n\nPrineville, OR 97754\n\nOffice: 541-447-5165\n\nYou may also call 211 for general inquiries. The call center is set up to take your calls.\n\nMarch 13, 2020; 1:20 p.m.\n\n--\n\nCrook County Circuit Court & Jefferson County Circuit Court\n\nThe health and safety of all patrons and employees of the Crook & Jefferson County Circuit Courts are of utmost importance to the courts. We are maintaining regular communications with our state and local public health and emergency management professionals to monitor the developing situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19).

We don\u2019t have anything in place to meet the demand if this virus gets out of control.\u201d\n\nIn addition to giving a power point presentation prepared by Emergency Services Manager Kymmie Scott, Rehwaldt fielded questions from supervisors on a variety of topics. Those topics included the economy, the role local hotels and vacation rentals play in curtailing COVID-19\u2019s spread and the availability to test for the virus.\n\nRehwaldt also discussed herd immunity, the need to keep those who work to maintain food, fuel, energy, water, sewer and medical services healthy. Del Norte\u2019s Emergency Operations Center is currently at Level 2, he said, and is working on meeting the housing, feeding and medical needs of those who are most vulnerable.\n\nIn addition to calling for volunteers to build up a workforce to keep those services going, Rehwaldt said local emergency officials are preparing for a surge of possible COVID-19 cases and are trying to back up the medical system as much as they can.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not cut off from anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not like a tsunami event where we\u2019ll be on our own for weeks.\u201d\n\nDel Norte County has yet to see a positive COVID-19 case. As of 5:04 p.m. Tuesday, 37 tests have been administered to local individuals. The results for 31 have returned negative and six are still pending, according to the Public Health Branch.\n\nNoting that more than 300,000 people in 190 countries have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization, Rehwaldt said the situation is changing by the minute.\n\nSince Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order on Thursday, Rehwaldt said he and other emergency officials are trying to establish a community mitigation strategy. He referred to the essential businesses that continue to serve the public, including grocery stores, banks, laundromats, gas station and pharmacies.\n\nHotels are essential for many workers who travel while they\u2019re on a job, Rehwaldt said. However, he noted that it may be difficult to separate those who travel for work from those who are on vacation.\n\nVacation rentals are also questionable, Rehwaldt said in response to a question from District 2 Supervisor Lori Cowan.\n\nCowan said she has been fielding calls from constituents concerned about vacation rental bookings for spring break being cancelled due to the pandemic. But, she noted, many vacation rentals are used for traveling nurses.\n\nRehwaldt responded by saying there\u2019s not much guidance available from the state on how to deal with travelers coming into the community.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can deny travel outside of a general order from the governor to forbid travel,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve heard from other jurisdictions, enforcement of that is really tough. We\u2019re all waiting for better guidance.\u201d\n\nDistrict 1 Supervisor Roger Gitlin also brought up an economic concern.\n\n\u201cSome people believe the cure for this COVID-19 virus is actually worse than the actual virus itself,\u201d Gitlin said. \u201cBusinesses are shutting down, layoffs are ongoing, who\u2019s going to pay for that? People are suffering. How do you address the economic factor, if at all? Or are you going to take the position that you\u2019re going to do what\u2019s best as a medical official?\u201d\n\nCiting global reports, Rehwaldt said the virus has a death rate of 1 to 3 percent. In Italy the death rate grew to about 10 percent, he said.\n\nDel Norte County experiences about 270-300 deaths per year under normal circumstances, Rehwaldt said. The county could lose 10 times that as a result of the virus, he said, adding that the virus has forced his in-laws who are brewers and restaurant owners in Southern California from having to lay off their employees.\n\n\u201cAs a medical professional, in knowing what I know about this virus, I can\u2019t advise anybody not to follow the governor\u2019s directions at this time,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, health officials hope enough people will have been infected with the COVID-19 virus that communities will develop herd immunity, Rehwaldt said. But, he said, it could take an estimated 50 to 70 percent of the population to build up that immunity. If health professionals did nothing to try to slow the virus\u2019s spread, it could take eight to 12 weeks for it to replicate and jump into enough people to achieve herd immunity and many would die in the process.\n\nFollowing Rehwaldt\u2019s appearance before supervisors Tuesday, Scott told the Wild Rivers Outpost that her office and a plethora of volunteer teams were preparing for that potential surge in local COVID-19 cases. The Del Norte Office of Emergency Services is receiving shipments of personal protective equipment and other supplies from the state weekly. Volunteers make sure those supplies get to the local first responder agencies and healthcare facilities, Scott said.\n\nOES has also been working with the Disaster Animal Response Team and the Del Norte County Fairgrounds to make sure people\u2019s pets will be taken care of when the virus begins making its rounds in the community, Scott said.\n\nResidents can prepare for that eventuality by ensuring their animals are up to date on their vaccines, have tags if they require special medication and have enough extra food set aside, she said.\n\n\u201cIf they have to go for the hospital for awhile or even if they\u2019re ill at home and can\u2019t care for pets, we want to make sure people\u2019s pets are taken care of,\u201d Scott said.\n\nPeople should also ensure their personal lifelines are in place, making arrangements with friends, family or neighbors to ensure their loved ones are cared for if they get sick, Scott said.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s simply not an option, the county has structures in place for that anyways, but we don\u2019t want that system to be overwhelmed either,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to have needs and we\u2019re all going to have things to give and we all need to help each other out in the next few months.\u201d\n\nScott is also in the process of putting together a call bank of volunteers to help people get needed information. One idea, she said, was a phone-a-friend service to maintain a social connection for those who are weathering the pandemic on their own.\n\n\u201cEverybody can do that,\u201d she said, adding that KCRE and KPOD came up with the idea of a five-person challenge. \u201cI\u2019m just challenging everybody to call five people they wouldn\u2019t normally reach out to and say \u2018Hi.\u2019 I think that\u2019s awesome to get going as a regular part of this response effort.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the COVID-19 response in Del Norte County, visit the Prepare Del Norte website.

The number of people that authorities are saying constitutes too many has changed rapidly \u2014 an example of how quickly recommended responses to the virus have shifted.\n\n\"Something I\u2019ve told you is probably wrong by now because things are changing so quickly,\" Lord said toward the end of his presentation.\n\n\"This time last week, the guidance was mass gatherings of more than a 1,000 should not occur,\" Lord said. \"This weekend it became 250, as of the president on the news an hour ago, it is down to 10. ... He really wants people to stay home. He\u2019s saying avoid bars, food courts, restaurants.\"\n\nAnd that doesn't just go for people who feel sick: People can contract COVID-19 and remain asymptomatic \u2014 showing no symptoms \u2014 all the while passing the disease to others. So it helps slow the disease's transmission if even people who feel healthy avoid unnecessary gatherings.\n\nAlso over the weekend, Florida Department of Health-Flagler County Administrator Bob Snyder told the commission, the number of known cases in Florida jumped from 42 to 137; as of the evening of March 16, it was 142.\n\nBut, Snyder said, \"I feel like this weekend was pivotal,\" because in the county and local cities, he said, \"actions have been taken to cancel small or large gatherings.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s what mitigation is all about,\" Snyder said. \"If that continues, I think we have a high, high chance ... that we\u2019ll be successful in watching this virus die. ... We\u2019ve got to keep that up, and encourage that in addition to everyday good hygiene.\"\n\nStill, he said, \"At some point in time, we will have our first confirmed case of COVID-19. When? Don\u2019t know.\"\n\nBut the state will soon \u2014 likely by the end of the week \u2014 have the capacity to test as many as 625,000 people, he said, with assistance from LabCorps, Quest, various other private testing labs and AdventHealth's lab in Orlando.\n\n\"We know what to do. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we\u2019ll be on it.\" \u2014 BOB SNYDER, Florida Department of Health-Flagler administrator\n\nThat will likely mean an uptick in known positive cases.\n\nOnce there's a positive case in Flagler County, the health department will take the lead: Its nurses will interview the patient to determine who they've been in contact with over the 14-day period in which they may have contracted or been shedding the virus, and will then contact those people to see if they're sick and who they've been in contact with.\n\nThat process is called \"contact tracing,\" and the health department is accustomed to using it for other illnesses, such as HIV.\n\n\"I want our community to know, we know what to do,\" Snyder said. \"We are used to doing this. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we\u2019ll be on it.\"\n\nLord and Snyder have will also hold a phone meeting with assisted living facilities and nursing homes later this week, Lord said, as seniors are at heightened risk from the disease. The facilities have already started reducing visits, Snyder said.\n\nThe county is also shutting down nonessential services, such as the county library, while working to provide help to people who had relied on county services that are being reduced or shut down \u2014 for instance, the county's adult daycare program, or meals provided at the Wickline Center (which are now being delivered to individuals' homes). The virus could still be circulating as late as July or August, Lord said, citing the president's televised speech.\n\nAlthough residents should be prepared, Lord said, it's unhelpful to hoard supplies.\n\n\"People should be prepared and stocking up, but the whole hoarding three years' of toilet paper, whatever motivates people to do that, this is not the time to do that,\" he said.\n\nFor people who become sick with COVID-19 and have to self-isolate, Lord said, \"We can fill in that gap to get people toiletries and meals if they\u2019re locked in.\"","category":"state_of_emergency","population":549.0,"lat":39.2955,"lng":-103.0767}

Tenants will still have to pay any rent they missed but will have a six-month period to do so.\n\nLos Angeles went further, temporarily stopping all no-fault evictions for residential and commercial tenants. This past Friday, Gov. Gavin Newsom halted evictions of renters affected by the virus statewide.\n\nGlendale\u2019s emergency period was previously extended until March 31. That date was extended to the end of April on Tuesday during a council meeting, which was held as a teleconference.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPeople are very scared, [council members] are at least aware of that. That\u2019s a good first step,\u201d said Karen Kwak, a renter and member of the Glendale Tenants Union.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still not going to be enough, and I hope that they consider further action,\u201d Kwak said.\n\nKwak surmised that thousands of local residents might not be able to pay rent come April 1 or the following month, depending on how the crisis develops and individual circumstances.\n\nFor all those who missed out on this tweet, know your rights! Landlords in @MyGlendale may not evict tenants during this local emergency period. https:\/\/t.co\/2RbrRcpMl9 \u2014 GlendaleEconomicDev (@ChooseGlendale) March 25, 2020\n\nThere is understanding from the California Apartment Assn., a large trade group representing the rental housing industry, that there is a need for protections applied specifically to those who suffered economic setbacks related to the virus, according to Fred Sutton, who handles the group\u2019s public affairs for L.A. County.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all impacted in some way by the virus, but we\u2019re not all impacted financially the same way,\u201d Sutton said.\n\nHe said the group supported renters providing proof of economic hardship, something the city requires for tenants to receive the emergency eviction protection. The rent increase moratorium applies to all residential units in the city, according to Papazian.\n\nCouncil members adopted the moratorium after a stream of residents called in asking city officials to consider rent forgiveness, or what many called a rent freeze, while residents grapple with new unemployment or increased medical bills in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome called for a freeze of mortgages and utility bills as well.\n\nGlendale has 29 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to county health officials. The virus has claimed one local resident\u2019s life. Countless others are dealing with jobs lost due to nonessential business closures mandated by the city and county last week.\n\nHaley Hopkins, a 23-year-old Glendale resident, told the council that she lost her job as a self-described blue-collar worker in the arts industry as a result of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to Hopkins, the renter protections offered by the city are not sufficient to meet the crisis at hand, echoing several others who called into the virtual meeting to advocate for rent forgiveness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly wondering how any one of you think I\u2019m supposed to pay my rent without being able to earn an income,\u201d Hopkins said during the public comment portion of the meeting.\n\nShe surmised that many residents will have trouble paying back missed rent and that landlords might be able to find loopholes in the rules.\n\nKwak is continuing to work from home as a freelance editor and proofreader but said she lost a part-time contract job with a law firm that was essential for making ends meet.\n\nWhile she has savings to last through April, she worries about what will happen in May if she can\u2019t find a way to supplement her income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExempting struggling residents from rent is not as simple as declaring it so, according to several Glendale officials.\n\nImplementing a rent freeze could violate state law and the Constitution, issues that would need to be addressed before a proposal could be considered, according to Garcia.\n\nIt might take federal action \u2014 such as a one-year mortgage forgiveness or stimulus funding \u2014 to make such a measure feasible, Mayor Ara Najarian said during the meeting.\n\nOn Wednesday, Newsom announced that several major banks and institutions had agreed to a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments.\n\nFamilies should not lose their homes because of COVID-19. Very pleased that Wells Fargo, Citi, JPMorgan, and US Bank have agreed to a 90 day grace period for mortgage payments for those impacted by #COVID19.\n\n\n\nA big sigh of relief for millions of CA families. \u2014 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) March 25, 2020\n\nCouncilwoman Paula Devine said she was worried about the domino effect that rent forgiveness could have, pointing out that landlords might consequently be unable to pay their mortgages, which could then have a negative impact on lenders.\n\n\u201cWe need to be fair to both the renters and the landlords,\u201d Devine said.\n\nSutton called the proposal \u201creckless and naive,\u201d adding that workers connected to the property business \u2014 like management companies, plumbers and gardeners \u2014 would suffer serious losses as well.\n\nGlendale Tenants Union members are aware that there\u2019s no simple solution to the problem but that tenants are feeling desperate, Kwak said.\n\nShe\u2019s heard \u201cbuzz\u201d about attempting a rent strike, something the tenant\u2019s union hasn\u2019t advocated.\n\n\u201cThis is the mood of a lot of tenants across the city,\u201d Kwak said.\n\nSupport our coverage by becoming a digital subscriber.","category":"None","population":5158.0,"lat":39.7036,"lng":-104.9352}

See more coverage here. To support journalism like this, please consider donating or become a subscriber.\n\nShortly after Gov. Gary Herbert asked Utahns to immediately begin staying home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall issued a similar directive to residents in the capital city.\n\nWhile compliance with Herbert\u2019s sweeping guidance is voluntary for residents statewide, the emergency order Mendenhall signed Friday carries the same restrictions but makes compliance mandatory for city residents. And any violations are eligible for a charge of up to a class B misdemeanor.\n\n\u201cThis is about saving lives,\u201d she told The Salt Lake Tribune on Friday. \"It\u2019s about saving the lives of our neighbors and co-workers and family members. And this short-term pain will lead to a longer-term gain for us, and I think shorten the duration of the impact from a public health and economic perspective for the community and the state.\u201d\n\nAs part of the order, anyone currently living within the capital city must stay at home except for essential travel, starting at midnight on Friday.\n\nIn defining what the city considers essential, the order refers to the governor\u2019s request, which listed caring for family members, friends and pets; seeking emergency services; obtaining medications, medical services and food; and donating blood.\n\nMendenhall said in a news release that people who are already practicing appropriate precautions, including social distancing, will not experience a big impact to their day-to-day lives. People can still exercise, go to parks, hike on trails and go to grocery stores, she noted.\n\nAs for businesses, the mayor said she doesn\u2019t anticipate the order will force any more to close. \u201cBut I do hope that more businesses will operate only with essential personnel,\u201d she said.\n\nSalt Lake City\u2019s order incorporates all the directives in the governor\u2019s plan but adds a few city-specific items, including new measures at the Salt Lake City International Airport. Effective immediately, no one will be allowed inside the airport without an airline ticket or airport badge. All passenger drop-offs and pickups must be done curbside or in the parking garage, with all individuals other than travelers remaining in the vehicle.\n\nUnder city code, a violation of any emergency order carries a class B misdemeanor charge, meaning the standards are not stricter than they would be in a different situation, the mayor noted.\n\nIn a statement late Friday, Salt Lake City police said they won\u2019t arrest anyone for going to work on Monday and that they \u201cstrongly encourage voluntary compliance\u201d with the governor\u2019s guidelines.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\u201cWe are relying on businesses to take responsibility for their employees and the general public,\u201d the statement read. \u201cEvery effort should be made to telework.\"\n\nIf teleworking isn\u2019t possible, that person shouldn\u2019t be working \u2014 unless they are essential, according to the statement.\n\nThe city order is in place until April 11, at which point the City Council could extend it. Herbert\u2019s less-strict \u201cStay Safe, Stay Home\u201d directive will be in effect statewide until April 13. And he said it will work only if everyone shelters in place, adding that home is the safest place for everyone right now. The directive starts Monday for businesses.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an expectation that all of us will follow these directives, and we need to do that,\" he said. \u201c... All of us need to work together if we\u2019re going to get through and survive, and in fact, not only survive but then be able to thrive in a few weeks.\u201d\n\nMany of his specific requests already have been communicated by state leaders in previous weeks. But the governor said his intent Friday was to put forth a message \u201cof emphasis and reinforcement\u201d of those best practices at a time when Utah\u2019s total confirmed cases of COVID-19 have risen to 480 and a second Utahn has died of the virus. Those are the latest numbers released by the state Department of Health on Friday.\n\nAsked why he chose not to issue an order similar to those announced by 23 other states as of Friday afternoon \u2014 including Colorado, Idaho and California \u2014 Herbert said he thought this was \u201ca more positive route.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe think we have enough fear about this without adding to it,\u201d he said, arguing that a \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d order sounded like a World War II effort.\n\nHerbert emphasized that the state will continue to look at data about the spread of the virus and how various measures are affecting it. If those numbers look different in a week, he said, the state could consider stronger measures.\n\nAs part of his directive, Herbert is asking Utahns to not attend any gatherings with anyone outside their household. Children shouldn\u2019t be attending school and they shouldn\u2019t be having play dates or going to public playgrounds, he said.\n\nResidents should not dine out, except for getting takeout food or delivery, he said. He encouraged Utahns to help businesses by ordering meals up to three times a week or by buying gift cards. Leisure driving is OK, he said, but cautioned people to \u201cthink in terms of what can you do at home first.\u201d\n\nHerbert said Utahns can still hike, walk their dogs and jog \u2014 but asked residents to keep their distance from others. And public amusement parks, public swimming pools and gyms and fitness centers are off-limits, he said.\n\nWhile it\u2019s OK to visit a park, Herbert cautioned that people have a tendency even in open areas to congregate. And he asked Utahns to go to state parks only in the counties where they live. The national parks policy is still under review by \u201cthe folks in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Herbert said.\n\nOfficials will coordinate programs to help people experiencing homelessness find shelter and to limit their exposure to the virus, he said. His directive states that \u201cindividuals without a home may move between emergency shelters, drop-in centers and encampments\" and that law-abiding encampments of fewer than 10 people should not be disbanded by state or local government, and the city\u2019s order incorporates that exemption.\n\nHerbert stressed that Utah is \u201cnot closed for business.\u201d He said business is slower now and unemployment is up, but the state\u2019s Workforce Services will try to connect those who need employment with jobs.\n\nAnd state officials are working with lawmakers to find help for the business community, he said. At the same time, business owners and nonprofits need to do what they can to accommodate employees, he added.\n\n\u201cThey need to know they\u2019re coming to a safe environment,\" he said. \u201cIf they\u2019re sick, the presumption is that they\u2019re sick. This is not something they\u2019re faking.\u201d\n\nSalt Lake County Mayor Jenny Wilson said Friday that county leaders would likely issue their own guidance after stakeholders meet Saturday.\n\n\u201cI would expect when we finish tomorrow, we\u2019ll have a lot of overlap between the [governor\u2019s] suggested piece,\" she said, \u201cbut maybe take it a little bit further.\u201d\n\nOne difference could be adding an enforcement mechanism, like criminal penalties, for those who violate the order, Wilson said.\n\nShe mentioned \u201cegregious\u201d violations of the current public health recommendations, such as the large groups showing up at Salt Lake City International Airport to greet returning Latter-day Saint missionaries or hosting parties at parks. Wilson said, \u201cThat has to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the point,\" she added, \u201cthat we do need a heavier hand.\u201d\n\nHowever, Wilson said, putting into place a stay-at-home order for Salt Lake County residents wouldn\u2019t be easy since so many in the county work elsewhere, such as Davis County.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is, I think those arrangements can be made,\" Wilson said, \u201cbut time is of the essence, and this virus is not giving us a lot of time.\u201d\n\nShe said she hopes county leaders can come together to take an evidence-based and data-driven approach to the orders they hand down, so leaders are making decisions based on a common framework.\n\nBefore Friday, Summit County was the only one to issue a stay-at-home order in the state. The restrictions there \u2014 which, like Salt Lake City, limit nonessential travel and instruct residents not to leave their home except for necessities, such as food or doctor appointments \u2014 began Friday at midnight and will be in place until May 1 throughout the county.\n\nBefore issuing her emergency proclamation, Mendenhall said in a video Thursday that she was working with state and county leaders toward a statewide mandate but noted she was prepared to act alone and to \u201cact soon\u201d if that move didn\u2019t come.\n\n\u201cWe know that we\u2019re in a critical time,\" she said, \u201cand that the decisions we make to isolate ourselves as individuals and to make that as a directive as the public is absolutely going to set the trajectory for how long the economic impact lasts and how far and deep this virus comes in contact with our public.\u201d\n\nBoth Mendenhall and Wilson said Friday that they are supportive of the direction the governor has taken. Utah County officials also agreed with the governor, they said in a news release, and did not issue additional restrictions or add enforcement mechanisms.\n\nRep. Paul Ray, who sits on the state\u2019s coronavirus task force, reiterated in an interview with The Tribune on Friday that the governor\u2019s directive is not a mandate. The Clearfield Republican said he doesn\u2019t believe such orders are advisable.\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, we lose a lot of people to the flu,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess we\u2019ll see in the end.\u201d\n\nRay said he believes Mendenhall wanted the governor to make the politically fraught decision to issue a shelter-at-home order, but argues it\u2019s her decision to make.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier if you get him to make the call and you don\u2019t have to answer to the public,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we get elected to make the hard calls.\u201d","category":"shelter_in_place","population":379.0,"lat":38.0303,"lng":-107.3103}

We need your support to continue our important work. Please join your neighbors and become a subscribing member today\n\nThe city of Mountain View proclaimed a state of emergency Thursday afternoon in response to the new coronavirus, clearing the way for swift action against the spread of the virus and easier access to state and federal funds.\n\nThe announcement was quickly followed by closures of the Mountain View Senior Center and recreation facilities through April 5.\n\nMountain View joins numerous cities and counties in California to make the emergency declaration as the proliferation of the coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, has become a global pandemic. There have been 66 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara County, according to public health officials.\n\nIn the proclamation, City Manager Kimbra McCarthy wrote that the spread of COVID-19 has imposed \"extraordinary\" requirements and expenses on the city, causing it to divert resources away from day-to-day operations. It also means the city may have to pursue \"potential isolation and quarantines of residents, employees, businesses and public safety workers\" affected or exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nThe emergency declaration is effective immediately, and will stay active for the next seven days. This gives time for the City Council to ratify the the city manager's proclamation and extend the state of emergency.\n\nPrecautionary measures include a blanket cancellation of all city events through the end of the month, including the cancellation and postponement of performances at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts. Hand sanitizer stations have been placed at city facilities throughout Mountain View, and city staff are recommending that all residents frequently wash their hands and commonly used surfaces.\n\n\"The city's foremost priority is to maintain the health and safety of the community and our employees,\" Mayor Margaret Abe-Koga said in a statement accompanying the declaration.\n\nOn Friday, city officials announced that several sports recreation facilities will be shut down starting this weekend. The Mountain View Sports Pavilion, Whisman Sports Center and the public pools at Eagle Park and Rengstorff Park will be closed from March 14 through April 5.\n\nWinter classes hosted by the city through the recreation department will be canceled from March 14 through the end of the winter session. A pro-rated refund will be given to customers with canceled class dates.\n\nPrior to the state of emergency, numerous city programs and services had already been canceled, scaled back or modified to safeguard against the spread of coronavirus. Library events through March 14 had already been canceled, and the Senior Nutrition Program -- run by the nonprofit Community Services Agency of Mountain View and Los Altos (CSA) out of the city's senior center -- had shifted its popular daily lunch program to take-out meals-only.\n\nAs of Friday, city officials say that the senior center will now only be open from 11:15 a.m. to 12:15 p.m. for the Senior Nutrition Program -- effectively closing it for all other services through April 5. All evening rentals at the senior center from Monday through Thursday will be moved or canceled, while Friday and weekend evening rentals will be honored.\n\nThe city has also sought to use video conferencing or outright cancellations of in-person meetings deemed non-essential, and has modified any trainings and gatherings hosted by the city to include \"social distancing\" -- often described as a 6-foot buffer between individuals.\n\nThe proclamation shows escalating concerns about coronavirus, starting with the first reported county case on Jan. 31 and the first COVID-19 death in the county on March 9. That same day, county health officials had announced a ban on all mass gatherings of 1,000 people or more in Santa Clara County.\n\nBut the trigger for the city's emergency declaration was a pronouncement by the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring that COVID-19 had become a global pandemic -- the first such announcement since the swine flu in 2009.\n\nThe city has also announced the following events have been canceled as of Friday morning:\n\n\u25cf April 3 Concert on the Plaza\n\n\u25cf April 4 Volunteer Fair\n\n\u25cf April 17 Concert on the Plaza\n\n\u25cf April 18 Deer Hollow Farm Spring Tour\n\n\u25cf April 25 Spring Parade","category":"state_of_emergency","population":537.0,"lat":39.7748,"lng":-105.0567}

The move is to comply with health authorities\u2019 recommendations to limit gatherings to fewer than ten people at a time, and also to provide space between members of the public to avoid contagion.\n\nThe town is also delivering a formal response plan to staff, to guide the town\u2019s response to different stages of the pandemic. The city of Ouray and the county have already decided to close their offices to the public.\n\nStory updated 5:05 p.m. Monday\n\nGov. Jared Polis this afternoon ordered the closure of all Colorado restaurants and bars to in-person dining in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nPolis also ordered the closure of theaters, casinos and gyms.\n\nMeanwhile, state health officials announced that the state\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus cases has jumped to 160. Colorado has completed test results on 1,200 people since Feb. 28, but there are many still pending. Officials have not yet offered a demographic breakdown of the new cases due to the high volume of testing being processed by the state lab. As of this morning, Ouray County did not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\nHere in Ouray County, both the Ouray City Council and the Ouray County Board of County Commissioners unanimously declared disaster emergencies this afternoon in moves that grant them broad power. City Administrator Justin Perry ordered the indefinite closure of the Ouray Hot Springs Pool and Fitness Center this morning, as well as the closure of City Hall to the public through at least April 3.\n\nIn addition, all county buildings will be closed to the public as well, effective 8 a.m. Wednesday.

These mountain counties have the highest number of positive coronavirus tests in the state, outside the Denver metro area.\n\nSan Miguel County Public Health Director Grace Franklin cited the similar characteristics of San Miguel County to these other communities, attracting lots of international ski tourism, which have experienced a \"disproportionate spike\" in cases compared to other areas of the state.\n\nThese recommendations include avoiding public spaces, not shaking hands avoiding mass gatherings or gathering in group settings, and practicing social distancing of at least six feet in between people. They also advise staying home if you feel sick and cleaning and disinfecting surfaces frequently, including cell phones, as well as washing hands thoroughly with soap and water.\n\nOuray County commissioners and City of Ouray officials are also scheduled to meet with Ouray County Public Health Director Tanner Kingery on Monday for a briefing on coronavirus here in Ouray County and to discuss next steps. The City Council's meeting is at 1 p.m. at the Massard Room at City Hall and the emergency meeting with the commissioners is scheduled for 4 p.m. at the 4-H Event Center in Ridgway.\n\nStory updated at 3:15 p.m. Sunday\n\nRidgway and Ouray school districts will close for two weeks in an effort to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nIn an email sent to the school community just after 3 p.m. today, Ridgway Superintendent Susan Lacy said both districts were closing with the support of Ouray County Public Health. The districts had originally planned to close on Monday and take the day to evaluate future steps. Lacy, though, said she had a telephone conference with Ouray County Public Health Director Tanner Kingery, Ouray School District Lead Supervisor Kenneth Nelson, County Emergency Manager Glenn Boyd and County Commissioner Ben Tisdel.\n\n\"County officials confirmed that the response to the virus necessitates a shift from a reactive to a proactive model. Things are moving quickly and it is important to reevaluate on a continual basis,\" Lacy wrote in the email.\n\nThat means both districts will be closed through March 27, followed by spring break, which runs from March 28 to April 6. Lacy said officials will re-evaluate the situation during spring break and determine if classes will resume on April 7.\n\nLacy said the Ridgway School District will create eight days worth of daily learning plans for each week \u2014 Tuesday-Friday of this week and Monday-Thursday of the week of March 23 to \"provide as much support and a sense of normalcy for our students as possible, during what I know is a difficult moment for all of our families.\"\n\nLacy said teachers will roll out class-specific activities that can be done at home to support continued learning and stability for students.\n\nOuray County commissioners, meanwhile, have called a special meeting at 4 p.m. Monday to receive updates on the coronavirus, discuss next steps and policies and provide direction to staff.\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, there were a total of 131 positive cases of COVID-19 in Colorado but no confirmed cases in Ouray County.\n\n----------------\n\nOuray County does not have any cases of coronavirus at this time, according to information updated Sunday by the state health department.\n\nThe total number of confirmed cases in Colorado at this time is 101. Gunnison County announced its first case last week, and Mesa County announced its first case on Saturday.\n\nAnyone with questions about testing is asked to call their primary care doctor at this time. There is also a statewide call line established for questions about COVID-19, 1-877-462-2911, and an email address, cohelp@rmpdc.org.\n\nOver the past week, Gov. Jared Polis encouraged communities to limit opportunities for germs to spread and slow contraction of the illness. Local events, including concerts and gatherings, have largely been canceled or postponed in response to a request from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment requesting all community events with 250 or more people be canceled or postponed.\n\nPolis also warned older people not to travel to Colorado\u2019s mountain communities, citing concerns about cases identified in Pitkin and Eagle counties with community spread of the illness and the lack of resources to respond to the sickness in more rural areas. The first death attributed to COVID-19 was announced Friday - a woman in her 80s in El Paso County.\n\nAfter other ski resorts across the state announced they would close due to coronavirus concerns, Telluride Ski Resort announced it would close \"effective immediately\" for the season. The announcement came Saturday night after Gov. Polis told Colorado Ski Country USA late Saturday afternoon he would be issuing an executive order requiring the state's ski resorts to close for a period of time, according to Telluride Ski Resort's statement. The gondola will continue running to Mountain Village for pedestrian traffic for the time being.\n\nSmaller events here in Ouray County were postponed or canceled in an abundance of caution - including everything from the Ouray Elks Lodge St. Patrick\u2019s Day Dinner and bingo to a Ridgway Town Council candidate forum. Some local churches, including St. John\u2019s Episcopal Church in Ouray, have responded to requests from church leaders to cease in-person services for the time being to limit possible exposure. Local banks announced ramped-up cleaning efforts and encouraged customers to use online banking resources.\n\nOuray Hot Springs Pool Manager Kentee Pasek said employees are taking extra care to wipe down handrails, door knobs and other high-touch surfaces.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything within our capability of being able to be as safe and clean a facility as possible, but that\u2019s something we\u2019re doing anyway,\u201d she said.\n\nShe reminded patrons that the pool adds chlorine to the mineral water at levels recommended by state health officials to keep the water safe.\n\nPasek said the decision if and when to close the pool would be made by Ouray County Public Health Director Tanner Kingery. \"That is not something I would do, it is something that Tanner would do and make that call.\"\n\nHowever, Kingery said he provides guidance and he's using the same set of public health recommendations from the state for the pool as he's using for similar facilities like schools and childcare centers. It's up to the pool management to make that decision and that they are free to take preemptive measures.\n\nNeighboring school districts have announced extended spring breaks or closures for weeks. On Friday, Ridgway Superintendent Susan Lacy announced the district would be closing on Monday to students for cleaning, and indicated the closure might be longer and is under consideration. Ouray School District issued the same decision on Saturday morning, with Lead Administrator Kenneth Nelson indicating the school is keeping an eye on the situation and will make announcements of longer closures by Monday evening if they are warranted.\n\nBoth school districts have canceled their spring sports and practices until at least early April, in response to a decision made by the Colorado High School Activities Association. CHSAA limited attendance at the state basketball playoffs, in which the Ouray boys\u2019 team participated, citing concerns that a safe distance between attendees (six to eight feet recommended distance) couldn\u2019t be accommodated.\n\nThe tournament was canceled after the state announced gatherings of 250 or more people should end and the venue hosting the tournament, the University of Denver, said it could no longer host the games.\n\nSome local businesses have responded to community members who have decided to keep their social distance by advertising delivery or take-out meals. Others in the community have offered to shop for older residents or those with health concerns who don\u2019t want to risk exposure.\n\nAt least one Ouray County nonprofit organization has also offered to assist those who need help with supplies - the Ouray County Woman\u2019s Club.\n\nMembers of the Woman\u2019s Club who have a medical reason for isolating themselves during this time (or have symptoms of illness) can e-mail womansclubouray@gmail.com for help with errands, groceries, mail, medications and other assistance.\n\nAnyone who is willing to help members with these needs can also email the same address and offer assistance to others in the community.\n\nAt least one business in Ouray County has chosen to close entirely. The Wiesbaden Hot Springs Spa & Lodgings announced on its website this afternoon it will close through May 1, saying it is \"taking the current health threat of the Covid 19 Virus very seriously.\" Officials there said they will perform previously planned improvements in exterior rooms and spa areas during the closure.\n\n\"We apologize for any inconvenience related to this decision, but are confident in your understanding,\" a message posted on the Wiesbaden's website read.\n\nThe Ouray Public Library announced it will waive fines, or deliver books within the city limits for the rest of the month or help patrons with online resources. Anyone can email the library at ouraypl@gmail.com or use the online catalog to look up resources, as well as call the library at 325-4616.\n\nAccording to state public health officials, 813 people have been tested for the illness in Colorado as of noon on Saturday. Of those 813, 101 tested positive and 712 tested negative.\n\nAnyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 or meets the specific criteria for testing is encouraged to contact their primary care provider for next steps. According to information from Kingery last week, tests are transported to the state lab in Denver via courier. State public health officials have said their current turnaround time for those tests is less than 72 hours. If a test is presumptive positive at that time, it is reported by the state health department. Those positive samples are then sent on to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta for verification. Negative test samples are returned to providers who authorized the tests, so they may take longer to communicate results to patients.\n\nThe CDC has issued several advisories about the illness, including one titled, \"Get your household ready for Coronavirus,\" available here.\n\nPlease note the Plaindealer is attempting to keep an updated list of closures, postponements and cancellations.

If there is an order from the governor that says no gathering in public places for the next 24 hours, for example, council could be in violation of the open meetings act if there was not a mechanism in place for council to meet remotely, he said.\n\nThe resolution acknowledges potential problems with video conferencing council meetings \u2014 including issues with presentations, the inability for council to read nonverbal language and general inefficiencies \u2014 and says the policy can be used only if Town Council adopts a resolution declaring a local disaster emergency or the town manager declares such an emergency.\n\nSupport Local Journalism Donate\n\n\n\nThe second resolution allows the town manager to use up to $100,000 of town funding in response to an emergency. The resolution details that if the governor declares a statewide emergency related to the coronavirus and the town needs to expend resources not previously budgeted, the town or the town manager would be authorized to use town funds for the interest of public health and safety for the town, the state and the county.\n\nMore on COVID-19 The latest Summit County news, how to protect yourself and local resources.\n\nBreckenridge Town Council discussed similar actions Tuesday regarding remote video conferencing. Town Manager Rick Holman said this would be brought back to council at the next work session March 24. On Thursday, the Town Council called a special meeting to discuss COVID-19 as it pertains to events and determined it would be in the town\u2019s best interest to limit gatherings that occur on town property \u2014 or are run by the town \u2014 to 50 people, and to recommend that town businesses follow suit.\n\nTown attorney Tim Berry presented an emergency ordinance at the special meeting that gives Holman broad powers to do what he thinks is necessary to address public health concerns, including the authority to close any town-owned facility and to use town funds as necessary. The ordinance was passed by council unanimously. As an emergency ordinance, there will be no second reading.","category":"None","population":18396.0,"lat":39.6564,"lng":-106.0871}

The use of Lakeland\u2019s indoor facilities for weddings or receptions will be canceled beginning as of March 22.\n\nCleaning supplies limited\n\nIn a Tuesday email, Delgado told Lakeland city staff that cleaning supplies remain at a premium and are a challenge to obtain.\n\n\u201c ... We anticipate that in three weeks the supplies will be significantly tasked,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAn area triage plan is being enacted to better direct Lakeland\u2019s cleaning and sanitizing efforts, according to Delgado. Top priority will be given to Lakeland Police Department and Lakeland Fire Department buildings, followed by the offices of essential community services including Lakeland Electric, water, wastewater and sewer utilities.\n\nDelgado announced that non-essential city staff will aim to fully transition to a work-from-home status by end of business on March 23. Non-essential employees personally affected by school closings or other enacted COVID-19 measures, without the means to mitigate it, will be allowed to utilize sick and vacation days on a case-by-case basis.\n\nFuture COVID-19 decisions\n\nWhile the commission\u2019s decision to declare a state of emergency was unanimous, several city officials voiced concerns. Commissioner Stephanie Madden said she has full confidence in Delgado and his staff, but was hesitant to hand off so much power.\n\n\u201cWhen I see that the city manager will have the following powers, certainly we don\u2019t know if they will be required, but it does give me pause,\u201d Madden said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my job to do your job, but I know I will be held accountable for how this plays out.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Scott Franklin, mayor pro tem, said the state of emergency declaration \u201cessentially allows the city manager to just about declare martial law\u201d and wanted other mechanisms set in place.\n\nDelgado assured the commissioners that similar decision-making power had been entrusted to him in the past, such as during Hurricane Irma in 2017. In the days following Irma, the city manager said a curfew was declared for two nights in parts of Lakeland to protect businesses that were left without electrical power.\n\n\u201cWe would not make a decision of that magnitude without at least conferring with the city commission,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be held accountable as am I.\u201d\n\nCommissioner Sara Roberts McCarley asked Delgado to provide the commissioners with twice daily briefings with the latest updates on the coronavirus and what\u2019s happening.\n\nCommissioner Chad McLeod said he would be willing to have once a week commission meetings through March, then re-evaluate the situation.\n\nDelgado said he will schedule time for twice daily updates and weekly meetings, though no official vote or action was taken.\n\n\u201cThis is an unusual challenge as the health care providers said we have never gone through or never even contemplated going through this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be nimble and flexible but we don\u2019t want to take you out of the loop. I guarantee you that will not happen.\u201d\n\nCity Attorney Palmer Davis said the commissioners could call an emergency meeting if necessary to respond to an emerging COVID-19 crisis with only a few hours notice while staying in compliance with the state\u2019s Sunshine Law. Lakeland officials would be allowed to attend the meeting via teleconference or other remote technology if sick or traveling, according to Palmer, given the circumstances.\n\nMcCarley also pointed out the commission has the sole authority to declare the state of emergency has ended.\n\nCook has created a special COVID-19 section on the city\u2019s website at lakelandgov.net. It provides a running list of the city\u2019s latest actions and FAQ on the virus.\n\nSara-Megan Walsh can be reached at swalsh@theledger.com or 863-802-7545","category":"state_of_emergency","population":291281.0,"lat":28.0557,"lng":-81.9545}

In the future, the city might consider options like having staff working from home, he said.\n\nMcNees said the most important thing he wants to emphasize is that Marco Islanders need to follow the advice of the CDC and Florida Department of Health.\n\n\"If you are an elderly resident of the island who has a known compromised immune system, you certainly need to evaluate for yourself, whether the city is closing events or not or whether the city hall is open or closed, you need to evaluate for yourself what you think your risk might be,\" McNees said.\n\n\"That's something where people need to take individual responsibility.\"\n\nMore: Coronavirus in Florida: Total number of cases jumps again, bringing state total to 160\n\nOther canceled or postponed events in Marco Island\n\nMarco Island Seafood and Music Festival scheduled for the weekend of March 20\n\n2020 Business and Community Expo scheduled for March 18\n\nMarch Networking After Five scheduled for March 17\n\nMarco Island Charter Middle School's Casino Night scheduled for March 20 (postponed)\n\nAll special events of the Jewish Congregation of Marco Island through June 30 (religious services will continue)\n\nAnnual Shell Show and Shell Art Sale of the Marco Island Shell Club scheduled for March 19, 20 and 21\n\nYMCA's Dottie's Memorial Duck Derby 2020 scheduled for March 25 (postponed)\n\nAdditional reporting by Patrick Riley and Brittany Carloni.\n\nOmar Rodr\u00edguez Ortiz is a community reporter for Naples Daily News and Marco Eagle.

Ron DeSantis.\n\nAs part of a second unanimous vote, it canceled in-person meetings for all city advisory boards but left open the option for the planning and zoning advisory board and board of zoning appeals to meet virtually or by teleconference.\n\nREAD MORE \u2014 Coronavirus Update: What you need to know Tuesday, March 17\n\nAlso in that second motion was an authorization to suspend utility fees and fees associated with additional bulk waste pickup and authorization for city staff to work with nonprofits ranging from the United Way of South Sarasota County to area churches and other volunteer groups to publicize any relief efforts they may undertake during the self-quarantine period on the city website and Facebook page.\n\nThe city also opened up the option of working with the school board or other groups, to open up city facilities for expanded meal distribution, aimed primarily at keeping schoolchildren fed while schools are closed.\n\nMonday, the city closed the North Port Aquatic Center, Warm Mineral Springs, the Canine Club dog Park and the Scout House at Dallas White Park through the month of April.\n\nThe Morgan Family Community Center and George Mullen Activity Center remained open for drop-ins.\n\nDrop-in are people who use the centers for unstructured\/unscheduled activities such as basketball, pickleball, table tennis, and volleyball.\n\nThat was when the CDC recommended limiting large gatherings of 50 or fewer people.\n\nLear said that after a 2 p.m. conference call with the Sarasota County EOC, he would be able to determine what the new recommendation to reduce gatherings to 10 people or fewer would mean for those two facilities.\n\nCurrently the commission plans to meet as scheduled on March 24.\n\n#apolloLink{color:#000;background-color:#F4BE11;text-shadow: none;padding: 8px 15px 10px;font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;font-weight: 600;border-radius:10px;}\n\nRead more stories by Earle Kimel\n\nPublic comment may occur electronically. That process is still being worked out, but Lear noted it could be as simple as an email that he would then read into the record.\n\n\"We\u2019re looking at the possibility of electronic meetings where we would not even have to assemble to have a meeting,\" Lear said.\n\nCity Attorney Amber Slayton noted that quarantine issues in the future may make it impossible to have a physical quorum.\n\nWith that in mind, the city may enact ordinances that would allow for a virtual meeting, in addition to electronic public comment.\n\nLoading\u2026","category":"state_of_emergency","population":195992.0,"lat":27.0577,"lng":-82.1975}

Sign up for our Breaking News Coronavirus email\n\nDelray Beach\u2019s order, which takes effect Monday, includes a curfew restricting residents to the premises of their residences each night from midnight to 6 a.m. Palm Beach\u2019s curfew extends from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.\n\nThe moves came as Palm Beach County\u2019s confirmed cases rose to 318 Saturday, a 32 percent single-day jump and more than double the total on Wednesday, state officials said.\n\nThe number of deaths in the county rose to six, up from five Friday, and jumped statewide to 56 \u2013 an increase of 10 from the previous day.\n\n>> Palm Beach County is last in Florida in testing per capita\n\nThe county\u2019s sixth victim was a 90-year-old woman, state records show. The dead also include a 63-year-old intensive care nurse at Miami\u2019s Jackson Memorial Hospital, The Miami Herald reported.\n\nAs more cities urged residents to stay at home, Gov. Ron DeSantis called for coronavirus checkpoints on the state\u2019s highways, saying travelers arriving from Louisiana and New York on major interstates would be directed to self-quarantine for two weeks.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest that we deal with the spread that we have here now, try to blunt it, flatten the curve but we don\u2019t allow importing new infections like we may be,\" he said at a news conference Saturday.\n\nThe checkpoints would be in place on southbound Interstate 95 and eastbound Interstate 10 and are in addition to checkpoints in place at the state\u2019s major airports, he said.\n\n>>Sales boom at this Riviera Beach air purifier factory \u2014 so do jobs\n\nUnderscoring the increasing concerns, the state surgeon general sent a public safety alert to Floridians\u2019 cellphones Saturday afternoon urging anyone 65 or older or with medical conditions to stay at home. DeSantis said those messages will continue.\n\nStatewide, 4,038 people have been diagnosed with COVID-19, a 26 percent one-day increase, the figures released Saturday night show.\n\nPalm Beach County\u2019s cases increased Saturday more briskly than Florida\u2019s overall, but numbers for both are rising at a faster pace than just a few days ago. The number of cases both statewide and in Palm Beach County are now on pace to double in less than three days.\n\nWhile confirmed cases continue to rise, DeSantis\u2019 decision Friday to open a drive-thru testing center in the county is sure to yield an even greater number of cases.\n\n>>PBC firefighters poised to loan ambulance ventilators to hospitals\n\nPlans are underway to open the center at the FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach but no activity took place there Saturday. State officials did not respond to questions about the plans.\n\nThose infected in Palm Beach County range in age from 6 to 92. More women are being diagnosed in Palm Beach County, with men dropping to 53 percent of the cases from 68 percent a few days ago.\n\n>>Expectant moms face different world, new rules\n\nWith the pace of contamination quickening, state and local officials are going to greater lengths to control the spread.\n\nSaturday morning, the town of Palm Beach became the county\u2019s second city to issue a \"shelter-in-place\" order. Palm Beach has had recorded one death and six other positive cases associated with the disease, the health department reported.\n\nThe order, announced shortly before noon, says that Palm Beach residents \"are urged\" to shelter in place but stops short of requiring people remain in their homes.\n\n>>Post staffers, veterans of past disasters, don\u2019t blink in the eye of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nIt says residents are free to leave their homes to shop, go to work, visit family, worship or exercise. The town\u2019s curfew was put in place before Saturday\u2019s stay-at-home directive.\n\nLater in the day, Delray Beach announced its own stay-at-home order and a curfew, both to take effect Monday at midnight.\n\nDelray Beach City Commissioner Adam Frankel called the curfew \"reasonable,\" saying the city had begun to draw people from Broward and Miami-Dade counties where stay-at-home orders are in place countywide.\n\n\"We are trying to strike a balance between keeping people safe while allowing our businesses to operate somewhat in what if not impossible than very difficult time,\" he said.\n\n>>Readers tell us how they are coping day to day\n\nThe only other Palm Beach County city to issue a shelter-in-place order is Boca Raton. County officials have declined to go that far and Sheriff Ric Bradshaw has opposed a countywide curfew.\n\nDeSantis announced the interstate checkpoints at a news conference Saturday where he also said the state had arranged to buy doses of hydroxychloroquine from an Israeli pharmaceutical company.\n\nHydroxychloroquine is a malaria drug that has shown some early signs of helping in the treatment of COVID-19 patients but health authorities say its benefits are unproven.\n\n>>Locals are sewing masks for nurses and doctors. Do they help? It\u2019s complicated\n\nA Miami Herald reporter was denied access to DeSantis\u2019 news conference, a move that the Herald reporter attributed to a request by the Herald and six other newspapers, including The Palm Beach Post, for the governor to conduct news conferences through a digital video conference application or in a larger room.\n\nDoing so, the newspapers argued, would allow journalists to maintain \"social distance\" and still ask questions. The state suggested the reporter would be safer by skipping the news conference entirely.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office did not announce the timing of the news conference in advance and reporters who are not present cannot ask questions.\n\nDeSantis issued an executive order Friday night that orders travelers to Florida from \"an area with substantial community spread\" to \"self-declare\" and go into a 14-day quarantine.\n\nThe governor also expanded an earlier order directed at flights from New York City to include travelers from Louisiana, which has become a COVID-19 hotspot that researchers linked to the annual Mardi Gras celebration in February.\n\n>> What you can \u2014 and can\u2019t \u2014 do in Palm Beach County\n\nIn addition to the checkpoints set up this week for flights from New York to South Florida, DeSantis plans to have state troopers and sheriff\u2019s deputies screen cars for visitors from areas where there has been substantial community spread of the disease.\n\nSigns were erected along I-10 to direct eastbound drivers to a checkpoint where they were notified about the requirement. DeSantis said he planned to establish one on I-95 to catch New York travelers.\n\n\"Having the 10 and 95 (checkpoints) is good and I think that provides the protection,\" DeSantis said when asked about other routes into the state.\n\nCurrently, National Guard members greet visitors from the greater New York City area at airports in South Florida. Officials say the Guard had collected 3,406 enforcement forms from New York travelers in the past week.\n\n>>When the virus gets into the jails, most vulnerable at risk, lawyers say\n\nSouth Florida remains the epicenter\n\nSouth Florida remained the epicenter of the pandemic in Florida, with Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties accounting for more than 2,200 cases, more than half the state\u2019s total.\n\nMiami-Dade cases surpassed 1,000 for the first time, rising to 1,121; while Broward County rose to 820 from 631 a day earlier.\n\nTo Palm Beach County\u2019s north, Martin, St. Lucie and Indian River counties account for 64 cases, up from 49 Friday night.\n\nAt 22 confirmed cases per 100,000 residents, Palm Beach County has a lower rate than Broward, at 43, or Miami-Dade, at 40.\n\nThe health department said 37 patients are hospitalized with the disease in Palm Beach County.\n\nNearly half of Palm Beach County\u2019s 292 confirmed cases as of Saturday morning were in south county, with the Boca Raton area accounting for 54, Boynton Beach 41 and Delray Beach 40.\n\nThe list of retirement communities infected with the virus west of Delray Beach and Boynton Beach continues to grow.\n\nThe Valencia Palms Homeowners Association has notified its residents that the community has one confirmed case and two other residents awaiting test results\n\nAll three are recovering and have placed themselves into quarantine, said Bob Kamen, president of the homeowners association. He added that none of the three had done any traveling outside of South Florida.\n\nThe communities of Palm Isles, Coral Lakes, Valencia Falls and Majestic Isles have previously reported coronavirus cases, as has Hunters Run Country Club in Boynton Beach.\n\n>>WANT Coronavirus news as it happens?

He acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s a little iffy there\u201d right now.\n\nWith Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.\n\nThe addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.\n\nSri Lanka seals off two villages\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.\n\nThe villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.\n\nMore than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.\n\nHealth before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.\n\nMnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.\n\nBut he says President Donald Trump\u2019s top objective is the health of the American public.\n\nMnuchin tells \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.\n\nHe said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.\n\nHe said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.\n\nLouisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state\u2019s health care system.\n\nEdwards said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.\n\nHe said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.\n\nHe made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.\n\nMuscovites told to stay home\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.\n\nA video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch\u2019s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.\n\nNon-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday.

Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.\n\nMinister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.\n\nPortugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.\n\nPelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress says the government should be \u201ctaking every precaution\u201d and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.\n\nSpeaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s \u201cdenial\u201d early in the crisis was \u201cdeadly.\u201d\n\nShe says: \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.\u201d\n\nPelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: \u201cWhat did he know and when did he know it?\u201d\n\nPanama to allow cruise ships to use canal\n\nPANAMA CITY \u2014 Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\nHolland America Line said via a Facebook post, \u201cWe greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew\u201d and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.\n\nThe Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.\n\nHolland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nPanamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.\n\n50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.\n\nMany of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It\u2019s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.\n\nAnother 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797.

Please support local journalism by subscribing to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.\n\n\n\nVENICE \u2014 The city of Venice officially declared a state of emergency over coronavirus Monday morning, as city officials have canceled upcoming advisory board meetings and a planned Wednesday joint meeting between the Venice City Council and the Venice Planning Commission that would have been hosted in the county-run Venice Community Center.\n\nThe local state of emergency, which Venice City Manager Ed Lavallee signed into effect at 9 a.m., would remain in effect for seven days.\n\n#apolloLink{color:#000;background-color:#F4BE11;text-shadow: none;padding: 8px 15px 10px;font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;font-weight: 600;border-radius:10px;}\n\nSee our complete coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe order itself does not impact private businesses, but it does open up the possibility of the city receiving reimbursement from the federal government for any expenses related to the coronavirus.\n\nOn March 12, Lavallee canceled permits for all special events held on city-owned property. As part of that, the Saturday farmers market, hosted at Venice City Hall, was canceled through the month of April.\n\nBefore Sarasota County\u2019s decision on Sunday to close the Venice Community Center, the city had planned to have emergency medical personnel conduct screenings of anyone who planned to attend the joint council-planning commission meeting.\n\nThat process would also have been in place Tuesday, when the planning commission had been scheduled to meet.\n\nVenice Fire Chief Shawn Carvey said those screenings would, at the very least include a series of questions and possibly a temperature or visual wellness check, pending CDC guidelines.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to go through a list of questions, like if they walked into a hospital,\" Carvey said. \"Have they traveled, have they been around anybody that\u2019s traveled \u2014 those types of things, to eliminate any high-risk type person.\n\n\"If they answered yes to those questions, they were going to be turned away from the meeting.\"\n\nCarvey was waiting for an update during the afternoon conference call with the Sarasota County EOC, to make sure all agencies are on the same page.\n\nIn addition to canceling advisory board meetings, city officials are also reviewing the agenda for the March 24 city council meeting, and weighing whether or not to cancel that meeting as well.\n\n\"They\u2019re trying to make sure there\u2019s nothing that is time sensitive, and if there\u2019s nothing that becomes time sensitive, there\u2019s no reason to do any type of meeting,\" Carvey said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s planning commission meeting potentially had one time-sensitive item \u2014 a temporary-use permit to allow the city to relocate Fire Station 51 from the city hall campus to 925 S. Tamiami Trail, while a new station is constructed as part of the overall city hall campus renovation.\n\nCarvey said he had planned to ask for the decision to be moved to the April 7 meeting anyway, since negotiations are still under way with the property owners.\n\nMeanwhile, the decision to pull all city event permits also means postponement of the 28th annual Venice Shark\u2019s Tooth Festival, as well as the 18th annual Venice Shark\u2019s Tooth Fishing Tournament for Special Olympics Athletes, which had been set for April 2.\n\nVenice Marine Patrol Officer Paul Joyce said discussions are ongoing as to whether the tournament can be hosted later this year or if it will be postponed until next April.\n\nLoading\u2026","category":"state_of_emergency","population":23020.0,"lat":27.1164,"lng":-82.4135}

He acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s a little iffy there\u201d right now.\n\nWith Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.\n\nThe addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.\n\nSri Lanka seals off two villages\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.\n\nThe villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.\n\nMore than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.\n\nHealth before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.\n\nMnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.\n\nBut he says President Donald Trump\u2019s top objective is the health of the American public.\n\nMnuchin tells \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.\n\nHe said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.\n\nHe said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.\n\nLouisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state\u2019s health care system.\n\nEdwards said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.\n\nHe said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.\n\nHe made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.\n\nMuscovites told to stay home\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.\n\nA video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch\u2019s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.\n\nNon-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.\n\n14-year-old boy dies in Portugal\n\nLISBON, Portugal \u2014 The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.\n\nMinister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.\n\nPortugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.\n\nPelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress says the government should be \u201ctaking every precaution\u201d and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.\n\nSpeaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s \u201cdenial\u201d early in the crisis was \u201cdeadly.\u201d\n\nShe says: \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.\u201d\n\nPelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: \u201cWhat did he know and when did he know it?\u201d\n\nPanama to allow cruise ships to use canal\n\nPANAMA CITY \u2014 Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\nHolland America Line said via a Facebook post, \u201cWe greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew\u201d and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.\n\nThe Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.\n\nHolland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nPanamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.\n\n50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.\n\nMany of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It\u2019s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.\n\nAnother 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":678.0,"lat":30.6197,"lng":-85.7062}

Cuomo calls it \u2018federal declaration of war\u2019\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014President Donald Trump said Saturday that he may order an \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d for New York City and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut \u2014prompting surprise and shock from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\u201cThis would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I\u2019d rather not do it, but we may need it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCuomo likened such a quarantine to a \u201cfederal declaration of war\u201d on the city and state. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. \u2026 I don\u2019t think it is plausible. I don\u2019t think it is legal,\u201d he said hours later on CNN.\n\nSuch an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. In China, a two-month lockdown in Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, began easing only on Saturday.\n\nNew York has roughly half of the nation\u2019s confirmed cases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it and will be making a decision. A lot of the states that are infected \u2014 they\u2019ve asked me if I\u2019d look at it so we\u2019re going to look at it,\u201d Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a short flight to Norfolk, Va., for a visit to a Navy hospital ship headed to New York. \u201cIt would be for a short time.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s immediate reaction: No thanks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of it,\u201d he told reporters in Albany. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don\u2019t know what you would be accomplishing.\n\nFrance orders a billion protective masks\n\nPARIS \u2014 France has ordered more than one billion protective masks, mainly from China, to try to make up for a shortage that is being felt in nations fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced.\n\nBut French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, noting tensions in world markets, suggested at a news conference that traffickers and black marketeers are now in the mask business, given the competition in procuring the vital necessity for health workers.\n\nVeran said that an \u201cair bridge\u201d to China was being put in place, but \u201cI will have the certitude (the masks arrived) \u2026 only the minute the planes are on the tarmac.\u201d He said one major difficulty is that countries already hit by the virus remain vigilant that should the epidemic return they are equipped.\n\nAs of Saturday, France had 37,575 confirmed cases and 2,314 deaths \u2014 with 319 new deaths in the last 24 hours, health authorities said.\n\nThe prime minister warned the French that \u201cthe fight has just begun.\u201d\n\nInfant dies of COVID-19\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death.\n\nOfficials didn\u2019t release other information about the infant, who was from Cook County, which includes Chicago, including whether the child had other health issues.\n\nThe risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.\n\nChildren have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized.\n\nSeparate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill.\n\nItaly: COVID-19 crisis an \u201cappointment with history\u201d\n\nROME \u2014 Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is hoping the European Union will put together a cohesive response to the plight of countries like his, whose economy has been crippled by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nConte vowed to fight \u201cto my very last drop of sweat\u201d to prompt a \u201cstrong and cohesive European response.\u201d Conte echoed an appeal the same evening by Spain, which is also reeling under a devastating COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nConte called the crisis \u201can appointment with history. Europe must say if it\u2019s ready for this appointment\u201d to effectively deal with social and economic shock wreaked by the pandemic.\n\nGermany and the Netherlands are leading other EU nations in resisting calls for an issuance of joint European debt, colloquially dubbed \u201ccoronabonds.\u201d Italian Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri expressed dismay that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in an interview described the bond idea as a \u201conly a slogan.\u201d\n\nCrisis may delay Polish elections\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland President Andrzej Duda says the May 10 date for the presidential election may not be realistic if the coronavirus spread continues and Poland remains under the current strict isolation regime for the citizens.\n\nDuda\u2019s words were the first sign from the ruling team that the elections may not be held as planned.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party had the parliament approve changes to the electoral law to allow sick, quarantined and elderly people to vote remotely, in a clear preparation for May election.\n\nFlorida governor supports NYC quarantine\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump, tells reporters he had spoken with the president about the possibility of a coronavirus quarantine for the New York City area.\n\nDeSantis says Florida will soon set up a checkpoint along Interstate 95 to screen travellers from that area, similar to one already in place along Interstate 10 to screen people from Louisiana. Many airports in Florida also are screening travellers from certain areas, requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\n\u201cI think whatever works is what we need to do,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe\u2019re either fighting the virus or we\u2019re not. The more people are being shuttled around the country, I just think it makes it more difficult. I think it would make it a lot easier if we didn\u2019t have folks coming in from hot zones.\u201d\n\nSome South Carolina cities defy governor\u2019s opposition to stay-at-home orders\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Leaders of several South Carolina cities say they are defying Gov.

Volunteers from Italy\u2019s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.\n\nConte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: \u201cPeople are suffering psychologically, they\u2019re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.\u201d\n\nConte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.\n\nGermany: 12 die in nursing home\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.\n\nAuthorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn\u2019t shown symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nLocal officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.\n\nAnother nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.\n\nGermany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.\n\nFirst coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.\n\nOne person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.\n\nThere are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nThe Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.\n\nSpain: Future of the EU is at stake\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc\u2019s southern flank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.\n\nSanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.\n\nHe calls for a \u201cnew Marshall Plan\u201d to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.\n\nItaly and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.\n\nSpain: Commuting ban starts Monday\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.\n\nSanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home \u201cas if it were a weekend\u201d to \u201cintensify\u201d efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nSpain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.\n\nSpain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.\n\nNew Orleans one of U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 hot spots\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.\n\nThe donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.\n\n\u201cLike many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,\u201d New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.\n\nNew Orleans is one of the nation\u2019s hot spots for coronavirus.\n\nItaly\u2019s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.\n\nCivil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a one-day high in the country which has the world\u2019s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus.\n\nThe day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day\u2019s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of COVID-19 and days ago surpassed the total of China, where the outbreak began in early 2020.\n\nThe current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.\n\nU.N. donates protective masks to NYC\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the donation of 250,000 protective face masks, which had just been located in United Nations storage facilities, to the United States for use in hard-hit New York City.\n\nThe U.N. chief says: \u201cThese masks, in surplus to United Nations requirements, will be given to the medical professionals in New York City who have been working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives.\u201d\n\nGuterres says the United Nations and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office to ensure swift delivery of the masks to medical facilities around the city.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the U.N. community and the diplomatic corps, we sincerely hope this modest donation makes a difference,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nIllnesses in Detroit, a national hot spot for COVID-19, predicted to worsen next week\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to help the state address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe declaration announced by the White House on Saturday follows a back-and-forth between Trump and Gov.

More than 3,600 people in Michigan were confirmed to have COVID-19 Friday. At least 92 have died, most from the three counties in the Detroit area, according to state officials.\n\nDetroit has recorded 28 deaths and 1,166 cases, according to the city\u2019s health department.","category":"quarantine","population":678.0,"lat":30.6197,"lng":-85.7062}

Please support local journalism by subscribing to theledger.com at theledger.com\/subscribenow.\n\nWINTER HAVEN \u2014 The world continues to get smaller as the city of Winter Haven on Wednesday night joined a global list of cities, states and countries declaring a state of emergency to deal with the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nThe City Commission unanimously declared a local emergency in Winter Haven and ratified City Manager Mike Herr's decision to shut down most indoor facilities for 60 days beginning Thursday. The vote came during an emergency commission meeting called earlier in the day.\n\nThe city has also canceled meetings for most advisory and special committees for the next two months with the exception of the city and planning commissions and a few other bodies.\n\nThe city and planning commissions will be moved out of City Hall to Nora Mayo Hall to accommodate social distancing between city officials and the public attending the meetings. Wednesday's meeting was held at Nora Mayo, where commissioners and staff were seated at least six feet apart as were chairs for the public.\n\nThe list of facilities closed includes the AdventHealth Fieldhouse and Conference Center, including the neighboring Rowdy Gaines Olympic Pool; the Senior Adult Center; the Winter Haven Recreation and Cultural Center; the Tennis Center, including the aquatic splash pad playground; and the public library. All parks and trails will remain open but park buildings will be closed.\n\nThe closures are consistent with state and federal government advisories to limit gatherings to 10 people or less, Herr said.\n\nNot determined yet is whether the municipal Willowbrook Golf Course will remain open, although the clubhouse will likely close.\n\nOfficials had not yet consulted executives with Billy Casper Golf, the private company managing the course under lease with the city, Herr said. It will be addressed at Monday's regular commission meeting.\n\nMayor Brad Dantzler pushed back at closing the golf course and tennis center. He argued both sports by their nature are played in small groups and that residents need some exercise place to deal with tensions during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n\u201cTo me, this is overreach,\u201d Dantzler said. \u201cSomehow our citizens have to have some release at this time.\u201d\n\nTravis Edwards, director of the parks, recreation and culture department, said the decision to close the tennis courts was made in anticipation it would attract large crowds because of the closure of all the other municipal recreation facilities.\n\n\u201cIf you're not a tennis player, and all of the sudden the tennis center is the only thing open, you're not going to run out and play tennis,\u201d Dantzler said.\n\nThe mayor conceded when no other commissioners appeared to support him.\n\n\u201cI personally feel we need to act in the most conservative way we can because we don't know about this virus,\u201d Mayor Pro Tem Nat Birdsong said. \u201cI've heard so many times it's better to overreach than underreach.\u201d\n\nThe city will not lay off any of its 504 full- or part-time employees as a result of the closures, Herr said.\n\n\u201cFor a 60-day period, there's going to be plenty of work to keep people busy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe city manager is exploring having some municipal employees work from home or other remote site, Herr said. Top managers are compiling a list of workers who might be able to do that.\n\nHerr acknowledged, however, nobody knows whether the 60-day period will need to be extended as the nation struggles to control spread of the coronavirus.\n\nIn addition to the city and planning commissions, the police, fire and general pension boards will continue meeting because they may have to take action in light of the COVID-19 crisis, Herr said. They will also meet at Nora Mayo.\n\nThe city will also suspend any disconnections of water and sewer services for the next 60 days.\n\nThe emergency declaration allows the city manager to waive a number of restrictions on actions he can take, City Attorney John Murphy said.\n\nThat includes purchasing, including the requirement to seek competitive bids for goods and services worth more than $30,000; closing facilities; and taking some workforce actions, he said. The state of emergency will last for 60 days.\n\nKevin Bouffard can be reached at kevin.bouffard@theledger.com or at 863-802-7591.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":245237.0,"lat":28.0118,"lng":-81.7017}

Recently, Mayor Bill Grant and the city council followed suit with a local emergency ordinance under the current state and federal declarations.\n\n\"It is imperative that our citizens and businesses get behind local efforts to flatten the curve and decrease the spread of this virus,\" the city said in a press release. \"We need your help.\"\n\nOn Thursday, March 19, the mayor and council held its regularly scheduled meeting. The city council adopted an emergency ordinance which allows the mayor and council to meet via conference call during the next 90 days to conduct business of the city. It also allows the mayor and\/or city manager to adopt policies and regulations related to city personnel, limit public access to meetings to livestream only, and to restrict access to the public to city facilities. Additionally, the mayor and council cancelled all public meetings for the month of April, except for special called emergency meetings that may arise from local concerns.\n\nThe City of Canton facilities will remain closed to the public through April 13. This includes City Hall, Public Safety & Municipal Court Complex, Public Works Facility, and the Canton Theatre.\n\nThe city is encouraging individuals to do business with the City of Canton via Cantonga.gov, by calling 770-704-1500 for non-utility concerns, calling 770-704-1502 for all utility concerns, and emailing at TellUs@cantonga.gov. Additionally, the city is moving to a minimal on-site staffing level until April 10 to allow employees to telework from home, work remotely from city fleet, and to provide back up redundancy to critical city operations. Additional information about city operations can be found in this memo from the city manager.\n\nOn Friday, March 20, Grant issued an Executive Order allowing restaurants to provide package sales of beer and wine with to-go orders. The hope is that this measure will cut down on the number of individuals dining out inside restaurants and encourage take out orders, while providing support to local restaurants.\n\nCherokee County recently announced the temporary suspension of county ordinances related to the sale of unopened\/uncorked bottles of beer and wine by licensees holding a \"consumption on the premises\" license in conjunction with to-go food orders. Licensees who hold a \"consumption on the premises\" license shall be allowed to sell unopened\/uncorked bottles of beer and\/or wine in package form with to-go food orders.\n\nThis temporary suspension will remain in effect through April 30, or until reinstated by the Board of Commissioners, whichever occurs first.\n\nRelated: Coronavirus: Woodstock Mayor Allows To-Go Alcohol From Eateries\n\nAdditionally, the city is waiving penalties and late fees for utility bills, is suspending disconnects on utility accounts through April 30, and is allowing for small business hardship claims to be sent by email for extensions on business occupational license renewals and other monthly\/quarterly business filings.\n\n\n\nThe city gave other tips for businesses, faith based leaders and citizens, including:\n\nWhat can your business do?\n\nOne of the best ways to slow the spread of COVID19 is to limit public contact. While the City of Canton is not currently looking to restrict business operations, we believe it is in the best interest of the community that local businesses follow the CDC Guidelines for Businesses & Employers as well as follow the 15 Day Guidelines published by the White House to stop the spread of COVID19. These guidelines encourage citizens to avoid social gatherings of 10 or more and avoid dining in at restaurants and bars. We hope that our business community will take these guidelines as a recommendation for best business practices from the City during these challenging times. Encourage occupational limits in your facilities. Encourage to-go, delivery, and curbside services. Encourage online shopping. Please work with us to discourage large gatherings.\n\nYour business can make a big difference in the slowing of coronavirus. If you are making any operational adjustments and want us to help get out the word, please email us.\n\nWhat can our faith based community do?\n\nWe highly encourage our local churches to utilize online platforms for services. We have seen in neighboring communities the impacts of worship gatherings and the spread of COVID19. Please follow the guidelines for small gatherings. Additionally, we need our local faith based community to help provide daily social assistance to our vulnerable populations. Please call and check on your members, especially seniors and those with severe health conditions.\n\nWhat can our citizens do?\n\nThere are many ways that every person in Canton can participate in slowing this pandemic. First and foremost, stay home if you are sick! The CDC and Department of Public Health urge citizens that exhibit symptoms of coronavirus (dry cough, fever, shortness of breath) to call a local health provider, emergency room, or public health before going to those facilities. The Georgia COVID Hotline is 1-844-442-2681.\n\nFor our public that is not sick, we encourage you to practice social distancing. This means sheltering in place, limiting public contact by being considerate of distances in local grocery stores, keeping your hands clean after coming in contact with high-touch areas such as fuel pumps, ATMs, and door handles. Reach out to local restaurants and utilize to-go, carryout, and delivery services. Please do not dine in restaurants and limit your gatherings to 10 people or fewer if you must gather. You may utilize City parks and trails for exercise, but again we stress social distancing. Please discourage your children from using playgrounds as these can only be cleaned so often and are difficult to completely close down given their integration with our parks.\n\nLastly, our citizens can look out for each other. Now is a great time to clean out closets and consider future contributions to organizations like MUST Ministries, Cherokee Family Violence Center, Salvation Army, and Goodwill. There are so many others. Consider a donation to these and other non-profit organizations that are currently providing assistance for laid off workers, emergency housing, meal and bill assistance programs, and general social services. Consider providing assistance to local businesses by buying a gift card, shopping online, or just calling to say hello.\n\nCases and deaths of coronavirus continue to rise in Georgia, and as of Monday morning there have been 620 cases and 25 deaths in the state.\n\n\n\nThe number of confirmed and presumed positive cases of COVID-19 rose from 420 positive cases and 13 deaths on Friday, to 600 cases and 23 deaths across 58 counties on Sunday morning.\n\nFulton County has the most cases in the state with 111, followed by Cobb County with 67, Bartow with 56, DeKalb with 53, Dougherty with 52, Gwinnett with 27, Cherokee with 18, Lee and Carroll with 16, Clayton with 13, Richmond and Clarke with 10, and Fayette, Floyd, Coweta and Hall with nine each.\n\nGlobally, more than 351,000 people have been infected and more than 15,000 people have died from the new coronavirus, Johns Hopkins reported Monday morning.

One of the new cases did not have any travel history, meaning it was spread within Dallas County.\n\nThe county has filed for a public health emergency declaration and community gathering order prohibiting gatherings of more than 500 people. The declaration will take effect Friday at 11 a.m. and is scheduled to last one week, at this time. Those who do not follow the ordinance could be cited.\n\nDallas County Judge Clay Jenkins says the ban on public gatherings does not include schools, office towers, theaters, airports or grocery stores as long as more than 500 people are not present at once or within arm\u2019s length of each other.\n\nRELATED: Coronavirus coverage\n\n\"It is a very serious situation and one that will be getting a lot worse before it gets better,\" Jenkins said. \"But how we fare as a community will depend on all of us, and not just depending on gathering orders, but to use our brains as we're all very good at doing in this community, and ask yourself the question as you do things, 'Is this worth the risk, not just to me, but to the community?'\"\n\nHealth officials say groups larger than 250 people are highly discouraged, but they are not prohibited at this time. Those with increased risks, such as 60 years or older or pre-existing conditions, should not gather in groups of 10 or more, officials said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new cases involve a woman in her 70s, a man in his 40s, a man in his 50s, a man in his 60s and another woman in her 60s. Two of them are in the hospital while the other three are self-isolating at home. Four of the cases involve Dallas residents while one lives in Balch Springs.\n\nWhen it comes to how the five people got the virus, health officials said: two are from domestic travel, one from international travel, one is being investigated as \"likely transmission from a close contact\" and one is believed to be the community-spread case.\n\nMayor Eric Johnson issued a proclamation declaring a local state of disaster late Thursday, similar to the county\u2019s declaration.\n\nThe city manager is authorized to restrict gatherings of 500 people or more. The city is also asking that labs report the number of COVID-19 tests done daily.\n\nThe proclamation lasts for seven days and would then need to be renewed by the Dallas City Council.\n\nA meeting will be held at the Dallas City Hall at 10 a.m. Friday to discuss how the city and county are preparing.\n\nThe late Thursday announcement brings the total cases of the coronavirus in Dallas County up to eight. There are also four cases in Collin County and one case in Tarrant County.\n\nCoronavirus health tips\n\nWhile COVID-19 is a new respiratory virus, daily precautions recommended to prevent respiratory illnesses are the same:\n\n\u2022 Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer when you can't wash your hands.\n\n\u2022 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n\u2022 Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and throw the tissue away.

This includes the cancelation of municipal court through April 13. A full announcement on that is published at the end of this article.\n\nThe expanded leave policy allows employees to use unearned leave, City Manager Andrea Arnold said, and expands the time employees would need to provide medical documentation. If employees can work remotely, they will be expected to work their regularly scheduled hours. Full-time employees who cannot work remotely will be on paid administrative leave. The new policy will be evaluated every 30 days.\n\nCommissioners unanimously approved a resolution declaring a public health state of emergency which temporarily gives the mayor some emergency powers and relaxes some city regulations.\n\nDecaturish.com is working to keep your community informed about coronavirus, also known as COVID-19.

Garrett noted that city-sponsored events have been postponed, after school programs have stopped and business-related travel for employees has stopped.\n\nGarrett said the number of people restaurants over the weekend was a concern for her.\n\n\u201cIt is concerning that we have residents that are not doing this [social distancing] and we saw it over the weekend and I hope as our restaurants are continuing to be open at this point, I hope that social distancing is important enough to everyone to take those good health and protection recommendations seriously,\u201d she said.\n\nBut she stopped short of calling for those businesses to close and announced that city-owned parking would now be free for 30 minutes so people can pick up to-go orders from restaurants. Garrett said any closures would need to be coordinated with other cities and the county. The city of Brookhaven has already moved ahead with a temporary closure of restaurants and bars, except for delivery and take out.\n\n\u201cCounty and cities within the county are giving serious consideration to closing all bars and restaurants,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cWe understand the financial hardships.\u201d\n\nMayor Pro Tem Powers said there will be hard days ahead.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a challenging time,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day is going to be different which is going to require a lot of personal sacrifice and a lot of patience, but at the end of the day, we need to maintain that level of civility.

Based on what we know, we believe it is prudent to extend the actions we have already taken to protect our citizens\u2019 health and safety. Therefore, at 1:00 p.m. this afternoon the City Council and I unanimously passed an emergency ordinance to extend coronavirus protections and closures. Building on the decision to close City buildings and facilities last week, this new ordinance directs the closure of select business activities. Specifically, effective 12:01 a.m. tomorrow \u2013 March 24, 2020 \u2013 and lasting through at least April 5, 2020, all restaurants offering only dine-in options will close, as will personal grooming businesses \u2013 hairdressers, barbers, nail salons \u2013 and entertainment venues. The ordinance prohibits gatherings of more than 10 people regardless of location. Other City of Grovetown retail sales establishments will be permitted to remain open, but with restrictions. Businesses with less than 30,000 square feet of space may not have more than 10 customers inside at any one time, and businesses with more than 30,000 square feet may have no more than 50 customers at any one time. These rules do not yet apply to grocery stores and pharmacies, but residents should exercise social distancing to the maximum extent possible, remaining at least 6 feet away from one another. Grocery stores, banks, pharmacies, gas stations, and medical facilities are not included in any closures, but we ask proprietors to establish systems to keep customers and employees safe. To the extent possible, monitor customer\u2019s temperatures and provide hand sanitizer prior to entry \u2013 not admitting those running a temperature \u2013 and ensure patrons maintain adequate distances from one another, especially when in payment lines. A city curfew is not yet in effect, but the City Council will continue to proactively monitor this highly fluid situation and make decisions as circumstances warrant to keep our residents safe and healthy. Governor Kemp is scheduled to make an announcement today at 5:00 p.m. about COVID-19. Grovetown residents can expect additional announcements in the coming days from City leaders as we learn more from the Columbia County and State of Georgia Departments of Public Safety. The City Council and I continue to do all in our power to protect our citizens and ask for all citizens\u2019 cooperation with these and any new procedures. If you do not need to go out Stay Home to Save Lives.

The ordinance guarantees the continued provision of essential services and also allows for Alpharetta's elected officials to conduct meetings, including binding votes, via email.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary time in our history,\" Mayor Jim Gilvin said. \"As the elected representatives of the people of Alpharetta, it is this council's duty to make sure we can continue to conduct the business of the City of Alpharetta for the people of this community. That is why we are enacting this ordinance today; to ensure we have the ability to continue to serve and protect our citizens and our employees for the next 30 days in the face of the unusual circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nThe ordinance allows the Alpharetta City Council to temporarily vote on actions via email without advertising or convening a public meeting. It further provides that the ordinance can be extended for an additional 30 days or repealed by a majority vote of the City Council.\n\n\"It gives us the flexibility that the private sector has to make decisions more quickly and enable us to provide services without requiring people to put their health at risk by coming to or gathering in our facilities,\" Gilvin said.\n\nIn keeping with the guidance issued by federal, state, and county health officials and the emergency declaration issued by Gov. Brian Kemp, Alpharetta has already closed all its facilities to the public and cancelled all city meetings and events through April 12. While maintaining essential services such public safety, public works, and trash collection, the city has instructed all employees who can perform their duties by teleworking from home to do so. Those who must physically be at work are under direction to not gather in groups larger than necessary to complete their assigned tasks.\n\n\"We continue to closely follow the guidance issued by health professionals at the federal, state, and county level and will adjust our policies as quickly as possible as that guidance is updated to reflect this evolving situation,\" Gilvin said. \"We appreciate everyone's patience as we make these changes, and we assure the public that we will remove the measures enabled by today's ordinance as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe City of Alpharetta encourages the public to follow guidance as it is issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and has established a website to make it easy for everyone to access factual information about the Covid-19 situation, CDC guidance, and the city's response and prevention efforts.\n\nMilton City Hall closed to public; Milton City Council passes emergency ordinance\n\nAs part of efforts to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, the City of Milton closed City Hall to the public effective Monday - the same day the city council passed an emergency ordinance that extends for the next 30 days.\n\nThere will also be no further access to Milton's Police headquarters and fire stations as well as City Hall, meaning all city buildings will be closed to the public. The city has previously announced that there will be no Milton Municipal Court sessions in the coming weeks, in addition to calling off meetings, programs, and facility rentals due to COVID-19.\n\n\"The public's health and safety - including that of City employees - is our foremost priority,\" Milton Mayor Joe Lockwood said. \"We don't want to put anyone at unnecessary risk.\n\n\"Still, even if city buildings are closed, that doesn't mean city operations are closed. We will continue to serve Milton residents, providing them with the services they need and deserve, as best we can.\"\n\n\n\nThe 30-day time range for these closures and cancellations aligns with the emergency ordinance approved Monday night by the City Council. In accordance with the city's charter, the ordinance aims to \"provide for the operation of the city of Milton during the public emergency.\" Among other elements, this ordinance states that \"all matters requiring a public hearing ... are hereby stayed for 30 days.\"\n\n\"We take our responsibilities to the citizens of Milton very seriously, including the need to be as transparent and clear as possible,\" Lockwood said. \"That is why the council approved this emergency ordinance: to legally document actions we want to undertake to slow the spread of this coronavirus.\"\n\nAny permits that lapse during this time \"remain in full force,\" according to the ordinance.\n\nInitially, the city announced closures and cancellations through April 12. All those - in athletic programs, events, and the like - will now extend a few more days, city leaders will continuously evaluate the situation, and these plans may change at any time.\n\n\n\nEven with buildings closed to the public, city employees throughout government will continue to serve our citizens in myriad ways. There will still be inspections and permits issued, for instance. The Public Works Department will maintain right of way and tackle other projects. Police officers will continue to patrol Milton, working diligently to keep the city safe for all. And members of the Milton Fire-Rescue Department will keep responding to calls for fires and medical emergencies.\n\n\n\nSee more: Alpharetta\/Milton: What's Open, Closed Amid Coronavirus Concerns\n\nState Senator Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, said on Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus.

Johnson earlier indicated that he was considering this action during a video message posted on Saturday, March 14.\n\n\"I don\u2019t take it lightly,\" Johnson said of his decision to make the state-of-emergency declaration, adding that although no confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been diagnosed in Savannah by Thursday afternoon, he is certain that its spread here is imminent or already underway. \"We have reason to believe that there are unconfirmed cases out there. ... We have to be very clear about where we are.\"\n\nWith an aim toward limiting gatherings of people which could speed the transmission of the highly contagious coronavirus, Savannah\u2019s state-of-emergency declaration contains the following directives:\n\n\u2022 All bars and nightclubs that do not serve food will be closed.\n\n\u2022 Restaurants and other eating and drinking establishments must reduce seating capacity by 50 percent for dine-in services. These eateries may continue to prepare and serve food and drink via delivery, drive-through, and takeout.

City employees will soon begin working from home as directed by Monahan.\n\nThe declaration is scheduled to last through April 5, unless it is canceled or extended, Johnson said. The full City Council will need to vote on the declaration at their next meeting, scheduled for Thursday, March 26.\n\nDuring the teleconference call, Johnson also spoke with council members about other coronavirus-related issues affecting Savannah, ranging from safety measures for city employees to plans for protecting the homeless.\n\nJohnson mentioned that Chatham County\u2019s first drive-through COVID-19 site will begin operating on Saturday, March 21, under the auspices of the Coastal Health District, but stressed that it is only available to patients who are referred to be tested by a doctor.\n\nFurthermore, Johnson said that the Savannah-Chatham County Public School System will use 12 area schools as food-distribution centers for underprivileged students.\n\nAlthough Governor Brian Kemp declared that all of Georgia\u2019s public schools will remain closed until at least April 2, Johnson said that several of Savannah\u2019s campuses will continue to prepare and serve meals during the closure, including Gadsden, Brock, and Henderson elementary schools, and Groves, Savannah, and Johnson high schools.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":280082.0,"lat":32.0281,"lng":-81.1785}

Lawrenceville Mayor David Still issued a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more Friday afternoon.\n\nBoth cities had already closed many public buildings in order to reduce personal contact and prevent the spread of coronavirus. Gwinnett County has 20 cases COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nSupport real journalism. Support local journalism.

In their letter to FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn, the Senators urge the administration to swiftly change these discriminatory blood donation policies to help save lives.\n\nThe Senators write, \u201cWe write to express our concern with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) discriminatory blood donor deferral policy for men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly in the midst of a nationwide shortage of donated blood and blood products spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.

We strongly encourage you to consider this critical solution as you work to develop a comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure that Americans have access to life-saving blood transfusions.\u201d\n\nThe letter was also signed by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).\n\nThe full letter is available here and below. An online version of this release is available here.\n\nDear Commissioner Hahn,\n\nWe write to express our concern with the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) discriminatory blood donor deferral policy for men who have sex with men (MSM), particularly in the midst of a nationwide shortage of donated blood and blood products spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. We must take every possible step to secure our nation\u2019s blood supply in this critical time, and in order to do so, we need to shift away from antiquated and stigmatizing donation policies to ones that are scientifically sound, based on individual risk, and inclusive of all potential healthy blood donors.\n\nIt is vital that all Americans have access to the health care services they need during this outbreak, and for many individuals, including accident and trauma victims, organ transplant recipients and cancer patients, blood transfusions remain a necessary component of care. Unfortunately, our nation\u2019s blood supply has been severely constrained due to a decline in healthy donations. In fact, AABB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks, has predicted 355,000 fewer blood donations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nDuring this crisis, Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Assistant Secretary for Health Dr. Brett Giroir, and Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER), which oversees the safety of blood and blood products in the United States, have all expressed that blood donation for healthy individuals remains safe and is much needed. But while government health officials encourage every healthy individual to consider donating blood, the FDA continues to enforce a discriminatory donor deferral policy that effectively prohibits many healthy gay and bisexual men from doing so.\n\nWe are steadfastly committed to ending this policy and encourage the FDA to shift to scientific practices that secure our nation\u2019s blood supply based on individual risk rather than the perpetuation of inaccurate stereotypes. We have written to your agency on this subject in the past and have appreciated the FDA\u2019s willingness to engage in discussions and make changes to the MSM deferral policy. In 2015, the agency took the important step of moving from a lifetime ban to a one-year deferral policy after last sexual contact.\n\nHowever, with important advances in blood screening and safety technology, a time-based deferral policy is not scientifically sound, continues to effectively exclude many healthy gay and bisexual men, and does not meet the urgent demands of the moment. Further, with the increased uptake of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), which reduces the likelihood that an HIV-negative individual will acquire HIV, many more gay and bisexual men are aware of their HIV-negative status and are taking steps to effectively eliminate their personal risk of HIV transmission. As such, it is imperative that we move away from discriminatory donor deferral policies that prohibit many healthy individuals from contributing much-needed blood and blood products.\n\nIn light of this shortage, we urge you to swiftly update blood donor deferral policies in favor of ones that are grounded in science, are based on individual risk factors, do not unfairly single out one group of individuals, and allow all healthy Americans to donate. We strongly encourage you to consider this critical solution as you work to develop a comprehensive response to the COVID-19 outbreak and ensure that Americans have access to life-saving blood transfusions.\n\nThank you for your attention to this important issue.\n\nSincerely,","category":"None","population":349.0,"lat":38.1838,"lng":-89.8451}

Volunteers from Italy\u2019s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.\n\nConte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: \u201cPeople are suffering psychologically, they\u2019re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.\u201d\n\nConte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.\n\nGermany: 12 die in nursing home\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.\n\nAuthorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn\u2019t shown symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nLocal officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.\n\nAnother nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.\n\nGermany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.\n\nFirst coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.\n\nOne person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.\n\nThere are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nThe Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.\n\nSpain: Future of the EU is at stake\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc\u2019s southern flank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.\n\nSanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.\n\nHe calls for a \u201cnew Marshall Plan\u201d to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.\n\nItaly and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.\n\nSpain: Commuting ban starts Monday\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.\n\nSanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home \u201cas if it were a weekend\u201d to \u201cintensify\u201d efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nSpain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.\n\nSpain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.\n\nNew Orleans one of U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 hot spots\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.\n\nThe donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.\n\n\u201cLike many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,\u201d New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.\n\nNew Orleans is one of the nation\u2019s hot spots for coronavirus.\n\nItaly\u2019s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.\n\nCivil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a one-day high in the country which has the world\u2019s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus.\n\nThe day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day\u2019s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of COVID-19 and days ago surpassed the total of China, where the outbreak began in early 2020.\n\nThe current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.\n\nU.N. donates protective masks to NYC\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the donation of 250,000 protective face masks, which had just been located in United Nations storage facilities, to the United States for use in hard-hit New York City.\n\nThe U.N. chief says: \u201cThese masks, in surplus to United Nations requirements, will be given to the medical professionals in New York City who have been working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives.\u201d\n\nGuterres says the United Nations and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office to ensure swift delivery of the masks to medical facilities around the city.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the U.N. community and the diplomatic corps, we sincerely hope this modest donation makes a difference,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nIllnesses in Detroit, a national hot spot for COVID-19, predicted to worsen next week\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to help the state address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe declaration announced by the White House on Saturday follows a back-and-forth between Trump and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has criticized the Trump administration for its slow response to the pandemic, saying \u201cwe cannot weather this alone.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. surgeon general said Friday that Detroit, a national \u201chot spot\u201d for cases of the new coronavirus, will worsen next week. More than 3,600 people in Michigan were confirmed to have COVID-19 Friday. At least 92 have died, most from the three counties in the Detroit area, according to state officials.\n\nDetroit has recorded 28 deaths and 1,166 cases, according to the city\u2019s health department.","category":"quarantine","population":191.0,"lat":42.3686,"lng":-88.8939}

Volunteers from Italy\u2019s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.\n\nConte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: \u201cPeople are suffering psychologically, they\u2019re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.\u201d\n\nConte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.\n\nGermany: 12 die in nursing home\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.\n\nAuthorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn\u2019t shown symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nLocal officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.\n\nAnother nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.\n\nGermany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.\n\nFirst coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.\n\nOne person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.\n\nThere are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nThe Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.\n\nSpain: Future of the EU is at stake\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc\u2019s southern flank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.\n\nSanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.\n\nHe calls for a \u201cnew Marshall Plan\u201d to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.\n\nItaly and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.\n\nSpain: Commuting ban starts Monday\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.\n\nSanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home \u201cas if it were a weekend\u201d to \u201cintensify\u201d efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nSpain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.\n\nSpain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.\n\nNew Orleans one of U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 hot spots\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.\n\nThe donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.\n\n\u201cLike many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,\u201d New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.\n\nNew Orleans is one of the nation\u2019s hot spots for coronavirus.\n\nItaly\u2019s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.\n\nCivil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a one-day high in the country which has the world\u2019s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus.\n\nThe day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day\u2019s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of COVID-19 and days ago surpassed the total of China, where the outbreak began in early 2020.\n\nThe current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.\n\nU.N. donates protective masks to NYC\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the donation of 250,000 protective face masks, which had just been located in United Nations storage facilities, to the United States for use in hard-hit New York City.\n\nThe U.N. chief says: \u201cThese masks, in surplus to United Nations requirements, will be given to the medical professionals in New York City who have been working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives.\u201d\n\nGuterres says the United Nations and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office to ensure swift delivery of the masks to medical facilities around the city.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the U.N. community and the diplomatic corps, we sincerely hope this modest donation makes a difference,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nIllnesses in Detroit, a national hot spot for COVID-19, predicted to worsen next week\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to help the state address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe declaration announced by the White House on Saturday follows a back-and-forth between Trump and Gov.

More than 3,600 people in Michigan were confirmed to have COVID-19 Friday. At least 92 have died, most from the three counties in the Detroit area, according to state officials.\n\nDetroit has recorded 28 deaths and 1,166 cases, according to the city\u2019s health department.","category":"quarantine","population":647.0,"lat":41.9335,"lng":-88.9742}

Rosenthal's initial orders under the emergency declaration provide for expanded purchasing authority, allow emergency police and public works staff scheduling and encourage coordination with other government agencies.\n\nRosenthal said the village was facing an extreme public health risk from the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19. She said representatives of the Lake County Health Department informed village officials at least one resident had been infected.\n\n\n\n\"As has been experienced in other locales in the United States and around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to infect large number of people in a short amount of time, placing extreme burdens on the health care system and the economy,\" Rosenthal said. \"In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the village and to protect the residents of the village from this disease and death, I find that it is necessary to issue this declaration to implement emergency regulations and orders.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the village announced a family member of a Deerfield High School student had tested positive for COVID-19. The student was reported to be asymptomatic.\n\nThere were six confirmed coronavirus cases in Lake County as of Monday afternoon, although public health officials had not found evidence any of them were caused by community transmission.\n\nThe mayor's new emergency powers include the authority to impose a curfew on some or all of the city, to order businesses or streets closed and to set the maximum prices of goods or services offered within the village.

Overall, 43 cases have been reported in the U.S., both travel-related and person-to-person spread. Six deaths have been reported in Washington state as of Monday.\n\nCoronavirus causes flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In severe cases, the infection can result in death.\n\nThe first local case of person-to-person spread of the virus was reported in January when a woman who had traveled to Wuhan, China, and her husband, both in their 60s, were diagnosed and treated at St. Alexius Hospital in Hoffman Estates. Both were released in February.\n\nAnother local case was diagnosed Saturday, Feb. 29 and requires confirmation by the CDC, according to the Illinois Dept. of Public Health (IDPH), as well as a fourth case on Monday (March 2). The patient diagnosed Saturday is a man in his 70s who is being treated at Northwest Community Hospital in Arlington Heights. His wife was diagnosed Monday and is being quarantined at home, said the IDPH. Both are in good condition.\n\nPeople who may have come in contact with the couple, including two Arlington Heights Elementary School Dist. 25 employees and their children, are being monitored, said the department of public health and the district.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re following our emergency operations plan,\u201d said Pluta of Des Plaines\u2019 preparations for a potential coronavirus outbreak.\n\nDes Plaines\u2019 Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency is accredited through the Illinois Emergency Management Act and follows Illinois Administrative Code guidelines for creating emergency operations plans to help communities recover from disasters.\n\nEach emergency and disaster agency serving a specific political subdivision, such as Des Plaines, is required to have a plan that addresses public information, mass care for population, health and medical services, mortuary services and more by the time they are reviewed this September, according to the most recent version of the administrative code, updated in July 2018.\n\nPluta said the agency followed a similar plan during the H1N1 outbreak around a decade ago.\n\nCurrently, the city has about two dozen Emergency Management and Fire Corps volunteers, Pluta told the Journal & Topics. He said the volunteers respond to day-to-day emergencies and would not perform differently during a pandemic.\n\nUntil 2017, the city also had over 160 Medical Reserve Corps volunteers, though many resigned that year due to a dispute between volunteers and the city regarding paperwork and licenses. While that program is now on hold, Des Plaines is working to restructure and modernize the program with help from Holy Cross Hospital and Oakton Community College, said Police Chief William Kushner.\n\nBruce Ahlman, who helped coordinate Medical Reserve Corps and Citizen Corps volunteers until 2012, said the two groups helped purchase thousands of dollars in equipment that could help the city during an outbreak. Kushner said the city still has emergency supplies, though some supplies Ahlman said were purchased, such as N95 respirator masks, would have outlived their usefulness.\n\nApproximately one month ago, the city ordered approximately 1,000 new N95 masks. However, they have yet to be delivered due to a high demand globally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s problematic,\u201d Kushner said, adding that the masks \u2014 which require a testing process that will render about half the masks ordered obsolete \u2014 are also being sold for unusually high prices.\n\nMasks should only be necessary for those who do not want to transmit the virus to others, Kushner said.\n\nIn the case of an outbreak, the police chief said the city would work to maintain \u201ccontinuity of operations,\u201d that is, to make sure the city keeps providing necessary services to residents. If a vaccine for coronavirus is developed, this would include distribution of the vaccine to key government employees, elected officials and their families, he said.\n\nFor now, Kushner said police are also monitoring the situation and are in contact with the IDPH and CDC on a daily basis. He urged local residents to maintain hygiene habits that could prevent the spread of the virus, such as hand washing, and avoiding public places when experiencing flu symptoms.","category":"None","population":58193.0,"lat":42.0344,"lng":-87.9008}

It will be led by the mayor, acting city manager, Health and Human Services director, city emergency manager and the police and fire chiefs.\n\nHagerty has assembled a Coronavirus Task Force for the city with \"key members of the education, government, business, faith, nonprofit, health, and senior communities\" to disseminate information to their communities and to share their concerns.\n\nA special City Council meeting is scheduled for Tuesday at 6 p.m. \"to take care of some time-sensitive City business ...

Effective Thursday, Village Hall and the Public Works building will be closed to the public, a decision based on guidance from the Illinois Department of Public Health. The following are actions being taken by the Village, as stated in a news release sent to Patch:\n\nDeclaration of Local State of Emergency: Pursuant to the authority vested in the office of Village President by the Illinois Municipal Code Section 5\/11-1-6, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act Section 3305\/11 and Ordinance (O)2020-03.19 of the Village of Huntley, Village President Charles H. Sass has declared a Local State of Emergency, effective March 17, 2020. During the existence of the Local State of Emergency, the Village President shall execute such authority as provided under the Illinois Municipal Code, the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act and Ordinance (O)2020-03.19.\n\nVillage Hall\/Public Works Building Closure \u2013 Effective March 19 until further notice: After careful consideration and to protect the health and wellness of our residents and employees, the Village has made the decision to close Village Hall at 10987 Main Street and the Public Works building at 11000 Bakley Street to the public beginning March 19. This decision was based on guidance from the Illinois Department of Public Health regarding the most effective strategies to prevent the spread of illness. Plans are in place for essential services such as water, wastewater and public safety to continue without incident. There will be no reduction in services for public safety and the Village encourages residents to conduct business online, via email, mail or phone when possible. Staff will continue to be in the office to maintain all essential operations and to serve our residents via email and telephone. Staff and Village Hall contact information may be found on our website at www.huntley.il.us or by calling 847-515-5200.\n\nRelated:\n\nDon't miss local and statewide news about coronavirus developments and precautions.

All non-emergency, not-in-progress crimes should be called in to the non-emergency number at 847-515-5311 to have the initial report taken via phone. For non-emergency situations, the dispatcher will take the required information and an officer will re-contact you as soon as possible via telephone to handle your call for service. Examples of non-emergency calls include but are not limited to: theft reports, damage to property, and fraud. Additionally, certain non-emergency issues can be reported using the new online police reporting program. Residents are encouraged to use this form of reporting these types of calls to help limit face-to-face interaction with the public on non-emergency calls. As a reminder, always call 911 in an emergency.\n\nThe Medication Drop Box located in the Police lobby will be closed until further notice. To find alternative locations for this service, please see the DEA location list. Earlier this week, Huntley Police Department (and many neighboring public safety agencies) made adjustments to their response procedures. Dispatchers have begun asking additional questions regarding symptoms of COVID-19. This allows the first responders to use proper precautions when caring for our community.\n\nPolice officers will continue to physically respond to all high-priority, emergency, exigent, in progress calls that effect life safety issues. Again, always call 911 in an emergency or if you are in danger.\n\nUtility Bill Payments: At this time, we are asking the public to conduct business online as much as possible. Utility bill customers wishing to pay their bill in-person can use the drop box located in the front drive aisle of the Municipal Complex at 10987 Main Street. You can also call 847-515-5200 to make a payment over the phone using Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express. Requests for service may also be submitted online by navigating to the Finance Department home page on the Village website. The Village also offers an online payment option and automated bill payment pro gram. Should you have any questions or require any Village services, please contact us at 847-515-5200.\n\nBuilding Permits and Inspections: Building permits are now being processed through email. Permit applications and accompanying plans can be sent to inspections@huntley.il.us. In some instances, file sizes may be too large and will need to be sent via Dropbox. You will receive an e-mail from the Development Services Department confirming receipt of the permit application within one business day. If you do not receive an email or if you have questions, please call 847-515-5252.\n\nInspections of occupied homes have been suspended until further notice to limit direct contact between employees and residents. Additional inspections may be suspended or delayed depending upon the current situation. The Village will make every effort to ensure timely inspections, but for the safety and of residents and inspectors, this may not always be possible.\n\nPublic Meetings: As Governor Pritzker has ordered, all public meetings will be limited to no more than 50 people. Please consider carefully whether or not to attend any meetings. Please use precautionary measures if you choose to attend a public meeting. Please stay home if you do not feel well. Village Board meetings are recorded and posted the following day for viewing on the Village's website. Please check the Village website at www.huntley.il.us to check the status of any regularly scheduled meetings.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and please do the following to help prevent the spread of COVID-19:\n\nWash your hands frequently\n\nAvoid large gatherings\n\nStay home as much as possible\n\nKeep social distance to at least 6 feet\n\nDo not touch your face\n\nPlease be sure to check with your neighbors, especially those who are elderly or have mobility issues, to see if you can lend a helping hand in running errands or picking up groceries or other necessities.\n\nThe Village of Huntley continues to monitor the COVID-19 situation and address Village functions and services accordingly.

Trustees then extended the state of emergency until the end of the next village board meeting. O'Hara was the only elected official to attend the meeting in person.\n\n\"The Illinois Department of Public Health has now confirmed localized community person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in Illinois, significantly increasing the risk of exposure and infection to Illinois' general public, and creating an extreme public health risk in the village and throughout the state,\" O'Hara said, in the declaration.\n\nAs of 3 p.m. Wednesday, there were 22 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, among Lake County residents, according to the Lake County Health Department. The department learned of the first infected county resident a week earlier.\n\n\"As has been experienced in other locales in the United States and around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to infect large numbers of people in a short amount of time, placing extreme burdens on the health care system and the economy,\" O'Hara declared.\n\nIn her first set of emergency orders, O'Hara mandated the closure of all physical fitness facilities and membership sports and recreation clubs starting Thursday.\n\nZak Rivera, owner of Focused Results Personal Training, addressed the board before the vote. He explained the basis of his fitness business was one-on-one training and there was never more than eight people present at one time. Amid concerns over the coronavirus, he said about half of the sessions conducted by personal trainers at his facility have been conducted online and virtual.\n\n\n\n\"We've been diligent and we understand the severity of the issue, and we're just trying to operate our business as any small business owner would like to do, and also take care of our clients,\" Rivera said, asking the village president to allow him to stay open and offering to adhere to additional hygienic restrictions.\n\n\"We're trying to have our clients be safe as well as our trainers, but as our trainers \u2014 and obviously myself and my wife who own the space \u2014 are reliant on our doors to be open, or at least to be able to do virtual sessions,\" he said. \"In order to pay the trainers, for them to make a living, for us to make a living, it's pretty much imperative that we have that ability to be able to operate our business to some degree.\"\n\nO'Hara said she truly appreciated Rivera's concerns. Later in the meeting, a trustee asked the village president if an exception could be made for local small businesses to conduct one-on-one training.\n\n\"I am certainly not thrilled about having to do this declaration. But I am closing them all, and that is under my authority to do so,\" O'Hara said.\n\n\n\nDespite the hardship for affected businesses and workers, O'Hara said the public's health and safety were the paramount concerns of village leaders.\n\n\"I truly believe that at this point in time we have to do this,\" O'Hara said. \"I am hoping that it will not be for a long duration, and I truly understand how this will affect a lot of local businesses and everything else \u2014 both locally and nationally.\"\n\nThe declaration also authorized emergency purchasing and staffing measures for village employees in the police and public works departments, as needed, to protect health and safety.\n\nThe amendment to the village code and emergency declaration is essentially identical to similar such ordinances incorporated by other suburban municipal clients of Elrod Friedman, recently co-founded by Lake Bluff's village attorney. The changes define civil emergencies and extraordinary emergency authorities.\n\n\n\nThe Illinois Municipal Code grants local governments the power to declare their own states of emergency, and the firm encouraged all its municipal clients to update their codes to include the authority, according to co-founder Steve Elrod.\n\nThe order to close gyms in Lake Bluff follows the closures of Lake Bluff village, park district and library facilities to the public.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker issued a disaster declaration on March 9 and subsequent emergency orders that mandated the statewide closure of all public and private schools, a ban on gatherings of 50 or more people and a restriction on dine-in service at bars and restaurants.\n\nIn Highland Park, Mayor Nancy Rotering ordered all health clubs, movie theaters and live performance venues closed by the end of the day Tuesday after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend.\n\nLake Forest has closed all city playgrounds and all non-essential municipal buildings, and fire department officials have asked residents to limit calls to 911 to true medical emergencies, according to an announcement from city staff. Emergency personnel and public health officials requested that those experiencing only mild symptoms stay home and try to avoid infecting others.\n\nDr. Sana Ahmed, medical epidemiologist at the Lake County Health Department, asked those showing mild COVID-19 symptoms \u2014 fever, coughing, shortness of breath \u2014 to distance themselves from others in their household and using a separate bedroom and bathroom when possible. Call a doctor if the symptoms worsen.\n\n\"We are prioritizing testing for symptomatic people who have high risk of complications \u2014 older adults living in congregate settings and those with chronic health conditions like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, and those with weakened immune systems,\" Ahmed said in a release.\n\nThe moves are an effort to maximize social distancing practices, reduce the rate the coronavirus spreads in the general population and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, a public health intervention often referred to as \"flattening the curve.\"\n\nO'Hara was joined behind the dais by Village Administrator Drew Irvin and Village Attorney Peter Friedman at Wednesday afternoon's emergency meeting. They maintained a distance of at least six feet, as recommended by public health officials, to minimize the risks of transmitting the virus to one another.\n\n\n\n\"The most important message is that our residents need to stay home,\" O'Hara said in a release announcing the emergency declaration.\n\nTrustees were able to vote over the phone thanks to an executive order by the governor.

Pritzker on Friday ordered all state residents to remain in their homes except for essentials, joining similar dramatic efforts in California and New York to limit the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nPritzker's order, which takes effect Saturday at 5 p.m. and is set to expire April 7, still allows the state's 12.6 million residents to head outside to buy groceries and medicine.\n\n\u201cIf there are actions that I can take that will save lives in the midst of this pandemic, no matter how difficult, then I have an obligation,\u201d Pritzker said.

The order exempts people who work in many essential industries, including health care, manufacturing, transportation and food production or sales, including at grocery stores and restaurants.\n\nThe stay-at-home order will also mean schools statewide remain closed until April 8, he said.\n\nPritzker had previously ordered all schools statewide to shut down through the end of March and limited gatherings to 50 people to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the state. He also closed dine-in service at bars and restaurants, but allowed businesses to continue delivery or carryout options.\n\nThe governors of California and New York have issued similar orders.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who stood by Pritzker's side as he announced the order, said she agreed with the decision.\n\n\u201cThink of this as safer at home,\u201d she said.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nThe vast majority of people recover from the virus.

Now that those seven days have expired, village staff told Patch that the declaration is being renewed.\n\nWhile saying that there are \"no new circumstances\" in Plainfield's current situation, village Community Relations Director Amy De Boni added that, \"the disaster declaration will continue to be renewed throughout the ongoing COVID-19 situation.\"\n\n\n\nThis means that until such time as it is deemed no longer necessary, the emergency declaration will continue to be renewed every Monday.\n\nDeclarations of a State of Emergency allow municipalities like Plainfield to receive disaster-relief funds from FEMA should that become necessary, and to change certain protocols regarding how the village government operates.

The next two levels are when there cases that make it into Plainfield and then finally... if we have cases within the [village government] itself.\"\n\n\n\nAt present, the most drastic step the village has taken in its plans is to close all municipal facilities to the public. This step complements the 'stay at home' executive order handed down by Governor J.B. Pritzker on Saturday, asking all Illinoisans to stay home except for essential tasks. Murphy also said the next Plainfield village board meeting will likely make use of digital and teleconference technology, to limit the amount of time board trustees and meeting attendees spend together physically.\n\n\"It will be live, it may be streaming only on cable,\" Murphy said. \"It may be that we just have a conference call right here in [Village Hall] and people can listen in.\"\n\nTo learn more about Mayor Collins' emergency declaration, visit the Plainfield village website or call the mayor's office at (815) 436-7093.\n\nTo keep on top of the latest coronavirus news, subscribe to Patch news alerts and newsletters.

{"city":"Raleigh","state":"IL","publish_date":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.newsobserver.com\/news\/article241169916.html","title":"Illinois governor orders schools closed due to coronavirus | Raleigh News & Observer","text":"Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, along with elected and health officials give their daily update to Novel Coronavirus in Illinois, Friday, March 13, 2020. Tyler LaRiviere\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Friday ordered the closing of every school in the state until March 30 starting Tuesday amid concerns over the spread of coronavirus.\n\nOther states and large cities shut down schools this week over COVID-19 concerns, but officials in Illinois and Chicago resisted until Friday. Pritzker announced his decision in Chicago where more than 355,000 public school students will be affected. Statewide, nearly 2 million students will not be returning to the classroom.\n\nPritzker acknowledged that the decision will deeply affect students who receive meals at school and parents or family members who are unable to work from home. The Democrat, who has been particularly critical of the federal government's response to the spread of COVID-19 cases, said he still believes closing schools is necessary to limit the virus' spread.\n\n\u201cNone of the choices that we have had to make over the last week have been easy or simple,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cAll of these choices have cascading effects.\u201d\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nIllinois officials on Friday also reported 14 additional cases of people who had tested positive for the virus, bringing the state's total number of COVID-19 cases to 46. State officials are focused on trying to limit transmission in Illinois and hope that broader actions will help, said Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike.\n\n\u201cWe would rather be overcautious than put the health of our most vulnerable citizens at risk,\" Ezike said.\n\nA day earlier, Pritzker mandated the cancellation of events of more than 1,000 people and encouraged organizers of events with at least 250 attendees to cancel on their own.\n\n\u201cHaving the general public stay home one day at a time will have a massive effect on bending this curve,\u201d he said on Friday. \"And that means lives saved.\"\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nThe vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.\n\nThe school cancellations are the latest blow to Chicago families, where students were kept out of classes earlier in the school year by an 11-day strike by the district\u2019s more than 21,000 teachers. About 70% of the district's students are eligible for meals at school based on their families' incomes, making them particularly vulnerable to disruptions.\n\nChicago Public Schools Chief Executive Janice Jackson told reporters Friday evening that all district schools and offices will be closed Tuesday for everyone with the exception of essential personnel.\n\n\u201cThe district will be providing meals to all of our students and families,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAll of our CPS locations will be food distribution centers beginning on Tuesday, March 17 at 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. every single day throughout the closure. Families will be able to pick up three days\u2019 worth of food at any given time for each child that lives in their household.\u201d\n\nLearning packets for students will be available Monday.\n\nFull-time and regularly scheduled district staff will be paid throughout the closure, Jackson said. Most central office staff will be asked to work remotely.\n\nPritzker said state officials are working to plan food delivery to students' homes or to neighborhood facilities around the state. He also said the state has granted access to unemployment benefits to people unemployed due to concerns about the coronavirus.\n\nState Supt. Carmen Ayala encouraged school districts to provide activities that students can do at home but said administrators for each district have \u201cfull autonomy\u201d to make their own decisions.\n\nThe closing of K-12 schools comes the same week that many large universities in Illinois suspended in-person classes due to concerns about the virus, including the University of Illinois, Southern Illinois, DePaul, Northwestern and Illinois State universities.\n\nOn Thursday, the Illinois High School Association limited attendance at the remaining games in this year\u2019s 2020 boys basketball tournament and other sporting events.\n\nDozens of school districts and schools had canceled on their own earlier in the day, including the Archdiocese of Chicago.\n\n\u201cIn light of (Pritzker's order) the best place for our students to be is at home,\u201d said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who also appealed Friday to the city\u2019s business community to work with \u2014 and be flexible with \u2014 employees who are parents of students.\n\n\u201cThese are not ordinary times and we need employers to be in partnership with their employees,\u201d Lightfoot said.\n\nUnder new workforce policies, city workers impacted by COVID-19 will be given additional paid time off and permitted to work from home when possible, she added.\n\n\u201cNo parent should be forced to pick between staying home with a child and earning a paycheck,\u201d Lightfoot said.\n\nIn addition to schools, other closures announced Friday in Illinois include casinos. Starting Monday, the state's 10 casinos must suspend gaming operations for 14 days, according to the Illinois Gaming Board.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the Archdiocese of Chicago is closing 170 schools with 51,000 students, not 205 schools with 71,000 students.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

If an individual doesn\u2019t have a primary care physician, several health care systems are providing telehealth services so residents may be evaluated by a provider without having to leave their homes.\n\nIf it\u2019s determined an individual should be tested, they will be instructed where to go to be tested.

They are doing it because they are concerned for their children and because they are told to keep children home if possible. But mostly they are doing it because childcare is expensive. When families lose their income, childcare is an obvious place to cut.\n\nBut once families pull out, the government subsidies that fund wages and rent for childcare centres go, which forces our education and care centres to close their doors eventually.\n\nChildcare and coronavirus: Australian families won't be penalised for keeping children home Read more\n\nThey have been told they have to stay open to care for the children of essential workers and for children whose parents are working from home and can\u2019t work with a toddler underfoot. But the centres can no longer afford to stay open.\n\nNorthside Community Services runs five long day cares in Canberra. Their executive director, Anna Whitty, puts it this way:\n\nAs a provider of early education, we\u2019ve never had to deal with a crisis like this. Families are concerned, and understandably have been ending their children\u2019s enrolments and keeping them at home. This has had an immediate and direct impact on our financial situation, which will only continue to get worse. We\u2019ve committed to doing everything we can to keep paying our incredible team of educators across our centres, but we can\u2019t keep that up forever \u2013 like every other early education provider we are facing incredibly difficult choices at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe ex-director of an out of school hours care service in Western Australia says:\n\nWe are community managed and operated out of a school site. The management committee decided to close the service because we only had a few children still coming. All our educators were casual. They were given the option of becoming permanent part-time last year but they couldn\u2019t afford to \u2013 the casual loading was what made their jobs possible. So they are now all gone.\u201d\n\nGoodstart Early Learning, one of Australia\u2019s largest providers, had to lay off 4,000 casual educators last week.\n\nMelinda Gambley is the director of a state-funded preschool in northern New South Wales.\n\nShe says:\n\nAs of now, we\u2019re still open, but we don\u2019t know when this could change. We went from 32 children attending, to just two by the end of last week. Parents and staff are anxious about their children, their own health and passing the virus on to their families. Our children\u2019s families work in or own small businesses in tourism or hospitality. Many have lost their jobs or businesses. All are worried about money. Our staff keep showing up day after day, despite the risks to their own health, but they don\u2019t know if they will have jobs to return to after the Easter break. None are paid well enough to have money set aside for a rainy day. And the children! Their routines have changed. They\u2019re confused and sad. For some of them, we are their first relationships outside of their immediate family. They miss their teachers and their friends. One little girl said this week: \u2018I\u2019m really sad \u2018cause I\u2019ve got no brothers and sisters to play with and now I\u2019ve got no friends at preschool either\u2019. We miss the ones that are at home and we worry about them. We hope they are all safe.\u201d\n\nUnlike schools, childcare services are not actually government funded. Instead, parents pass on to centres the subsidies they receive and pay the gap fees.\n\nOn top of this convoluted method of funding, successive governments have increasingly privatised the whole gig. Our long day cares are now as likely to be run by large corporate providers and small businesses. Our out-of-school hours services are either owned by multinational private equity firms, or they are not-for-profit, or parent run. There is also no clear constitutional divide as to who should fund services either \u2013 the states or the commonwealth \u2013 which adds to the complexity.\n\nThe government should be paying more for childcare. Instead families are struggling with costs | Jen Jackson for the Conversation Read more\n\nThe childcare subsidy is a dog\u2019s breakfast of rules and legislation. One of the last days that parliament sat, it passed changes to give the government some outs to this. But until services are actually closed, no funds are available. Services can\u2019t even remove the gap fees for parents without committing fraud. The government opened a small grant program and now has to process over 14,000 applications. This won\u2019t happen fast. There are ways for parents to claim higher subsidies, but these all involve myGov.\n\nThe educators and directors who are desperately trying to keep these services afloat are of the opinion that this is all barmy. The bureaucrats are so wedded to their complex funding models that they can\u2019t think outside those models.\n\nThere was $8bn allocated to childcare in the last budget. All it would take to keep the sector running is to pay some of this money directly to each service, and bingo \u2013 we could continue to provide childcare to every child and family that needs it.\n\nBut unless this happen this week, services will close, and their educators will scatter.\n\nWhen our nurses and doctors can\u2019t turn up to their jobs because they have no one to look after their children there will be an uproar.\n\nBy then it will be too late to re-open them.\n\n\u2022 Lisa Bryant is an advocate for education and care in Australia and a consultant to education and care services","category":"None","population":250.0,"lat":40.5358,"lng":-84.9633}

But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths.

Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":2113.0,"lat":39.5211,"lng":-86.7995}

Board President Robert Fisher and Interim Superintendent Rick Dunlap, Jr. were televised from the board conference room, while other board members participated from home.\n\nDunlap, who said schools will now be closed until April 14, thanked the community for its support and warned the pandemic and economic downturn will likely mean the loss of an additional $500,000 in local revenue from sources including property taxes, and there will be further belt-tightening.\n\nThe school board, acting on legal advice, approved disaster emergency resolutions authorizing the superintendent to continue to pay bills, pay professional staff and excuse some staff from work, but with pay and benefits. The emergency powers will extend to June 30.\n\nResident C. Peter Barringer accused the school district of \u201ctaking advantage of a global situation.\u201d He was among several citizens who expressed concern about the school district making decisions prior to board meetings without checks and balances.\n\nResident Karen Russo complained the school district does not \u201chave its act together\u201d in providing instruction for students stuck at home, but according to the parent advocacy group CCAP, Coatesville Community and Parents, some teachers are providing online learning.\n\nIn an effort to help the district offer all students remote learning on Chromebooks, the school board awarded a $42,500 contract to Build Something Different. The firm will receive a $35,000 PAsmart grant and $7,500 from the district to work with staff and build an online learning platform. Students are also receiving free grab-and-go breakfasts and lunches at numerous community sites.\n\nAlso visible during the meeting was James Bookman, of Coatesville, selected by the school board to fill the unexpired Region 1 seat of Jill Santiago, who recently resigned.

And, much like Charleston\u2019s stay at home order, Columbia\u2019s measure has broad exceptions which will allow \u201cessential\u201d businesses and functions \u2014 such as grocery stores, gas stations, media, pharmacies, takeout and delivery restaurant services, manufacturing businesses, banks and insurance offices, commercial and residential construction and repairs, and many, many others \u2014 to continue to operate if they so choose.\n\nCity Council passed the measure during a Thursday afternoon meeting. The vote was 6-1, with Councilman Daniel Rickenmann voting \"no.\"\n\nThe order \u2014 which the city calls Stay Home, Stay Safe \u2014 would go into effect at 12:01 a.m. March 29. The order says that, after that time, \u201cindividuals shall stay in their homes and not travel through or congregate in the streets, sidewalks, waterways and\/or public spaces in the City of Columbia\u201d unless they are traveling to work or do business with one of the long list of essential services that are allowed under the measure.\n\nThe city is ordering those functions operating under the guise of essential services to enforce \u201csocial distancing\u201d of at least six feet between people.\n\nOutdoor activity and exercise is still be allowed under the stay at home order, though the measure says citizens should \u201climit outdoor recreational activities to those that allow for social distancing of at least six feet, do not entail coming into close contact with other people or involve the sharing of equipment.\u201d\n\nThe stay at home order is good for 14 days, but the city could go back and extend it if need be.\n\nColumbia\u2019s edict for people to stay at home is just the latest in a string of measures that have been put in place in the Capital City and across South Carolina in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, the lethal virus that has touched off a global pandemic. Columbia currently is under a nightly curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Gov. Henry McMaster has given law enforcement leeway to break up any groups larger than three people in public. The governor has also shuttered all dine-in services at bars and restaurants across South Carolina and barred groups from congregating on the state's beaches.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that residents and non-residents of this great city shelter at home, unless providing or requiring an essential service,\u201d City Council\u2019s March 26 order reads.\n\nMuch as as it has done across the rest of the country, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across South Carolina. According to numbers released by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control, as of the afternoon of March 25 there were 424 cases across 39 counties in South Carolina.\n\nThird-term Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said Thursday that he thought a stay at home order was the appropriate next step for a city that is desperate to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"We've been on a smart path, a responsible path, trying to do every single thing we can possibly do to curb the growth of this virus in our community,\" Benjamin said.\n\nAs of March 25, eight people had died from the novel coronavirus in South Carolina. Among them was Jack West, the longtime Statehouse lobbyist and son of former Gov. John West.\n\nSecond-term Columbia City Councilman Howard Duvall, 77, told Free Times he was in favor of a stay at home order.\n\n\"We want to ask people to accept the seriousness of this situation, and start behaving like it is a very serious situation,\" Duvall says. \"Even if you are young and might be able to survive this thing, it is up to all of us to accept the responsibility. It doesn't do me any good, being 77, for a 20-year-old to think they are not going to get it, then give it to me.\"\n\nColumbia had an eye on what Charleston did earlier this week as it crafted its draft stay at home ordinance, including its vast list of \"essential services\" exceptions.\n\n\"We tried our best to replicate the list that Charleston used in the interests of consistency,\" Benjamin tells Free Times.\n\nAs noted by The Post and Courier, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said that city's staff modeled the proposed list of essential businesses on recommendations from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nColumbia's measure has a wide array of essential services that are exempted from the stay at home order.\n\nFor instance, in the manufacturing sector, it lists \"food processing, manufacturing agents, including all foods and beverages, chemicals, medical equipment\/instruments, pharmaceuticals, sanitary products, telecommunications, microelectronics\/semi-conductor, agriculture\/farms, household paper products, vehicle and aircraft manufacturing\" as exceptions.\n\nEssential retail operations in the order include \"grocery stores and all food and beverage stores, pet stores that sell food and or medications, big box stores or wholesale clubs that have in-house grocery or pharmacy services, pharmacies, convenience stores, direct farm to consumer sales, gas stations, restaurants\/bars (but only for take-out or\/delivery), hardware and building material store and online retailers that deliver products and services to individual's homes or businesses.\"\n\nBanks, credit unions and check cashing services, insurance, payroll, accounting, services related to financial markets and legal services also are listed among the wave of essential services that could continue operating under the proposed measure.\n\nTo see the full draft order, and list of essential services that are excepted, click here.\n\nRickenmann had reservations about the stay at home order. In a statement sent to Free Times, he said such an order is \"the most drastic action any government can take.\"\n\nHe says he thinks Columbians have been doing a good job social distancing without having a city edict.\n\n\"We\u2019re already two weeks into a drastic shutdown of our economy,\" Rickenmann says. \"To close even more businesses for two more weeks could have devastating impacts on our small businesses that can\u2019t afford to stay closed a month. Many may never re-open. The solution to this crisis is to continue to do what we\u2019re doing well and ask everyone high-risk to stay home. If they don\u2019t have families or neighbors to help buy groceries or get medicine, let\u2019s organize that help. But they need to self-quarantine. That\u2019s critical.\"\n\nMeanwhile, District 2 Councilman Ed McDowell said during the meeting that Council is tasked with considering the \"human loss\" potential of COVID-19, and that public health was at the top of his mind when considering the stay at home order.\n\n\"We are in a human crisis that says, 'We have to do our part,'\" McDowell said.\n\nAs for the police department enforcing the stay at home order, Benjamin said at a Thursday night news conference that the Columbia Police Department would use \"common sense and compassion.\"\n\nBenjamin was also asked about the fact that McMaster has not issued such an order statewide.\n\n\"It's the governor's prerogative,\" the third-term mayor said. \"We have led from the front on this issue. We have not paid attention to political desires or even personal desires. We have followed the data. Good data allows you to make good decisions.\n\n\"We have never seen anything like this in over 100 years in this country. It requires thoughtful public health professionals be listened to, and that elected leaders enact policies that help us slow down the curve and the spread of this virus and save lives. That's our goal here. Hopefully the governor will follow suit. I'm not sure that he will.\"","category":"shelter_in_place","population":9535.0,"lat":41.1612,"lng":-85.4855}

Ginther is using to grant emergency powers during the pandemic offer no language specifically spelling out in what forms mayoral orders are to be made. There's also no requirement to keep a journal of contracts issued and city laws waived, City Attorney Zach Klein said.\n\nThe early 1970s-era city ordinances that Columbus Mayor Andrew J. Ginther used last week to grant himself emergency powers offer little guidance on the mechanics of how the mayor is to run Ohio's largest city until the coronavirus threat subsides.\n\nThey allow Ginther to suspend the enforcement of city codes \u201cas he sees necessary,\u201d for as long as six months, unless terminated earlier by the Columbus City Council. He can unilaterally issue city contracts without limitation, bypassing the normal city council channels, after providing council members with a written explanation \u201cfor the selection of the chosen contractor.\u201d\n\nThe ordinances granting the emergency powers offer no language specifically spelling out in what forms mayoral orders are to be made, such as verbally or in writing, and no requirement to keep a journal of contracts issued and city laws waived, City Attorney Zach Klein said in an interview last week.\n\n\u201cThe Columbus city code is silent to that,\u201d Klein said.\n\n>> This story is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. You can find more stories on coronavirus here. Please support local journalism by subscribing to The Columbus Dispatch at subscribe.dispatch.com.\n\nThe city's voluminous purchasing code says that in times of emergency, the mayor may unilaterally make contracts \u201cfor the procurement of materials, supplies, equipment, construction or service\u201d without complying with its provisions.\n\nGinther spokeswoman Robin Davis said that since signing the executive order Wednesday, the administration had waived four city code requirements. One dealt with cleanup from recent flooding; one with deadlines for a Sullivant Avenue project using state and federal dollars; one for a computer contract; and one for the Division of Power to install streetlights.\n\nThe state of emergency ensures the city can provide essential city services, Davis said in an email.\n\n\u201cClear direction has been sent to the directors on how to request and document these waivers,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThe city auditor has established a specific code to track expenditures for COVID-19. Any procurement not critical to COVID-19 will go through normal procedures.\u201d\n\nOn March 13, Klein sent Ginther and the city council a memo explaining that he had been asked to outline local emergency powers afforded the mayor in emergencies. Because of the \u201chome rule\u201d provisions of the Ohio Constitution, the city creates much of its own laws and rules, it says.\n\nThe executive power under the city charter is vested in the mayor, who has the duty of \u201cchief conservator of the peace\u201d and to see that all city ordinances are enforced.\n\nA 1971 ordinance says that \u201cwhen there is tumult, riot, mob or body of people acting together with the intent to commit a felony,\u201d or during a flood, fire, snowstorm or \u201cany other disaster affecting life and property\u201d that impairs the functioning of the city, any of the following officers in order can declare an emergency: the mayor, the city council president, the director of public safety and the police chief, Klein's memo explained.\n\nWhen a state of emergency has been declared, any of those people who find themselves in charge can \u201cissue such proclamations as he deems necessary to protect life and property,\u201d specifically including curfews, stopping alcohol and gun sales, and restricting movements of people and assemblies.\n\nThese sections of the ordinances don't say how long this could continue. Ginther's order says it will end when Gov. Mike DeWine ends the statewide declaration of emergency.\n\nOn March 16, Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin's chief of staff, Michael S. Brown, said that Hardin had decided that the council would not meet again until April 20, \u201cbarring an emergency calling us back.\u201d The council held its last meeting that day, with a majority of members voting from remote locations via teleconferencing technology, under guidance from the state auditor.\n\nIn a \u201cceremonial resolution\u201d that night, the council voted unanimously to express support for Ginther \u201cshould he invoke and utilize the emergency authority vested in his office.\u201d\n\nThough the city code doesn't specifically ban the mayor from making verbal orders to nullify existing ordinances, \u201cit's definitely not a verbal process,\u201d Councilwoman Elizabeth Brown said of Ginther's powers to act.\n\n\u201cThese are extraordinary times, and mountains must be moved to protect health and well-being \u2014 in a day's time let alone a week's notice, which is the council meeting schedule.\u201d\n\nEven though the council is currently suspended, members are still in close contact with the administration, said Councilman Rob Dorans.\n\n\u201cWe know that this crisis isn't going to pass quickly, therefore it was important to ensure that the mayor has the authority to keep the basic functions of the city operating without city council meeting due to the safety concerns involved,\u201d Dorans wrote in an email. \u201cThe executive order will help do so.\u201d\n\nUnder the city charter, the auditor is the \u201cchief accounting officer,\u201d responsible for processing, recording, maintaining and reporting all city financial transactions \u201cin accurate, systemized detail.\u201d\n\nCity Auditor Megan Kilgore said should her office need to process payments over $50,000 that normally would require city council approval, her protocols will call for the mayor to submit a written request indicating the project, its purpose under the state of emergency, and include appropriate signatures and approvals.\n\nAfter the emergency passes, the division or department making the request will follow up with the city council to obtain an ordinance, Kilgore said.\n\nbbush@dispatch.com\n\n@ReporterBush","category":"None","population":58771.0,"lat":39.2094,"lng":-85.9183}

Rowlands \u2014 Wednesday, March 18th, 2020\n\n\n\nCity of Fillmore City of Fillmore\n\nThe City of Fillmore has declared a Local Emergency due to the Public Health threat caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19). Although there are still zero confirmed cases in Fillmore, the declaration is out of an abundance of caution to protect the health, safety, and welfare of our community members and employees. This action is in response to the Ventura County Public Health Department\u2019s recent announcement declaring a local emergency and the Governor\u2019s recent declaration of a state of emergency. The City of Fillmore\u2019s emergency declaration will enable City officials and staff to mobilize resources, formalize an emergency action and contingency plan, and obtain additional resources should an outbreak occur in the City.\n\nAs of March 12th, 95 people have been tested by the Ventura County Public Health Lab for COVID-19, 2 results are pending confirmation and 22 travelers are on home quarantine. COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is easily spread through personal contact, which can lead to serious illness or death for vulnerable members of the community.\n\nThe City of Fillmore is following the Ventura County Public Health Department\u2019s latest recommendations and the State\u2019s public health experts to cancel and postpone community events and gatherings where large groups are expected. Consequently, the City of Fillmore is implementing the following precautionary measures:\n\n- Cancellation and postponement of March, April and May community events including\n\nSaint Patrick\u2019s Day Fun Run, Easter Egg Hunt, Community Art Show, and the May Festival.\n\n- Any facility rentals will still be held as scheduled.\n\n-\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience these measures may have caused, however the well-being of our community and staff is the City\u2019s highest priority.

You do not need to call Public Health to request COVID-19 testing. Your doctor will make the decision to test at one of the local private labs and if the test is positive your doctor will contact Public Health for confirmation.\n\n- If you have questions, please call the clinic or your doctor before going in. If you do not have a healthcare provider, call 211 for assistance finding support near you.\n\n- Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n\n- Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\n- Get immunized against the flu to protect yourself and your family, and reduce the potential strain on the healthcare system, which may be impacted by COVID-19 concerns.\n\n- Stay home if you are sick.\n\n***\n\nA PROCLAMATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF A LOCAL EMERGENCY BY THE DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PURSUANT TO FILLMORE MUNICIPAL CODE SECTION 15.04.060(A)(1), CALIFORNIA (COVID-19)\n\nWHEREAS, in December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (a disease now known as COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan City, Hubie Province, China; and\n\nWHEREAS, COVID-19 has since spread outside of China, impacting more than 75 countries, including the United States; and\n\nWHEREAS, the California Department of Public Health has activated its Medical and Health Coordination Center, and the Office of Emergency Services recently activated the State Operations Center to provide support and guide actions to preserve public health; and\n\nWHEREAS, on March 4, 2020, Governor Newson declared the existence of a state of emergency for the State of California; and,\n\nWHEREAS, on March 12, 2020, the County declared the existence of a local emergency for Ventura County; and,\n\nWHEREAS, it is imperative to prepare for and respond to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases within the City, and to prepare to respond to an increasing number or individuals who may require medical care; and\n\nWHEREAS, California Government Code Sections 8558 and 8630, et seq., and Fillmore Municipal Code Section 15.04.060(a)(1) empower the City\u2019s Director of Emergency Services to declare a local emergency if the City Council is not in session; and\n\nWHEREAS, the City Manager of the City of Fillmore is designated as the Director of\n\nEmergency Services pursuant to Municipal Code Section 15.04.050(a); and\n\nWHEREAS, the City Council of the City of Fillmore is not in session and cannot immediately be called into session; and\n\nWHEREAS, strict compliance with certain Fillmore Municipal Code and other City regulations could prevent, hinder, or delay appropriate actions to prevent and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19, which issue cannot be timely addressed absent a declaration of emergency; and\n\nWHEREAS, on March 13, 2020, the City\u2019s Director of Emergency Services declared a local emergency thereby activating the Emergency Operations Center due to threats to people within the City from COVID-19, which threats are likely to be beyond the control of the services, personnel, equipment and facilities of the City and will likely require the combined forces of the other political subdivisions of the county, state and federal government; and\n\nWHEREAS, per Government Code Section 8630 a local emergency declared by the Director of Emergency Services shall not remain in effect for a period in excess of seven days unless it has been ratified by the City Council.\n\nNOW THEREFORE BE IT PROCLAIMED THAT the Director of Emergency Services, hereby declare as follows:\n\nSECTION 1.

The declaration came after a 7-0 City Council vote to amend the city code to create a process for civil emergencies and was followed by another unanimous vote extending the state of emergency until the next council meeting.\n\n\"It will not go on indefinitely,\" Rotering said. \"We are scheduled to meet again April 6. But, within the resolution, there's also the opportunity to call a special meeting, as we have today. So we can call a special meeting in a week, we can call a special meeting in two days, whenever it's necessary to end these powers.\"\n\n\n\nMost local governments in the state have not incorporated authority granted by the Illinois Municipal Code to declare their own states of emergency, Corporation Counsel Steve Elrod explained. He said his firm Elrod Friedman encouraged all its municipal clients to put such provisions on their books.\n\n\"We are in interesting times and very fluid times, dealing with a state of emergency that has been called at the not only at the national level but at the state level,\" Elrod said. \"There are certain powers that have been codified into Illinois statute that would currently appear, without any further action by the City Council, [to] allow the mayor and the city manager ... to exercise certain extraordinary powers. Many of those powers have not been tested in the 150-year existence of the city of Highland Park, and in my opinion, ought to be confirmed by the corporate authorities.\"\n\nThe initial orders were limited to a direction for city officials to coordinate with other public bodies in the state, implementing emergency staffing protocols for employees of the city's fire, police and public works departments, and executing emergency contracts. The ordinance and the emergency declaration allow for additional emergency regulations and orders.\n\nLate Monday, Rotering issued a supplemental orders shuttering all health and recreational clubs and all motion picture and live performance theaters starting at the close of business Tuesday. The move followed an executive order issued earlier in the day by Gov. JB Pritkzer implementing a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more and shuttering dine-in restaurants and bars.\n\n\"It is difficult to order the closure of businesses within our community, however, theaters, health clubs, and recreational clubs naturally result in individuals interacting in close quarters. As we've seen worldwide, an effective method to combat COVID-19 is maintaining significant distances between people,\" Rotering said. \"After discussions with the City Council, City Manager and evaluating guidance provided by the CDC and Illinois Department of Public Health, it became clear that the closure of such facilities was necessary as we work to diminish the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nCity Manager Ghida Neukirch reminded the community that emergency services will remain available, even as municipal buildings close to the public.\n\n\"The general public is encouraged to take social distancing practices and adhere to public health recommendations for staying healthy,\" Neukirch said. \"Please know that your city is in close communication with our government partners in Highland Park, with state and federal agencies, with neighboring municipalities, Highland Park Hospital and, really, the entire community.\"\n\n\n\nCoronavirus In Illinois: March 16 Update: Don't miss updates about precautions in the Chicago area as they are announced. Sign up for Patch news alerts and newsletters.\n\n\n\nIn a statement at the March 14 emergency meeting, after declaring the state of emergency, Rotering urged residents to support one another and heed warnings from public health officials.\n\n\"This week has seen dramatic steps being taken to accelerate social distancing in an effort to slow down the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the anticipated challenges to our health care system. In recent days, our city has experienced the closure of all public access to city buildings except the police station, the senior center, the library, all schools, all park district facilities, Ravinia Festival, the art center and more. While these steps may seem extreme, they are advised by the careful guidance of the Illinois Department of Public Health, which urges all Illinois residents to reduce social contact as much as possible,\" she said.\n\n\"I cannot stress this enough: stay home. Let's do everything we can to minimize social contact and slow the spread of this virus. If your kids are home or coming home from college, please keep them at home. This is not a time for gatherings \u2014 for hanging at friends' houses. We know that younger people tend not to show major symptoms of the virus yet shed the virus into their environs.

I urge you, call Lake County Health,\" Rotering said. \"Anyone who is not feeling well should seek medical care without fear. Documentation status will not be checked before care is provided. It's critical that everybody get medical help if needed as quickly as possible.\"\n\nRotering also asked the community to consider how to support the most vulnerable in the community. The mayor said the Moraine Township food pantry needs donations from the public at its office at 800 Central Ave. Goods can be dropped off weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. outside the office. Needed this week: oatmeal, canned fruit or fruit cups, cereal, crackers, tuna, mac & cheese, pasta, pasta sauce and paper bags with handles. The township also accepts donations. Call 847-432-3240 for more information.\n\n\"Please check on your neighbors. As we self-quarantine and socially distance ourselves, concerns about seniors and others becoming isolated are critically important, and while the city is offering well-being checks, we need everybody's help. Think about your neighborhood. Think about your network. Who's living alone? Who might get sick with nobody knowing? Who might run out of food or medication with no way to get help? Every one of us knows people who are elderly, or disabled or living alone or otherwise unable to get what they need during this crisis. Please, make a plan to check on them daily. It can be by phone, it can be by email, it can be by a door knock and then a few steps back from the door, if they're sick. Let's keep an eye on everybody. Nobody should be left alone during this crisis,\" she said. \"If we all, street by street, block by block, think of who needs to be checked on, we can keep all members of our community safe, and if that friend, or neighbor, or family member does not respond, please call the Highland Park police and they will check up on them.

But the number of staffed hospital and intensive care unit beds in the county amounts to about 5,500, Haberle said.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, we can\u2019t build more hospitals overnight,\u201d Haberle said. \u201cWe really need to slow the spread of the disease going forward.\u201d\n\nHotels and other tourist-oriented businesses that pay into the city\u2019s transient occupancy tax are expected to see a sharp decline in revenue due to fewer people traveling \u2014 at least a 20% decrease in reservations over the next 3\u00bd months, Chi projected.\n\nOfficials estimated a loss of $2.5 million to $3 million in the transient occupancy tax, plus $1 million to $1.5 million in sales taxes, for a total loss of $3.5 million to $4.5 million for the city.\n\n\u201cThe local hotel industry in Huntington Beach is really one of the bedrocks of our local economy,\u201d Chi said. \u201cThose ripples go throughout our entire economy.\u201d\n\nThe city has been in touch with the Small Business Administration to help local businesses access funding, Chi said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of its response plan, the city also will cancel all work travel, not schedule events with more than 50 people and potentially cancel some commission and community support meetings. City staff also is meeting with community groups, such as the local interfaith council, to coordinate responses for higher-risk populations, Chi said.\n\n\u201cWe kind of do what we\u2019re doing here, so it\u2019s not so much worried about us getting the flu or me getting the flu, it\u2019s me transmitting it to somebody else who may not have the wherewithal to combat it,\u201d Councilman Mike Posey said.\n\nSupport our coverage by becoming a digital subscriber.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":17886.0,"lat":40.8816,"lng":-85.5054}

A Callahan Elementary School staff member reported last week she had been exposed to the virus, but school officials said she has not shown symptoms.\n\nThe emergency declaration followed McGee\u2019s announcement late Sunday night that Lynn City Hall, the city\u2019s Department of Public Works and the Lynn Public Library would be closed to the public until further notice.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in Massachusetts increased to 197 on Monday, an uptick from the 164 that were reported on Sunday, according to the state\u2019s Department of Public Health.\n\n\u201cIn light of this truly unparalleled situation, the city is taking these precautionary measures in order to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19 within our own community,\u201d McGee said in a statement. \u201cWe are urging residents of all ages to regularly practice social distancing in groups of any size.\u201d\n\nResidents are strongly encouraged to conduct any City Hall business by phone or online, but should anticipate delays in response as city offices will be minimally staffed. Consideration should be given to delaying matters that are not time sensitive, according to McGee.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s order to close city buildings, which came on the heels of statewide restrictions announced by the governor Sunday night, does not apply to emergency services, including the Lynn Police and Fire departments.\n\nFollowing Baker\u2019s announcement, the Lynn Public Schools will be closed until at least April 6.

Grocery stores and pharmacies won\u2019t be impacted.\n\nIn addition, the CDC recommends that organizations that serve people who are at higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness, such as older adults and those with chronic conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes or lung disease, cancel events for groups of 10 people or more, according to the mayor.\n\n\u201cAs we work to mitigate this current public health emergency, we thank you in advance for your patience and understanding during this time,\u201d said McGee. \u201cThe city will continue to discuss its approaches to meeting the needs of the public while keeping the health of everyone in mind.\u201d\n\nResidents are encouraged to take the following precautions to prevent a community spread of the coronavirus:\n\nWash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.\n\nCover your coughs and sneezes with your elbow or a tissue and dispose of any used material.

What causes a recession and what are the signs? USA TODAY\n\nMUNCIE, Ind. \u2014 Officials from Delaware County and the City of Muncie enacted a joint disaster emergency declaration Thursday, which will increase closures countywide due to the novel coronavirus and the authority local officials can use to enforce them.\n\nAccording to a release from officials, the declaration was made in unison between the City of Muncie and Delaware County at the recommendation of the Delaware County Health Department.\n\n\"After declarations of a nationwide emergency, and the state of Indiana making an emergency declaration regarding COVID-19, the county health officer has determined that various measures need enacted to lessen the spread of COVID-19,\" the release reads.\n\nCity, county officials ordered these businesses to shut down\n\nThe declaration invokes Indiana state codes, which gives emergency authority to officials. All citizens are required to comply with necessary emergency measures, to cooperate with public officials and disaster services in executing emergency operation plans.\n\nBased on the recommendation of the health department, all barbershops, hair salons, nail salons, tattoo parlors, gyms, recreational sports facilities or indoor play areas, private clubs and fraternal organizations will be closed to the public.\n\nIn addition, all county and city offices are now officially closed to the public. They can only be accessed by appointment only, with special rules for courts, as explained in the document.\n\nCoronavirus shutdown: Closings, cancellations and changes in Muncie and East Central Indiana\n\nCoronavirus in Indiana: Here's what we know and the latest COVID-19 updates\n\nAs for the courts, those that have actual hearings or summons will be allowed to enter either the Delaware County Justice Center or City Hall.\n\nEmployees, residents must stay home if they show coronavirus symptoms\n\nThe declaration also enacts certain measures for employees and citizens to use caution, and to stay home if they exhibit symptoms of COVID-19. Employees should not return until they have been fever-free for more than 24 hours, only if they are not diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nClosures: How area fitness centers are responding to coronavirus concerns\n\nSchool closures: All Indiana schools will remain closed until May 1, state testing canceled\n\n\u201cWhile these decisions were not easy to make by either party, the goal of this declaration is to protect the health and lives of the citizens in Delaware County and Muncie,\u201d the release reads. \u201cNow is the time to act, not out of fear, but out of compassion, to prevent the spread of this terrible illness.\u201d\n\nState and local officials are doing what they can to help, mayor says\n\nMuncie Mayor Dan Ridenour said that all of the industries that are being closed require workers to get within a 6 foot area of a customer as part of the job. That puts people at risk.\n\n\u201cThe public should take some comfort that the state and local officials are doing what is reasonable and helpful in helping slow down the spread of this virus,\u201d Ridenour said.\n\nAll of our coronavirus stories are free.

Ridenour said that Delaware County was holding together better than others in the state in limiting the outbreak and that enacting these procedures would help with that. Other counties and cities across the state have taken similar measures in the last 48 hours.\n\nMayor's response: Ridenour: Muncie will do everything it can to help community cope with pandemic\n\nIf there will be further escalation beyond the declaration, only time will tell. The order stipulates that officials may implement stricter requirements in the future such as reducing work schedules, work-at-home rules and closing of non-emergency operations.\n\nRidenour said that discussions were ongoing every day with federal, state and local officials.\n\nCorey Ohlenkamp is the city\/county government reporter.

Gavin Newsom issued an executive order banning the eviction for renters affected by COVID-19 through May 31.\n\nNewsom said his order prohibits landlords from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent and prohibits enforcement of evictions by law enforcement or courts.\n\nNewsom said his action builds on a previous order he issued authorizing local governments to half evictions for renters impacted by the pandemic.\n\nCity Councilwoman Nikki Fortunato Bas, one of the sponsors of Oakland\u2019s ordinance, said at Friday\u2019s meeting that she welcomes Newsom\u2019s order but added, \u201cIt\u2019s still important to vote (on the ordinance) today because it addresses our specific needs in Oakland.\u201d\n\nCity Council President Rebecca Kaplan said the eviction moratorium is important because, \u201cI\u2019ve talked to many people who are scared because they\u2019ve been laid off and are in limbo.\u201d\n\nKaplan continued: \u201cThey\u2019re at great risk of losing the roofs over their heads because they can\u2019t pay the rent.

The public should not have cause for panic but cause for reassurance,\u201d Reiskin said.\n\nIn a related matter concerning fears about the possible spreading of the virus at large public gatherings, many speakers at the meeting expressed concern about the large crowds of tenants, landlords, attorneys and court staff at eviction hearings at the Hayward Hall of Justice, where all such hearings in Alameda County are held.\n\nMeghan Gordon, director and clinical supervisor of the housing practice at the East Bay Community Law Center, said crowds of 100 to 200 people often gather in close proximity in and outside the courtroom of Superior Court Judge Patrick McKinney, who holds the eviction hearings.\n\nGordon said the situation presents a public safety issue for all involved. But she said the problem exists because tenants and landlords need to appear in court to try to protect their rights.\n\nResponding to the concerns that were expressed at the meeting, the City Council unanimously passed an emergency measure asking Alameda County Superior Court Presiding Judge Tara Desautels to delay all eviction hearings until April 7 for public safety reasons.\n\nOakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a letter to the City Council that in order to try to prevent the virus from spreading to homeless people, the city in partnership with Alameda County is nearly doubling the number of encampment sites, from 20 to 39, at which it will provide toilets, sanitizer and hand-washing stations.\n\nSchaaf said the city also is providing additional hand sanitizers at the 20 encampments that already are serviced with toilets and hygiene.\n\nIn her letter, Schaaf wrote, \u201cAt present, we have no confirmed cases of COVID-19 among our unsheltered population.

The length of such declarations can vary, and in last week's case it was deemed necessary to last seven days. Now that those seven days have expired, village staff told Patch that the declaration is being renewed.\n\nWhile saying that there are \"no new circumstances\" in Plainfield's current situation, village Community Relations Director Amy De Boni added that, \"the disaster declaration will continue to be renewed throughout the ongoing COVID-19 situation.\"\n\n\n\nThis means that until such time as it is deemed no longer necessary, the emergency declaration will continue to be renewed every Monday.\n\nDeclarations of a State of Emergency allow municipalities like Plainfield to receive disaster-relief funds from FEMA should that become necessary, and to change certain protocols regarding how the village government operates. In this case, declaring an emergency allows the village to activate its emergency operations plan. According to Village Administrator Brian Murphy, this plan has multiple tiers related to the spread of coronavirus, with different actions to be taken as more cases of the virus appear in proximity to Plainfield. As of Monday afternoon, a total of 26 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Will County and four cases had been confirmed in Kendall County.\n\n\"As this virus finds its way through the Chicagoland area... we have differing levels of action plans,\" Murphy said last Monday. \"They run from it being just a federal and state issue - we know it's that already. As of this afternoon it has moved into being a regional issue... The next two levels are when there cases that make it into Plainfield and then finally... if we have cases within the [village government] itself.\"\n\n\n\nAt present, the most drastic step the village has taken in its plans is to close all municipal facilities to the public. This step complements the 'stay at home' executive order handed down by Governor J.B. Pritzker on Saturday, asking all Illinoisans to stay home except for essential tasks. Murphy also said the next Plainfield village board meeting will likely make use of digital and teleconference technology, to limit the amount of time board trustees and meeting attendees spend together physically.\n\n\"It will be live, it may be streaming only on cable,\" Murphy said. \"It may be that we just have a conference call right here in [Village Hall] and people can listen in.\"\n\nTo learn more about Mayor Collins' emergency declaration, visit the Plainfield village website or call the mayor's office at (815) 436-7093.\n\nTo keep on top of the latest coronavirus news, subscribe to Patch news alerts and newsletters.

The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.\n\nThe villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.\n\nMore than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.\n\nHealth before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.\n\nMnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.\n\nBut he says President Donald Trump\u2019s top objective is the health of the American public.\n\nMnuchin tells \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.\n\nHe said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.\n\nHe said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.\n\nLouisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state\u2019s health care system.\n\nEdwards said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.\n\nHe said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.\n\nHe made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.\n\nMuscovites told to stay home\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.\n\nA video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch\u2019s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.\n\nNon-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.\n\n14-year-old boy dies in Portugal\n\nLISBON, Portugal \u2014 The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.\n\nMinister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.\n\nPortugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.\n\nPelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress says the government should be \u201ctaking every precaution\u201d and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.\n\nSpeaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s \u201cdenial\u201d early in the crisis was \u201cdeadly.\u201d\n\nShe says: \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.\u201d\n\nPelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: \u201cWhat did he know and when did he know it?\u201d\n\nPanama to allow cruise ships to use canal\n\nPANAMA CITY \u2014 Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\nHolland America Line said via a Facebook post, \u201cWe greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew\u201d and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.\n\nThe Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.\n\nHolland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nPanamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.\n\n50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.\n\nMany of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It\u2019s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.\n\nAnother 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":8602.0,"lat":38.3552,"lng":-87.5784}

It's just not worth the risk,\" said Tracy Dell'Angela Barber, executive director, in an email to supporters.\n\nRiver Forest Public Library not canceling events, monitoring situation\n\nFrancisca Arnold, marketing and public relations specialist of the River Forest Public Library, said on March 11 that the library is currently not canceling any events but is constantly monitoring the situation.\n\n\"We are taking all the recommended precautions, such as wiping down surfaces, having hand sanitizer available, and have signage up about hand washing, etc.,\" said Arnold in an email. \"We are also planning on putting more space between the chairs starting with this Sunday's event.\" She added that any cancelations will be listed on the website immediately, and anyone who has signed up for events will get an email alerting them of changes or cancelations.\n\nMaria Maxham\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Oak Park Village Board will vote Friday morning in a special meeting to expand the powers of its public health department director to respond to worries about the growing coronavirus threat.\n\nUnder the plan, Mike Charley, the longtime health department director, will have expanded authority, ranging from decisions on closing facilities, limiting the size of public gatherings to more mundane virus-mitigation actions, such as ordering supplies or equipment that would typically require village board approval.\n\n\"These are extraordinary times. We want to cut the red tape and empower our staff to make decisions,\" said Mayor Anan Abu-Taleb on Wednesday afternoon. \"We want to assure the public that we will always be forthcoming with any information we have and that we are taking this seriously.\"\n\nAbu-Taleb said that as of March 11, there were no known cases of infection in Oak Park.\n\n\"We are taking proactive actions,\" he said.\n\nCara Pavlicek, Oak Park village manager, said Tuesday that village government has been making internal policy changes since last week. Those range, she said, from following CDC protocol for cleaning voting machines in use during early voting at village hall, 123 Madison St., to placing quarantine restrictions on any employee who might be returning from a Level 3 country or any employee who might be returning from a cruise.\n\nAdditionally, village hall has suspended any employee travel through April 1. Village hall has also guaranteed that no employee will lose wages if they become sick with the virus and run out of sick leave.\n\nOak Park, said Abu-Taleb, is one of five municipalities in Cook County with its own public health department.\n\n\"This is a procedural step to allow Mike [Charley] to make decisions as he sees fit,\" said Abu-Taleb.\n\nPavlicek said the village board has the authority to rescind decisions it might disagree with.\n\nAbu-Taleb said the village is in frequent communication with all local taxing bodies and will confer on all major decisions. But, he said, \"public safety issues tilt toward village hall.\"\n\nThe expansion of health department authority had been expected to be approved at a village board meeting on Monday, March 16. The decision was made Wednesday to move more quickly and set a special meeting for Friday.\n\nDan Haley","category":"None","population":22.0,"lat":40.1107,"lng":-85.7294}

Murray said. \"We are monitoring the situation closely and conferring with these experts as the ongoing situation warrants.\n\n\"With that in mind and out of an abundance of caution, I am declaring a state of emergency in the Village of Rockville Centre effective immediately,\" Murray continued. \"This declaration will allow the Village to more efficiently respond to the situation and potentially be reimbursed for costs associated with the pandemic.\"\n\nThe village is shutting down all non-essential services for two weeks. All essential services, including the sanitation, electric, water, sewage, and police department.

Anderson Recreation Center, said that those who have signed up for classes during this time frame will be notified via email with information about possible make-up classes or reimbursement for missed classes. Staff members will be available to answer any questions at 516-678-9238 on Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the closure.\n\nMurray stressed that closing of the facilities is an effort to minimize the effects of the virus on the community.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure we make the safest decisions possible to protect our residents and employees,\u201d Murray said, \u201cwhile maintaining service to our community.\n\n\u201cWe will reevaluate the rapidly evolving situation at the end of the two weeks,\u201d Murray added. \u201cI am confident that as a community, we will weather these challenging times together.\n\nThe Rockville Centre Public Library is closed through March 29, and is expected to reopen on March 30. No fines will be charged during this time.\n\n\u201cAs a precautionary measure, we are suspending all library programming, events and meetings for all ages,\u201d director Catherine Overton said, noting that staff will heighten its cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces and advising patrons to also take steps to protect others.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":4199.0,"lat":39.7665,"lng":-87.2295}

Of those, Hennepin and Ramsey counties account for 32 of the cases.\n\nBy declaring local states of emergencies, the cities\u2019 emergency management departments can request funding from and coordinate with other layers of government, including the counties, state and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\n\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Frey issued a statement that said with the emergency declaration he will force bars, restaurants, nightclubs and coffee shops to close or limit their hours beginning Tuesday at noon. \u201cOperations will be limited to delivery, takeout, and drive thru orders,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNo further details on how, exactly, the city will monitor for compliance and enforce the new guidelines were immediately available.\n\nFrey also said he\u2019s coming up with a budget plan for stocking up on protective gear, such as masks and face masks, for city employees who are at risk of catching COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur team will remain in constant communication with leadership in city hall and partners throughout Minnesota while we work to promote mitigation strategies, deliver core city services, and deploy resources where they are needed most,\u201d Frey\u2019s statement read.\n\nSt. Paul closes libraries, parks\n\nAbout 19 hours before Frey\u2019s announcement, on Sunday, Carter declared a state of emergency and announced the closure of St. Paul public libraries, parks and recreation facilities \u2014 including the Como Park Zoo and Conservatory \u2014 until Friday, March 27.\n\nSt. Paul\u2019s firefighters and medics are in charge of helping people who show signs of COVID-19 \u2014 a fever, cough and shortness of breath \u2014 and need help getting to the hospital, according to the city. The city is preparing to provide compensation for emergency responders who contract the virus on duty and need to stay home to get better.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for Mayor Carter\u2019s leadership during this challenging and historic moment in our history,\u201d said St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell in a statement. \u201cI am even more grateful and proud of our officers and first responders who simply don\u2019t have the option of staying home during moments of crisis.\u201d\n\nSt. Paul city staff are developing plans to keep essential services (water, public safety, etc.) in operation, help families during the statewide school closures beginning Wednesday and care for animals at the zoo when it\u2019s not open to the public.\n\n\n\nMuch of Minneapolis and St. Paul\u2019s emergency declarations have the same guidelines. For instance, both cities said, until further notice, they are no longer issuing new permits for gatherings of 50 or more people in accordance with public health officials\u2019 guidelines for containing the virus.\n\nAdditionally, the mayors have suspended water shut-offs so residents can continue washing hands regularly, and they have asked their sheriff\u2019s departments to stop issuing housing evictions until the outbreak subsides. That\u2019s only a request \u2014 the respective sheriffs departments hold the discretion on whether or not to pause issuing evictions of residents.\n\nThose moves, the mayors said, would help protect the cities\u2019 most vulnerable residents.\n\n\u201cThe impacts of COVID-19 stand to cause sudden and sharp drops in income for many tenants in our community,\u201d Carter wrote in a letter to Ramsey County Sheriff Bob Fletcher.\n\nProtections for workers\n\nTo protect staff and customers from the virus, many employers in Minneapolis and St. Paul have already closed their doors or come up with new ways to do business.\n\nIn Minneapolis, where all employers must offer paid sick leave to employees under a city ordinance, the closures have spurred confusion among workers over what pay they\u2019re guaranteed, according to Brian Walsh, enforcement supervisor of the city\u2019s labor standards division.\n\nUnder the city\u2019s sick and safe time law, people who need to take off work to take care of their children because of the upcoming school closures can use accrued sick and safe time hours, according to Walsh.\n\nSimilarly, the city\u2019s ordinance covers employees affected by Frey\u2019s decision to close bars, restaurants, clubs and coffee shops, Walsh said.\n\n\n\nBut the rule does not cover workers unaffected by the emergency declaration, even if their managers told them not to come to work or shut down the business. In those cases, Walsh recommends people check out the state\u2019s guidelines regarding unemployment insurance.\n\nUnless those people seem sick: People who display symptoms of the virus may use any accrued sick and safe time hours to rest up, Walsh said. Also, the city\u2019s ordinance protects workers who have \u201creason to believe they are probably infected\u201d and feel they need to self-quarantine.\n\n\u2018An extraordinary time\u2019\n\nIn a statement Monday, Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender said she supports Frey\u2019s decision to enact a state of emergency to prevent the spread of the novel virus.\n\nShe said the council will hold a special meeting on Thursday to vote on Frey\u2019s declaration, which would solidify the city\u2019s emergency status and allow for it to continue for as long as the state\u2019s peacetime state of emergency lasts. Gov. Tim Walz issued that decision on Friday.\n\nEven without the council\u2019s approval, Frey\u2019s emergency declaration remains in effect for three days.\n\nAs the situation evolves, Bender said city staff will brief the council regularly on the outbreak and how the latest developments could change what it\u2019s like to live and work in Minneapolis.\n\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary time,\u201d she said, emphasizing the need for collaboration across city departments, businesses and neighborhoods. \u201cI am working with my colleagues and Mayor Frey to center our commitments to race and economic equity in our response COVID-19.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement by Frey is a departure from his less-dramatic message on Friday, when he spoke publicly about the city\u2019s response to COVID-19 for the first time.\n\nTo reporters and viewers of a Facebook Live video, he said the city\u2019s core services would continue without interruption. But should non-essential employees have to work remotely or find other ways to do their jobs, he said departments were shoring up protections against cyber attacks and developing staffing contingency plans for first responders and 911 dispatchers.\n\n\u201cThere is temptation to flip a switch, completely shut down, just ride it out for the next 30 to 60 days,\u201d the mayor said Friday. \u201cBut public health research and quality emergency operations and planning tells us that it\u2019s best not to take dramatic action without being based on solid rationale; it is better to gradually move up and eventually down a sliding scale or spectrum of actions.\u201d","category":"state_of_emergency","population":1061.0,"lat":39.4279,"lng":-85.6286}

The concerns are not just about health-care workers getting sick but also about them potentially carrying the virus to other patients in the hospital.\n\nR. Alta Charo, a University of Wisconsin-Madison bioethicist, said that while the idea of withholding treatments may be unsettling, especially in a country as wealthy as ours, it is pragmatic. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t help anybody if our doctors and nurses are felled by this virus and not able to care for us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe code process is one that puts them at an enhanced risk.\u201d\n\nWunderink said all of the most critically ill patients in the 12 days since they had their first coronavirus case have experienced steady declines rather than a sudden crash. That allowed medical staff to talk with families about the risk to workers and how having to put on protective gear delays a response and decreases the chance of saving someone\u2019s life.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA consequence of those conversations, he said, is that many family members are making the difficult choice to sign do-not-resuscitate orders.\n\nCode blue\n\nHealth-care providers are bound by oath \u2014 and in some states, by law \u2014 to do everything they can within the bounds of modern technology to save a patient\u2019s life, absent an order, such as a DNR, to do otherwise. But as cases mount amid a national shortage of personal protective equipment, or PPE, hospitals are beginning to implement emergency measures that will either minimize, modify or completely stop the use of certain procedures on patients with covid-19.\n\nSome of the most anxiety-provoking minutes in a health-care worker\u2019s day involve participating in procedures that send virus-laced droplets from a patient\u2019s airways all over the room.\n\nAD\n\nThese include endoscopies, bronchoscopies and other procedures in which tubes or cameras are sent down the throat and are routine in ICUs to look for bleeds or examine the inside of the lungs.\n\nAD\n\nChanging or eliminating those protocols is likely to decrease some patients\u2019 chances for survival. But hospital administrators and doctors say the measures are necessary to save the most lives.\n\nThe most extreme of these situations is when a patient, in hospital lingo, \u201ccodes.\u201d\n\nWhen a code blue alarm is activated, it signals that a patient has gone into cardiopulmonary arrest and typically all available personnel \u2014 usually somewhere around eight but sometimes as many as 30 people \u2014 rush into the room to begin live-saving procedures without which the person would almost certainly perish.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely dangerous in terms of infection risk because it involves multiple bodily fluids,\u201d explained one ICU physician in the Midwest, who did not want her name used because she was not authorized to speak by her hospital.\n\nAD\n\nFred Wyese, an ICU nurse in Muskegon, Mich., describes it like a storm:\n\nA team of nurses and doctors, trading off every two minutes, begin the chest compressions that are part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation or CPR. Someone punctures the neck and arms to access blood vessels to put in new intravenous lines. Someone else grabs a \u201ccrash cart\u201d stocked with a variety of lifesaving medications and equipment ranging from epinephrine injectors to a defibrillator to restart the heart.\n\nAD\n\nAs soon as possible, a breathing tube will be placed down the throat and the person will be hooked up to a mechanical ventilator. Even in the best of times, a patient who is coding presents an ethical maze; there\u2019s often no clear cut answer for when there\u2019s still hope and when it\u2019s too late.\n\nIn the process, heaps of protective equipment is used \u2014 often many dozens of gloves, gowns, masks, and more.\n\nAD\n\nBruno Petinaux, chief medical officer at George Washington University Hospital, said the hospital has had a lot of discussion about how \u2014 and whether \u2014 to resuscitate covid-19 patients who are coding.\n\n\u201cFrom a safety perspective you can make the argument that the safest thing is to do nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that is necessarily the right approach. So we have decided not to go in that direction. What we are doing is what can be done safely.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHowever, he said, the decision comes down to a hospital\u2019s resources and \u201cevery hospital has to assess and evaluate for themselves.\u201d It\u2019s still early in the outbreak in the Washington area, and GW still has sufficient equipment and manpower. Petinaux said he cannot rule out a change in protocol if things get worse.\n\nGW\u2019s procedure for responding to coronavirus patients who are coding includes using a machine called a Lucas device, which looks like a bumper, to deliver chest compressions. But the hospital has only two. If the Lucas devices are not readily accessible, doctors and nurses have been told to drape plastic sheeting \u2014 the 7-mil kind available at Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s \u2014 over the patient\u2019s body to minimize the spread of droplets and then proceed with chest compressions. Because the patient would presumably be on a ventilator, there is no risk of suffocation.\n\nAD\n\nIn Washington state which had the nation\u2019s first covid-19 cases, UW Medicine\u2019s chief medical officer, Tim Dellit, said the decision to send in fewer doctors and nurses to help a coding patient is about \u201cminimizing use of PPE as we go into the surge.\u201d He said the hospital is monitoring health-care workers\u2019 health closely. So far, the percentage of infections among those tested is less than in the general population, which, he hopes, means their precautions are working.\n\n'It is a nightmare\u2019\n\nBioethicist Scott Halpern at the University of Pennsylvania is the author of one widely circulated model guideline being considered by many hospitals. In an interview, he said a blanket stop to resuscitations for infected patients is too \u201cdraconian\u201d and may end up sacrificing a young person who is otherwise in good health. However, health-care workers and limited protective equipment cannot be ignored.\n\n\u201cIf we risk their well-being in service of one patient, we detract from the care of future patients, which is unfair,\u201d he said.\n\nHalpern\u2019s document calls for two physicians, the one directly taking care of a patient and one who is not, to sign off on do-not-resuscitate orders. They must document the reason for the decision, and the family must be informed but does not have to agree.\n\nWyese, the Michigan ICU nurse, said his own hospital has been thinking about these issues for years but still is unprepared.\n\n\u201cThey made us do all kinds of mandatory education and fittings and made it sound like they are prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when it hits the fan, they don\u2019t have the supplies so the plans they had in place aren\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Wyese said, a suspected covid-19 patient was rushed in and put into a negative pressure room to prevent the virus spread. In normal times, a nurse in full hazmat-type gear would sit with the patient to care for him, but there was little equipment to spare. So Wyese had to monitor him from the outside. Before he walked inside, he said, he would have to put on a face shield, N95 mask, and other equipment and slather antibacterial foam on his bald head as the hospital did not have any more head coverings. Only one powered air-purifying respirator or PAPR was available for the room and others nearby that could be used when performing an invasive procedure \u2014 but it was 150 feet away.\n\nWhile he said his hospital\u2019s policy still called for a full response to patients whose heart or breathing stopped, he worried any efforts would be challenging, if not futile.\n\n\u201cBy the time you get all gowned up and double-gloved the patient is going to be dead,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to be coding dead people. It is a nightmare.\u201d","category":"None","population":344.0,"lat":39.6226,"lng":-87.4554}

The declaration will also help nursing homes and daycare providers obtain protective supplies.\n\nBass said the supply of personal protective equipment during the COVID-19 virus outbreak has become \"dangerously low\" in the county as the need continues to increase. He urged any business or company which may have access to supplies of personal protective equipment to contact Warren County Health Services.\n\nThe disaster declaration will also open up state assistance avenues for low income individuals and small businesses.\n\nThe closure of Warren County buildings and offices to the general public has also been extended indefinitely. DeKock said the county will look to lift the closure of the buildings at the time Warren County's school districts reopen, which is currently set for April 13 but may change in the future.\n\nAll Warren County buildings, including the administration building, will remain closed to the general public, but county workers will still be available by telephone, email and appointment.\n\nWarren County public health director Jodene DeVault said the closures are needed to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n\"We still should be doing some very significant social distancing,\" DeVault said.\n\nThe first positive case of COVID-19 in Warren County was reported Tuesday. A member of the Norwalk schools district central office tested positive for the virus which causes COVID-19. DeVault said there are likely more cases in the county but determining a more exact number is difficult because of a shortage of supplies and a five to six day wait for results.\n\nThis article is available free as a service to our community during the coronavirus outbreak.

Days before, groups including the Maryland Prisoners\u2019 Rights Coalition wrote to Gov. Larry Hogan (R) urging him to expedite the release of prisoners whose sentences will soon expire, as well as those serving short sentences.\n\nOn Monday, the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia plans to send a similar letter to Gov. Ralph Northam (D) demanding he reduce prisoner intake, free those whose sentences are due to end next year and release \u201cvulnerable people\u201d \u2014 meaning the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. As of Sunday afternoon, no virus cases had been reported in Maryland or Virginia jails.\n\n\u201c Carceral facilities make social distancing impossible and are not built or prepared to fulfill the medical needs associated with covid-19,\u201d the illness caused by the virus, Virginia ACLU executive director Claire G. Gasta\u00f1aga wrote in the letter, a copy of which was provided to The Washington Post.\n\nIt is a problem facing jails nationwide, as the virus continues its steady march of infection across the country. Health officials have warned that cells \u2014 which house so many people, so close together \u2014 essentially function as perfect incubators for the virus. Over the past two weeks, with detention facilities throughout the country beginning to report their first cases, some state and local officials have responded by freeing inmates early and encouraging fewer arrests.\n\nThe Public Defender Service has been concerned for a while that conditions at the D.C. jail would foster the spread of the virus, the service\u2019s special counsel Janet Mitchell said Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe see cautionary tales from other jurisdictions and want to avoid being the next Rikers,\u201d Mitchell said, referring to the New York jail where dozens have tested positive. \u201cWe are asking all the stakeholders to take action now and to start releasing as many persons as possible as quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nMitchell suggested setting free \u201cat minimum\u201d those who are serving misdemeanor sentences, or awaiting trial on misdemeanors. She also urged judges who previously denied bond review motions \u2014 citing the then-absence of coronavirus cases within D.C. jails \u2014 to reverse their decisions.\n\nAuthorities announced the diagnosis of the first reported case in the District\u2019s jail system, a 20-year-old, on Wednesday. Two days later, authorities said that a 44-year-old man housed in the Correctional Treatment Facility \u2014 the same facility that held the 20-year-old, although the two inmates were not in the same unit \u2014 had also tested positive.\n\nLate Saturday, jail officials announced the diagnosis of two more inmates, a 37-year-old and a 38-year-old both housed in the same treatment facility as the first two patients. The 37-year-old and 38-year-old are being treated and have been isolated from other inmates, according to Department of Corrections spokeswoman Keena Black.\n\nIn the letter to Northam \u2014 which also included a draft of an executive order he could sign, fulfilling activists\u2019 requests \u2014 Gasta\u00f1aga noted that the spread of the virus in the state\u2019s jail system would disproportionately affect people of color, who are overrepresented in America\u2019s prisons. Black people make up 19 percent of Virginia\u2019s overall population, she wrote, but 58 percent of the state\u2019s incarcerated population.\n\nMaking matters worse, Gasta\u00f1aga wrote, people of color are also more likely to suffer from diabetes, heart disease and respiratory disease, all conditions that health officials believe increase an individual\u2019s risk of contracting and dying from coronavirus.\n\nIf the virus finds its way into the state\u2019s jail system, she warned, the consequences will be horrifying.\n\n\u201cThe time for action is now,\u201d Gasta\u00f1aga wrote. \u201cThis pandemic is here, and it will \u2014 if it hasn\u2019t already \u2014 make its way into our custodial facilities.\u201d\n\nOvetta Wiggins and Laura Vozzella contributed to this report.","category":"disaster_declaration","population":13117.0,"lat":38.6592,"lng":-87.1721}

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nThis collection of files from the Associated Press was posted by Black Press Media at 9 a.m., Sunday, March 29.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\nConnecticut and Oregon added to list of states under disaster declaration\n\n2 Sri Lankan villages sealed off after positive coronavirus tests\n\nMnuchin says decision to reopen business will be health decision not economic\n\nFauci warns U.S. will have \u201cmillions of cases\u201d of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths\n\nMore than 100,000 deaths predicted for the U.S.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The U.S. government\u2019s foremost infection disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, says the U.S. will certainly have \u201cmillions of cases\u201d of COVID-19 and more than 100,000 deaths.\n\nAs the U.S. tops the world in reported infections from the new coronavirus, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases predicts 100,000-200,000 deaths from the outbreak in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. is currently reporting more than 124,000 cases and more than 2,100 deaths.\n\nFauci was speaking to CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d as the federal government is discussing rolling back guidelines on social distancing in areas that have not been hard-hit by the outbreak.\n\nFauci says he would only support the rollback in lesser-impacted areas if there is enhanced availability of testing in place to monitor those areas. He acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s a little iffy there\u201d right now.\n\nWith Oregon and Connecticut, states with disasters declared extends to 18\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has added Connecticut and Oregon to the list of states where a disaster has been declared due to the coronavirus. A disaster declaration makes a state eligible for federal assistance to supplement state and local efforts to respond to the pandemic.\n\nThe White House said Sunday that Trump had approved the two new disaster declarations.\n\nThe addition of Connecticut and Oregon brings the list of states where a disaster has been declared to 18, along with Guam and Puerto Rico.\n\nSri Lanka seals off two villages\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka \u2014 Sri Lankan authorities have sealed off two villages as a part of stringent measures designed to contain the spreading of the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases in the Indian ocean island nation has now risen to 115 with one fatality.\n\nThe villages of Atalugama and Akurana were sealed off after several COVID-19 patients were reported from those areas.\n\nMore than 6,00 people have been arrested and 1,533 vehicles seized for violating curfew.\n\nHealth before economics, U.S. Treasury Secretary says\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says a decision whether to reopen the nation back for business as early as Easter will be a health decision not an economic one.\n\nMnunchin acknowledges surging unemployment numbers and declining GDP as 1 in 3 Americans remain under government orders to stay at home to slow the coronavirus that has killed over 2,000 Americans.\n\nBut he says President Donald Trump\u2019s top objective is the health of the American public.\n\nMnuchin tells \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that his own top focus is getting stimulus money from the just-passed $2.2 trillion aid package from Congress immediately into the hands of workers and businesses.\n\nHe said American workers will get direct deposits of money in three weeks, while a federal program aimed at helping half the workforce by encouraging small business to take out loans to hire back their workers for eight weeks will be up and running by Friday.\n\nHe said the stimulus package should help keep the economy and workers afloat for 10 weeks, and if more time is needed to stem the coronavirus, the administration will assess what else is needed at that time.\n\nLouisiana warns health system can be overwhelmed\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana warns the quick spread of the coronavirus could soon overwhelm the state\u2019s health care system.\n\nEdwards said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that Louisiana is on a trajectory to overwhelm its health care system and will need more ventilators by the end of the first week of April. He says the state will be out of hospital beds several days into April.\n\nHe said they have orders out for more than 12,000 ventilators through the national stockpile and private vendors, but Louisiana so far has only been able to get 192.\n\nHe made a plea to the people of Louisiana to shelter at home in an effort to slow the spread in the state, which per capita has the third highest number of cases and second highest number of deaths in the country.\n\nMuscovites told to stay home\n\nMOSCOW \u2014 The Russian capital has deployed trucks equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast a message discouraging Muscovites from using parks and asking them to stay at home.\n\nA video posted by a journalist for the Interfax news agency showed a truck parked Sunday at an entrance to Patriarch\u2019s Ponds, blaring the message as a handful of people strolled through the popular park.\n\nNon-essential businesses in Moscow were closed beginning Saturday. About two-thirds of the 1534 coronavirus infection cases reported in Russia occurred in Moscow.\n\n14-year-old boy dies in Portugal\n\nLISBON, Portugal \u2014 The Portuguese health minister says a 14-year-old boy with COVID-19 has died. Authorities said the boy had prior health conditions.\n\nMinister Marta Temido said the boy tested positive for the coronavirus but health expert still need to investigate if he died of the disease caused by the virus or other health problems.\n\nPortugal reported Sunday it has 119 total deaths from the virus and 38,042 infections.\n\nPelosi says delay in crisis will be deadly\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says President Donald Trump shouldn\u2019t be rushing to reopen schools and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress says the government should be \u201ctaking every precaution\u201d and that there needs to be more testing for the virus in place to determine if areas currently showing fewer infections are truly at lower risk.\n\nSpeaking to CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Pelosi said Trump\u2019s \u201cdenial\u201d early in the crisis was \u201cdeadly.\u201d\n\nShe says: \u201cAs the president fiddles, people are dying, and we have to take every precaution.\u201d\n\nPelosi says Congress will have to investigate whether Trump heeded advice from scientific experts as part of an after-action report on the pandemic response. She asks: \u201cWhat did he know and when did he know it?\u201d\n\nPanama to allow cruise ships to use canal\n\nPANAMA CITY \u2014 Panama will allow two Holland America cruise ships to pass through the canal on their way to Florida even though one of the ships has confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe Health Ministry says it will allow the passage because of the health risks to passengers aboard the Zaandam. No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\nHolland America Line said via a Facebook post, \u201cWe greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew\u201d and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.\n\nThe Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.\n\nHolland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nPanamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.\n\n50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.\n\nMany of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It\u2019s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.\n\nAnother 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":438.0,"lat":38.8147,"lng":-86.6446}

At this stage of the pandemic it is our hope that it is more accurate to say that we are in a state of preventing an emergency.\n\nIt is important to be reminded that the most important things to do in any emergency are to remain calm, not panic, understand the facts, stay informed, proceed with caution and take the advice of those most knowledgeable.\n\nIt is clear that the Oregon Health Authority, working with Oregon cities and counties, is providing that leadership with facts and updates that you can access directly at the City of Woodburn's web page: www.woodburn-or.gov\/health.\n\nThere you will learn that the novel coronavirus and influenza have similar symptoms that include high fever, cough and difficulty breathing. Influenza, still circulating in Oregon, is a much more likely cause of fever and cough than coronavirus, but it is important to contact your health provider by phone if you have any concerns or questions. In addition you can dial 211 (and not 911) if you have questions or would like more information about the coronavirus.\n\nThe city has taken the precautions of closing our library and aquatic center through April 1 and asking people to pay their water bills online, by phone or in the drop box outside City Hall. Please access the City's web and facebook pages for updates about all city services.\n\nIn moments of heightened concern like this, when we are likely more worried about our health and the health of our loved ones, and the world around us seems cattywampus like my father used to say, we can also take this moment to slow down and appreciate those around us more.\n\nWith the cancellation of nearly all activities, at the precise moment when we have less we have to do, there is less to do. As we spend more time at home without rushing off to the activity that's now canceled, maybe we'll eventually become bored with whatever is on our screens and turn our attention to those we live with. And maybe we'll even take a walk around the neighborhood and wave at our neighbors that we never see and talk with them - from six feet away.\n\nWhile the likelihood of contracting the coronavirus is still very small, and the likelihood of surviving it if contracted is still very high, there is cause for concern. As we take those precautions seriously let us not be overtaken by fear. Too often fear replaces calm and then clouds our judgment and we are prone to rumors, scams and divisive conspiracy theories. When that happens, we should hear Franklin Roosevelt's words on the subject and answer that fear with reason.\n\nSpeaking of reason, as your mayor I have preached the need for all of us to be prepared in the case of a natural disaster, like an earthquake, by stocking up on key items - and this is an appropriate time for that. Having said that, please leave some toilet paper on the shelves for your neighbors.\n\nLike every virus, this one will run its course. Our country and our community have weathered many health related crisis throughout our history, and by remaining calm, staying informed and taking precautions we will weather this one as well.","category":"None","population":1603.0,"lat":41.1287,"lng":-84.8503}

No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\nHolland America Line said via a Facebook post, \u201cWe greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew\u201d and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.\n\nThe Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.\n\nHolland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nPanamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.\n\n50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.\n\nMany of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths.

Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.\n\nAnother 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":869.0,"lat":41.7306,"lng":-92.2947}

Sacramento, Placer and Yolo counties have done the same.\n\nEl Dorado County officials said Thursday\u2019s declaration allows them to provide or receive mutual aid from other jurisdictions and helps in open up resources, mutual aid and staffing.\n\nThe county continues to work closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and California Department of Public Health on coordinated testing, investigations and guidance and help to health care providers. The joint efforts also include monitoring for acute respiratory illness and gathering information to detect new cases for lab testing and confirming infection.\n\nEl Dorado public health officials were encouraging local facilities, such as long-term care and nursing facilities that have elderly and frail residents, to create procedures that include limiting and screening visitors, and daily monitoring. They also have been encouraged to consulting with public health officials.\n\nFollowing guidance from state officials, El Dorado\u2019s Public Health agency was not recommending that local school districts close campuses Thursday, except for postponing or canceling non-essential large gatherings. Officials said the county also was considering limiting non-essential meetings and gatherings, but any specific details will be announced as they are developed.\n\nWilliams said the risk of transmission for COVID-19 remains low for the public. But she also said it\u2019s important for people to notify their healthcare provider to determine whether testing is needed if they have respiratory symptoms and have traveled to a country with active COVID-19 within the last 14 days or if they have been in close contact with a person to have lab-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nResidents were asked to visit El Dorado County\u2019s coronavirus web page for updated information.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":14692.0,"lat":37.8209,"lng":-96.8614}

This action was presented as a pro-active measure as currently appropriations, or bills in lay mans\u2019 terms, can\u2019t be paid until the council approves them, which requires them to meet in an open meeting.\n\nCity Manager Chris Komarek addressed how the council will meet moving forward. For now, the city will continue to meet in person, and Komarek has been in communication with USD 355 Ellinwood Superintendent Ben Jacobs concerning use of the Ellinwood School and Community Library for a meeting space. This will allow for the social distancing prescribed by Governor Laura Kelly\u2019s executive order concerning group gatherings. Information will be made public in the city\u2019s official newspaper, its website, and posted on the door of the city offices.\n\n\u201cWe will probably wait a few minutes past 7 p.m. to give people who went to the wrong location to get there in time for the meeting,\u201d Komarek said.\n\nCurrently, the city is observing a \u201cWatch situation,\u201d and the council determined it will not move into a \u201cWarning situation\u201d until there is a case of the novel coronavirus confirmed in the county. Some council members argued to delay escalation until the city is notified of a confirmed case in the city. Council member Jacque Isern, however, pointed out there are a number of residents who work in neighboring cities, so the council agreed on the county option.\n\nKomarek presented a number of considerations the Kansas League of Municipalities suggested for cities determining how to respond to the crisis. Discussion centered around how to address public access to city spaces, travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, and how staff will be paid for pandemic related absences during a Watch as well as a Warning situation.\n\nUnder the current Watch, the City of Ellinwood lobby and offices are closed to the public, except for the council chamber during an open meeting. The drive-thru window is available for utility payments, and staff can be reached by phone or electronically. Other city departments are not locked down, and will remain open. Council members agreed because the number of workers in each department fall under the prescribed limit of 10 people in a space, as well as staff using common sense to observe social distancing, this was entirely appropriate.\n\nKomarek attended meetings at the county level and at the City of Great Bend last week, and has been in contact with Hoisington City Manager Jonathan Mitchell. He noted that while those communities have amenities like recreation and activity centers and multiple outdoor spaces to consider, the same is not the case for Ellinwood. He shared actions taken to close access to parks and playgrounds in those communities. Council members came to the conclusion that there would be no benefit to the community at this time to close the playground at Ellinwood City Park, or access to Wolf Pond. They will stay open during the Watch.\n\nThe Municipal court docket for March was delayed until April. It is likely, if the crises continues, that docket will be delayed until May. All new entries are being scheduled for May at this time, according to Ellinwood City Attorney Jane Isern.\n\nShould the city move to a Warning situation, access to the playground will be cut-off, but the park will be open. The walking track at the park, however, falls under the responsibility of the school district, Komarek said.\n\nKomarek asked if the council wanted to discuss the opening of the pool for the 2020 season. Following suit with the City of Hoisington, the council decided to delay discussion until the April 14 meeting. Concerns over the availability of lifeguards that other cities have referred to were determined not to be an issue for Ellinwood. Komarek stated the pool manager and a number of lifeguards have current registration, and some who were up for renewal received training earlier in the month before classes for lifeguard certification were cancelled due to the crisis.\n\n\u201cIf the pool can open, we should be good to go,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee pay\n\nShould employees need to take time off to care for children home from school or daycare due to the COVID-19 shut down, they will be paid through the Family First Response fund for up to 80 hours first. If the situation continues, they can utilize accumulated sick and vacation time next. The Ellinwood City Council approved allowing employees to receive up to five days or 40 hours of negative sick leave if it is required. This, Komarek explained, could occur if an employee needs to take care of a family member, and then later is quarantined for illness and recovery, for instance.\n\nEmployees are covered under the Emergency Relief Act portion of the Family Medical Leave Act, City Attorney Isern said. It allows individuals to be off for 12 weeks without losing their job. The first two weeks of leave would be unpaid, but employees can use up sick or vacation leave during his period. Then, they are eligible to receive 2\/3 of their salary if the reason they are unable to come to work is because they are caring for children because daycare and school are closed during the COVID-19 shutdown. They are not eligible for the benefit if they are home recovering from the virus.\n\n\n\n","category":"None","population":2009.0,"lat":38.3573,"lng":-98.5838}

Laura Kelly imposes statewide stay-at-home order; state logs 6th death, 267 cases","text":"This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. Please support local journalism by subscribing to your local newspaper.\n\nTOPEKA \u2014 Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced Saturday the signing of a temporary statewide stay-at-home directive excluding essential activities and taking effect 12:01 a.m. Monday in response to escalation of coronavirus cases in Kansas.\n\nKelly said the executive order to suspend activities recognized the capacity of COVID-19 infection to escalate and a key role the public could play in restraining it by limiting interaction among people. She said the caseload in Kansas could surge from the current level of at least 267 to as many as 900 within a week. Kansas also recorded its sixth death from the virus, with new fatalities in Shawnee and Johnson counties.\n\n\"Positive cases are appearing everywhere at this point,\" she said. \"I know this has been hard. I know we have tough days ahead.\"\n\nThe order will remain in place until April 19 and won\u2019t be lifted until consistent evidence of a declining infection rate is in hand, she said. It does permit exceptions that include leaving the home for reasons of personal health or safety, to secure supplies or services and for outdoor activities.\n\nMore than half the state\u2019s population already was under a stay-at-home order issued by county health officials. The governor said she left the decision up to counties for as long as possible.\n\n\"The reality is a patchwork approach is a recipe for confusion in our statewide fight to slow the spread of coronavirus,\" Kelly said. \"Statewide uniformity will ensure we're all playing by the same rules, and it will help prevent an influx of new cases.\"\n\nUnder the statewide order, Kansans must remain at home unless going to work to perform an essential function, obtaining food or medicine, seeking medical care, providing care for children, pets, family or someone who is vulnerable, or exercising outdoors while adhering to social distancing guidelines.\n\n\"You can still go outside,\" the governor said. \"You are not under house arrest.\"\n\nAll individuals performing essential functions must work from home to the extent possible. No individual leaving their home is required to carry or present any letter, ID card or other paper proving they are allowed to leave home.\n\nTwenty-two other states have adopted comparable statewide directives, Kelly said.\n\nThe Kansas Chamber responded positively to the Democratic governor\u2019s order.\n\n\"As the number of Kansas counties issuing stay-at-home orders grew, a patchwork of what were considered \u2019essential\u2019 businesses was beginning to develop. This made it challenging for companies to operate, especially those with multiple locations in our state,\" said Alan Cobb, president of the statewide business organization.\n\nKansas House and Senate leaders on the Legislative Coordinating Council would review the governor\u2019s statewide order in consultation with the attorney general and emergency management officials. A measure adopted by the 2020 Legislature granted the LCC the responsibility for analyzing Kelly\u2019s emergency orders.\n\n\"While I appreciate the governor\u2019s very difficult task, I am concerned about a one-size-fits-all solution,\" said Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita. \"We are not like coastal states and our efforts must be specific to the needs of Kansans.\"\n\nEmotional test\n\nRegistered nurse Ashleigh Adams witnessed the dodged-a-bullet relief of people informed their coronavirus test was negative and the despair of those who had their fear confirmed.\n\nAdams, who works for University of Kansas Health System in Kansas City, Kan., said she initially was assigned to care for KU hospital patients awaiting test results. As the virus infiltrated deeper into Kansas\u2019 population, her assignment shifted to a wing dedicated to people fighting COVID-19.\n\n\"When we would come in and tell them, \u2019Hey, we got your test back. It\u2019s negative.\u2019 You could just see their face \u2014 whew. Right now, we\u2019re dealing with the positives. You\u2019re not seeing that. They\u2019re not getting that relief,\" she said.\n\nThe Kansas Department of Health and Environment said more than 260 confirmed cases of coronavirus had been detected in Kansas. It\u2019s evidence the state was traveling upward on a Nike swoosh infection curve. Five people have died, including three in Wyandotte County. Cases have cropped up in more than 30 counties in Kansas.\n\nOfficials at KDHE believe the infection peak in Kansas could occur in mid-April. The first known case in Kansas was identified on March 7.\n\nVentilator rationing\n\nTessa Goupil, 49, of Topeka, has muscular dystrophy and uses a ventilator. Reliance on the breathing apparatus to care for the most critically ill coronavirus patients led KDHE to issue a protocol to assist health professionals with decisions about prioritizing life-saving treatment.\n\nShe said the state\u2019s approach could have a significant impact on people with disabilities.\n\n\"The message is that my life is not important. My role as a mother, and as a person, is less valuable to the state because I have muscular dystrophy,\" Goupil said. \"It is so devalued that if I need help, my ventilator would be taken away from me by the very medical professionals I would be turning to for help.\"\n\nOn Friday, Goupil joined with the Disability Rights Center of Kansas and Topeka Independent Living Center in filing a complaint about the ventilator protocol with the civil rights office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe complaint alleges KDHE\u2019s policy discriminates against people with disabilities because hospitals responding to the pandemic would be able to remove ventilators from patients with \"advanced untreatable neuromuscular disease,\" \"advanced or irreversible immunocompromise\" and some forms of cancer.\n\n\"Unless it is significantly changed, Kansas\u2019 ventilator rationing policy will relegate members of the Kansas disability community to die,\" said Rocky Nichols, executive director of the Disability Rights Center.\n\nDuring Saturday\u2019s news conference, Kelly said she questions whether disabled Kansans are losing access to ventilators.\n\n\"I think that might be a proactive act on behalf of the disability rights community,\" Kelly said. \"I have not heard of any of that happening.\"\n\nIn harm\u2019s way\n\nLee Norman, who deployed to the Middle East in 2018 as a National Guard officer, sees nurses and doctors serving in harm\u2019s way on the front line in the war against a blitzing pathogen.\n\nThe KDHE secretary also spent 42 years in hospitals before joining the Kelly administration, and this isn\u2019t the first time an infectious disease has threatened populations. Norman recalled \"going through this\" with the Ebola virus in 2014 and H1N1 in 2009.\n\n\"You know, when we had Ebola patients we thought came in, we had no shortage of volunteers,\" Norman said, \"but it was because they were armed with knowledge and equipment to do the work.\"\n\nHealth care workers, Norman said, are altruistically driven. As long as there is some measure of safety for them, they will show up and do great work.\n\n\"One, we have to arm them with information \u2014 what's this about?\" Norman said. \"Second, we have to provide the necessary protective equipment. In this case, we've been strained on that. We have to prioritize.\"\n\nNorman said KDHE is deploying novel solutions for overcoming a shortage of supplies needed in the trenches with the novel coronavirus. The ideas include making gowns from surgical-grade clothing and using ultraviolet light to sterilize and reuse masks.\n\nThe agency also requested dentists and others who do routine medical work to cut back so they use less protective equipment.\n\n\"We need to ship that to the people that are front lines,\" Norman said. \"Traumas are still coming in the door and babies are still being delivered. We need to have the right equipment.\"\n\nKelly said she was mindful of families at home with school-age children and parents out of work. The governor said her administration is doing everything it can to make a difficult situation less difficult.\n\nFor now, she said, officials are trying to \"buy the time we all need to get through this virus and get life back to normal.\"\n\n\"I appreciate what Kansans are doing right now,\" Kelly said. \"We'll continue to work hard on their behalf, and I'll continue to hope this is all over soon. If we just stick together, we will get through this. We've been through hard times before.\"\n\nDoor-knob factor\n\nPhysician Steve Stites said the most significant contribution that could be made by Kansans from a public health perspective would be to stay at home.\n\nAnd, he said, channel fear of coronavirus into vigilant adherence to social distancing principles. That includes washing hands and staying 6 feet from people.\n\nThe virus is spread by person-to-person respiratory droplets during close contact. Symptoms include a cough, fever and difficulty breathing. However, some carriers of the virus show no symptoms.\n\n\"I call it the door-knob principle,\" said Stites, chief of staff at the KU Health System. \"If you go out, you don\u2019t know how many people have touched that darn door knob. When you\u2019re at home, you have control over your environment.\"\n\nHe said people could effectively isolate themselves in the home.\n\n\"Coronavirus doesn\u2019t jump across time and space,\" the doctor said. \"It doesn\u2019t crawl across the carpeting. It has to have some form of direct contact from one person to another.\"\n\nFeeling good\n\nIt is OK to be anxious during this unprecedented time, said Greg Nawalanic, clinical psychologist at The University of Kansas Health System.\n\nMaybe you could learn to play guitar.\n\nNawalanic offered some advice for coping with the stress of staying at home. We are in uncharted territory, he said, but know that if we make sacrifices now, we will get through this sooner.\n\n\"No one\u2019s going to war,\" Nawalanic said. \"We\u2019re asked to sit at home and couch surf.\"\n\nExcept, don\u2019t do that. It is important to get outside for some time every day, he said. You will feel better if you go for a walk.\n\nAnother idea: Take advantage of the three months of free lessons being offered by Fender, the guitar maker.\n\nMake it a goal to get restful sleep at night.\n\n\"The best advice we can give is turn off all the screens \u2014 the phones, the iPads, the laptops, the email, the news, any of it \u2014 an hour before your intended actual bedtime,\" Nawalanic said. \"You say, 'Oh, what do I do in that last hour before bed?' You can try reading a book. That worked for years for people. You can also talk to one another. If you've got kids, spend time with them.\"\n\nStephen Lassen, a pediatric psychologist with the KU Health System, encouraged parents to focus on maintaining routines, which provide comfort to children.\n\nSchool being out takes away structure, Lassen said, so be sure to stick with morning and bedtime routines. Parents should create a new schedule to maintain.\n\n\"We're really in uncharted territory for kids and adults and parents \u2014 parents working from home, kids not going to school \u2014 and so we're on this collision course, if we're not careful, of things really becoming very stressful, very difficult at home,\" Lassen said.\n\nParents can expect more behavior issues from children. They should remember, Lassen said, that outbursts are usually caused by stress. He suggested parents have conversations about the source of stress: I\u2019m frustrated I can\u2019t go into work, and what is it like to not see your friends?\n\n\"For sure, there's going to be a learning curve here for everyone,\" Lassen said. \"Kids are actually pretty resilient. If we get those things in place, they will respond accordingly and do quite well. But there's going to be a period of transition here where everyone's getting used to the new routine.\"","category":"shelter_in_place","population":123.0,"lat":39.8415,"lng":-96.5199}

What we\u2019re trying to say is how can we make sure that we don\u2019t see a significant impact before we can handle it here in Kansas City,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter, Lucas wrote that \"all events with more than 1,000 attendees within the city are canceled or delayed until the emergency has been lifted.\"\n\nSoon after, officials with the Big 12 conference canceled the men's and women's basketball tournaments in downtown Kansas City.\n\nIn a press conference later, Lucas said he understands frustration over not being able to attend sporting events, concerts or other large gatherings.\n\n\u201cTrust me, we are in the business of collecting tax revenues and that sort of thing, so we don\u2019t come to these decisions lightly. But we understand that it\u2019s vital that we take an important leadership position on prevention,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nLucas has also put a moratorium on all \"non-essential travel for City employees until the emergency has been lifted.\"\n\nAs of Thursday, schools in Kansas City remain open. Churches with large congregations are encouraged to use their discretion on whether to cancel services. Private businesses with offices of 1000-plus people are not affected by the ban on large events.\n\nKansas City, Missouri, currently has no confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but health officials say spread to Kansas City is inevitable.\n\n\"We're working diligently across departments to prevent potential spread \u2014 and we're asking our community members and business owners to do their part in helping to prevent potential spread,\" Lucas said.\n\nDr. Rex Archer, director of the Kansas City Health Department says the city has tested fewer than a dozen people for the virus and none have tested presumptive positive.\n\nStill, Archer told reporters Thursday he believes it is likely that there are already mild, undiagnosed cases in Kansas City. He\u2019s encouraging people not to shake hands and even discourages fist-bumps and elbow taps, as bacteria can still be transferred.\n\n\u201cThink about just greeting people with the hand over the heart or a namaste. We need to break this cycle to keep this virus from moving around,\u201d Archer said.\n\nUnder a state of emergency, the city has the power to enact a curfew, bar the sale of liquor or close businesses, but Lucas said he has no plans to take any of those measures at this point.\n\nKansas City buses and Kansas City International Airport remain open.\n\n\"Protecting all of our residents remains our top priority, which means that how we interact over the weeks and months ahead will need to change dramatically as we confront our current public health challenge,\" Lucas said. \"I appreciate our community's understanding during this ever-changing time and encourage all residents to continue exercising good judgment.\"\n\nArcher said that the precautions the city took Thursday will help prevent the spread of the virus, but they will not protect the most vulnerable people from contracting it.\n\nStill, Lucas said people who are young and healthy do not need to avoid gathering in groups.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a mass quarantine or the area,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nIndependence Mayor Eileen Weir also declared a state of emergency in her city Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have detailed emergency plans in place for each of our departments and with this declaration these emergency operation plans have been activated,\" Weir said. \"We will make a detailed announcement tomorrow with the changes citizens and the public will see to City services and operations.\u201d\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, Jackson County Executive Frank White, Jr., announced that the Kansas City state of emergency would expand to all of Jackson County.

These measures are especially important because housing disruption inhibits the ability of the state and local communities to effectively respond to COVID-19 and the public health dangers it presents.\n\n#20-11\n\nKelly signed Executive Order #20-11, which prevents all Kansas waste removal providers, trash and recycling, from cancelling or suspending commercial or residential waste or recycling removal services for Kansas residences and businesses as a result of nonpayment due to significant loss of income or increase in expenses resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ensuring that waste and recycling services continue is essential to maintaining public health, especially when personal hygiene and staying at home are the primary methods for slowing the spread of COVID-19.\n\n#20-12\n\nKelly signed Executive Order #20-12, extending deadlines for driver\u2019s licenses and vehicle registration renewals and regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic. All driver\u2019s license renewals and vehicle registrations extended by this Executive Order must be completed within 60 days of the expiration of Executive Order #20-12. Many Kansans may be unable to renew their driver\u2019s license or vehicle registration during this time, but delivery drivers and other critical employees must be able to continue critical operations and drive without fear of licensing or registration issues.\n\n#20-13\n\nKelly signed Executive Order #20-13, extending tax filing deadlines to July 15, 2020, and waiving any interest and penalties for returns and payments made on or before July 15, 2020. In the event the State of Disaster Emergency originally proclaimed on March 12, 2020, is lifted or expires prior to July 15, 2020, the Department of Revenue shall continue to exercise appropriate discretion to make effective the waivers of penalties and interest for payments made up to July 15, 2020. This order is intended to bring Kansas\u2019 tax filing procedures in line with federal IRS measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","category":"None","population":46782.0,"lat":38.8137,"lng":-97.6143}

McCaul, Peters, Engel, Guthrie, Eshoo, Hudson, Schrader, Bilirakis Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Prevent Critical Access Drug Shortages","text":"WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Today, Rep. Michael McCaul (TX-10), Rep. Scott Peters (CA-52), Rep. Eliot Engel (NY-16), Rep. Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18), Rep. Richard Hudson (NC-08), Rep. Kurt Schrader (OR-05), and Rep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-12) introduced the bipartisan Preventing Drug Shortages Act, which would help address the critical issue of drug shortages that affect the quality of care patients receive across the country. The introduction of the bill comes days after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first U.S. drug shortage related to factory shutdowns and shipping problems in China due to the recent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\nAccording to the FDA, in recent years drug shortages have steadily increased, and supply chains may become further stressed by the challenges associated with the new coronavirus outbreak. Most drug shortages stem from a supply chain interruption, often created by natural disasters, over-reliance on foreign pharmaceutical products, or manufacturing and distribution problems. These shortages threaten the adequate delivery of first-rate patient care, as deficiencies of drugs commonly used by hospitals to treat acute conditions, including bacterial infections and cancer treatment, can severely limit Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving medicines.\n\nThe Preventing Drug Shortages Act would help mitigate these shortage triggers by enhancing transparency throughout the drug supply chain process and strengthening FDA interagency efforts to fend off drug shortages. The bill would also empower the FDA to enforce greater reporting standards on drug and active pharmaceutical ingredient makers to identify and correct vulnerabilities in their supply chains.\n\n\u201cOur country\u2019s drug supply is heavily reliant on China, as we have seen in a recent drug shortage due to the Coronavirus outbreak. The Preventing Drug Shortages Act is a step in the right direction in addressing prevention, notification, and mitigation strategies not just in regards to China, but our entire drug supply chain,\u201d said Rep. McCaul. \u201cIf a manufacturer has a contingency plan in place, and gives the FDA enough notice, the better the FDA can find alternatives to keep supply consistent. A patient should not be at risk because there was a failure of the supply chain.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrug shortages under normal circumstances result in significant strain throughout our healthcare system\u2014from patients to hospitals and physicians,\u201d said Rep. Peters. \u201cUnfortunately, the health emergency presented by COVID-19 is exacerbating these problems and we are already beginning to experience its adverse reactions on global drug supply chains. While we may never be able to predict or fully prevent the challenges posed by situations like the coronavirus outbreak, Congress should take steps to fortify drug supply chains. By strengthening efforts across the board to prevent drug deficiencies, my bill would help ensure America\u2019s health centers have access to the proper resources they need so that patients can continue to receive reliable treatments.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the number of coronavirus cases grows in New York, it\u2019s critical that we take all proactive steps to ensure our health care providers have the medications to treat affected New Yorkers,\u201d said Rep. Engel. \u201cMany of our critical medications are sourced from China and India. The growing outbreaks in these countries and the first reported coronavirus-related drug shortage underscore the need to protect and secure our drug supply chain needs. I am pleased to help author this bipartisan legislation which will help mitigate these issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it is an outbreak like the coronavirus, a natural disaster, or any number of possible interruptions to our drug supply chain, we need to ensure that Americans have access to lifesaving drugs at any time,\u201d said Rep. Guthrie. \u201cThe Preventing Drug Shortages Act will increase transparency in our drug supply chain so we can better identify where our system can be improved. I want to thank Reps. Peters, Engel, Hudson, Eshoo, McCaul, Schrader, and Bilirakis for joining with me in introducing this bipartisan, commonsense legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coronavirus outbreak has demonstrated how susceptible our nation\u2019s drug supply chain is to disruptions that could have devastating impacts on our public health because of our overreliance on China for generic drugs. The Coronavirus has already caused one shortage and it\u2019s unclear if there are more to come,\u201d Rep. Eshoo said. \u201cThis legislation takes some first steps to increase what information the federal government needs to receive from drug manufacturers about ongoing shortages and requires manufacturers to have risk management plans to mitigate the impact of drug shortages that affect the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo often I\u2019ve heard from constituents and providers that access to lifesaving drugs has been interrupted because of a drug shortage. We cannot let this continue to happen, especially as new threats like coronavirus emerge,\u201d said Rep. Hudson. \u201cThe Preventing Drug Shortages Act will bolster the data we have available to recognize these shortfalls earlier and eliminate potential shortages of lifesaving medications. I appreciate the partnership of Reps. Peters, Guthrie, Engel, Eshoo, Schrader, McCaul and Bilirakis in introducing this bipartisan legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe drug supply chain is global and to ensure Americans have access to medicines, we must better understand where our drugs are coming from and how manufacturers will handle disruptions,\u201d said Rep. Schrader. \u201cThis bipartisan bill will help to prevent prescription drug shortages by mitigating interruptions in the drug supply chain like we are seeing with the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Commonsense legislation like this ensures that Americans can access the medications that they need for themselves and their families.\u201d\n\n\u201cFortifying our drug chain will help ensure critical access to necessary medications, especially during emergency situations when the current system has often experienced strain,\u201d said Rep. Bilirakis. \u201cThis common sense, necessary step is integral to protecting public safety and I urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort to expedite passage.\u201d\n\n###","category":"None","population":1391.0,"lat":36.6485,"lng":-87.1739}

He also announced that Georgia will be enforcing social distancing directives at parks, lakes and other outdoor areas.\n\nThe novel coronavirus case count across Georgia rose to 2,683 since Saturday, while Chatham County\u2019s case count was up one to 16, according to the update issued at 7 p.m. Sunday, March 29, by the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nSunday\u2019s update indicates that one new case was diagnosed in Chatham (16) and none in Effingham (4) or Bryan (7). A new case was confirmed in Glynn County, bringing its total to eight.\n\nSaturday\u2019s statewide confirmed-case count was 2,446.\n\nA confirmed case is defined as a person who has tested positive for 2019 novel coronavirus.\n\nCOVID-19 is widespread in Georgia\u2019s coastal counties, Dr. Lawton Davis, the director of the Coastal Health District, said Tuesday.\n\nThere are now 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Coastal Health District, which includes Bryan (7), Camden (2), Chatham (16), Effingham (4), Glynn (8), Liberty (3), Long (1) and McIntosh counties.\n\nDPH also began on Tuesday to report the number of Georgians hospitalized from COVID-19.

Brian Kemp announced Sunday that President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster for all 159 Georgia counties due to the impacts from the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in a statewide public health emergency being declared March 14.\n\n\"Georgia is grateful for this designation, as it will enable the state to continue partnering with federal agencies in a coordinated fight against this pandemic,\" Kemp said in a statement Sunday afternoon. \"The presidential declaration is a critical step in providing additional assistance to our state and local governments as they continue to respond to COVID-19.\"\n\nThe declaration for federal assistance currently covers emergency protective measures, which are those actions taken to eliminate or lessen immediate threats to lives, public health or safety. This declaration also allows federal agencies to provide direct assistance to Georgia.\n\nKemp declared a public health emergency March 14, activating the state emergency operations plan and making available state resources to help address any threats to public health and safety due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs part of the Office of the Governor, the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency works with local, state, and federal governments in partnership with the private sector and faith-based community to protect life and property against man-made and natural emergencies.\n\nIn addition, GEMA\/HS employees are on 24-hour call statewide to assist local authorities when disaster strikes.

They are traveling to nearby counties, heading outdoors for fresh air, and maximizing family time. Some are going to vacation homes, and others are hitting the lake, hiking trails, or campgrounds. We, too, enjoy exploring Georgia, but we urge people to stay mindful of social distancing, follow best practices, and avoid large crowds.\"\n\nThe Department of Natural Resources will enforce the executive order limiting large gatherings with officials patrolling bodies of water and campgrounds. They are monitoring coves where people tend to congregate and, if necessary, using bullhorns to tell people to comply with the order.\n\nOfficials will approach people in violation of the order and demand compliance. Local officials are also trying to ensure compliance with local directives, which vary by city and county across the state.\n\n\"Please stay safe, enjoy your time outdoors, and follow our directives to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,\" the statement read. \"Together, we can flatten the curve and stop the spread of coronavirus.\"","category":"disaster_declaration","population":540.0,"lat":32.3094,"lng":-92.4522}

Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.\n\nMany of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It\u2019s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.\n\nAnother 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":8519.0,"lat":30.3141,"lng":-89.931}

Zrike said all school-related activities and events are canceled, but school-age students can pick up breakfast and lunch at five schools across the city every day from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. during the closure.\n\n\u201cOur priority right now is slowing down the spread of the coronavirus in our community as much as possible,\u201d Morse said, noting the state of emergency allows the city to be eligible for expenses to be reimbursed.\n\nMorse said the city\u2019s second priority is to inform the public about the disruption of several city services. City Hall and its annex will be closed to all public walk-ins, though it will remain open for city staff; those seeking assistance at City Hall can call or email and an appointment may be made if the matter is urgent, Morse said. The city is evaluating a work from home policy for some city employees, he said, adding employees will not have to use accrued time off if they or their children are sick.\n\nThe Holyoke Senior Center, the Holyoke Public Library and Wistariahurst Museum are all closed, though the senior center will still provide lunch by either pickup or drop-off, and social services will visit seniors if necessary.\n\nHolyoke Gas & Electric will remain open, but Morse encouraged citizens to use online transactions. The Holyoke Housing Authority is curtailing public visits to administrative offices and encouraging tenants to contact them for appointments. City parks, along with sports and other events, are canceled until further notice, Morse said, and Community Field will not be staffed as usual and bathrooms will be closed. Permits will not be issued for future events, he said.\n\nMorse said he has requested that all city boards and commissions suspend public meetings until further notice unless necessary. City Council President Todd McGee has suspended council meetings for the next 30 days, according to Morse.\n\nStudents looking to continue picking up breakfast and lunch will be able to do so at the front doors of the Maurice A. Donahue Elementary School, Holyoke High School North, Dr. Marcella R. Kelly Elementary School, H.B. Lawrence Elementary School and Lt. Clayre P. Sullivan Elementary School each day from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m, Zrike said.\n\nParents looking to pick up medication from school nurses can do so Monday and, with the closure, the projected last day of school will be June 23. The schools are looking at possibilities for staff to work from home, Zrike said.\n\nThere will also be optional work for students online and eventually at food distribution locations, Zrike said. Later in the press conference Friday, Morse said officials will work over the weekend \u201cexploring the potential of certain sites being open in the city for children of those parents that frankly just can\u2019t afford time out of work or don\u2019t have the privilege that some people have to work from home.\u201d\n\nSean Gonsalves, the director of the city\u2019s board of health, said many of these efforts help to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of coronavirus infections, reducing the stress put on local medical facilities such as Holyoke Medical Center by delaying cases over a longer period of time. He also said canceling school minimizes potential exposure to the virus.\n\n\u201cWe cannot allow our city resources to be overwhelmed by a sudden demand of services,\u201d Gonsalves said.\n\n\u201cWaiting for the virus to take hold in Holyoke before we decide to act would not be a suitable or safe choice,\u201d he said.\n\nMorse said the city was looking at reallocating Community Development Block Grant funds into food shares and food pantries.\n\n\u201cSome folks may purport that many people who are making decisions are overreacting,\u201d Morse said. \u201cBut if we\u2019re overreacting, we\u2019re doing exactly what we need to do because we need to do our part ... everything that we do locally affects people all across western Mass. and across the state.\u201d\n\nAlso speaking at the press conference was Holyoke Community College President Christina Royal, who announced earlier Friday that the school will suspended in-person classes for one week beginning March 23 \u2014 the week after spring break.\n\nMichael Connors can be reached at mconnors@gazettenet.com.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":803.0,"lat":30.1221,"lng":-92.4985}

The order also outlines ways businesses and citizens should work to protect vulnerable populations.\n\nRELATED: Gov. Lee establishes COVID-19 Unified Command to better coordinate Tennessee's response to coronavirus\n\nRELATED: Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee signs Executive Order 17: suspends in-person dining, closes gyms, takes other measures to slow coronavirus spread\n\nAt the meeting, city council members approved a resolution to declare a local state of emergency to help prevent the spread of novel coronavirus, COVID-19.\n\nIt is a weeklong, renewable executive order that gives Mayor Warren Gooch the authority to extend it further, if necessary. It also included amendments to the number of cases and the addition of the Governor\u2019s Executive Order, according to a release from the City of Oak Ridge.\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your patience,\u201d Mayor Warren Gooch said. \u201cWe are clearly dealing with a difficult situation in our country and locally. Today, we took up measures that we think will protect Oak Ridgers.\u201d\n\nCity Manager Mark Watson presented a resolution regarding emergency leave for city employees, which was approved, and will allow city employees access to emergency leave in the case that they need to be off work and\/or in quarantine due to coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange and interesting time to deal with these issues,\u201d Oak Ridge City Manager Mark Watson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve made changes in operations to be prepared for future actions.\u201d\n\nCity Council also approved Watson\u2019s request for funding for essential employees to be able to stay at several local hotels in order to be in the city during this time. This is for city employees who have no illness but need to stay in the city for their job.\n\nCOVID-19 is also expected to have an impact on city utilities, according to the release from the city.\n\nElectric director Jack Suggs said his department is working with Tennessee Valley Authority to get some funding to be able to stop utility disconnects for the immediate future.\n\nThis means if a citizen is unable to pay their bill during this time, their services won\u2019t be cut off, according to city officials. However, bills for this service will continue to accrue and the city will be flexible in terms of repayment.\n\nSuggs said utilities would be able to work with people to help them get back on their feet.\n\nInstead of disconnection notices, a citizen who doesn\u2019t pay their entire bill on time will receive a letter to let them know that their bills are adding up. The letter serves as a reminder that they can pay whatever they can afford now so they won\u2019t have as much to pay at the end, according to the city.\n\nSuggs also said services like the \u2018Aid To Distressed Families of Appalachian Counties\u2019, or ADFAC, are available for folks in need. ADFAC can be reached at (865) 483-6028 for utilities or rent assistance.\n\nThe city said fire staff and first responders are taking protective actions and standardizing responses between ambulances and the fire department. Leaders are in touch with Methodist Medical and paying close attention to the number of beds available. The City Manager and senior staff have been working hard to ensure that everyone is prepared.\n\nOak Ridge city officials said many have expressed concerns over testing in the area and whether there will be an order requiring people to stay home. An official \u2018shelter at home\u2019 order would need to come from the county health department, meaning the Roane County Health Department and Anderson County Health Department.\n\nThe city said it is doing everything it can to protect its citizens and while it may not be able to issue an order, leaders can make strong recommendations to urge people to stay home, especially if they are sick.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to move forward and monitor all circumstances and situations,\u201d Gooch said. \u201cIf we all work together, and I\u2019m confident that we will, we will hopefully be able to reduce the number of tough days going forward.\u201d\n\nThe next regularly scheduled meeting is Monday, April 13. Future meetings and special sessions will be conducted electronically for as long as necessary, the city said. To see the most current information about city facilities, click here.\n\nDue to the Center for Disease Control advisory and Executive Order 17 that limits gatherings of 10 or more individuals, Monday\u2019s meeting was held with essential personnel only and electronically, for city leaders to call in.

Reeves\u2019 coronavirus declaration clash with local orders?","text":"Impatient with what they consider Gov. Tate Reeves\u2019 lack of guidance amid the COVID-19 outbreak, some Mississippi mayors recently placed protective restrictions on their towns\u2019 residents and businesses.\n\nThen, Reeves issued his own sweeping executive order.\n\nBut which takes precedence?\n\nThat\u2019s the question leaders of some of the state\u2019s largest cities and counties found themselves scrambling to answer on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve preferred that the governor enacted an executive order sooner that impacted all of us the same so we weren\u2019t creating confusion for people,\u201d Starkville Mayor Lynn Spruill told Mississippi Today, adding that the city would follow Reeves\u2019 order.\n\n\u201cBut now that it\u2019s done, we\u2019ll have the continuity and clarity that keeps us from enacting the things that are specific to us but might not match neighboring communities.\u201d\n\nReeves\u2019 legal team designed the executive order to serve as a minimum standard for the state\u2019s cities and counties, his office said on Wednesday. But confusion subsequently abounded in town halls across the state as Reeves\u2019 statewide order clashed with orders local governments had previously passed.\n\nThe statewide order, which Reeves signed Tuesday evening, considers most businesses in the state as \u201cessential\u201d and are therefore exempt. Several cities and counties had previously defined \u201cessential businesses\u201d more narrowly.\n\nFor example, the governor\u2019s order limits gatherings in public or private places to no more than 10 people, but allows restaurants to keep dining rooms open as long as fewer than 10 people are inside at once. Many cities and counties had previously required restaurants to close their dining rooms completely.\n\nReeves\u2019 order is not as broad as gubernatorial declarations in other states \u2014 many of which have included stay-at-home orders \u2014 and does not outline any enforcement measures that can be taken against people or businesses that violate the order.\n\nSeveral mayors joined conference calls on Wednesday to compare notes and try to determine what, if anything, should be done at the local level to reach compliance with the governor\u2019s order.\n\nAmid the confusion at the local level, staffers for Reeves fielded several calls from mayors and local attorneys seeking clarification on Wednesday. Reeves himself participated in a conference call on Wednesday afternoon with representatives of the Mississippi Municipal League and several of the state\u2019s mayors to discuss the ramifications of his order.\n\nCity of Tupelo\n\nThe City of Oxford called an emergency board of aldermen meeting on Wednesday to determine how their previously passed resolutions fit with the governor\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d read the governor\u2019s order and believed from our first reading that it would supersede the resolutions we had in place,\u201d Oxford Mayor Robyn Tannehill said in the meeting. \u201cWe felt that ours would not be able to stay in place based on the language in the order. But I just got off the phone with the governor, and we\u2019ve come to the conclusion that all our resolutions can stay in place.\u201d\n\nTupelo Mayor Jason Shelton \u2014 who blasted Reeves publicly last week, highlighting \u201cjust an abdication of leadership at the highest level of the state of Mississippi\u201d \u2014 is expected to issue an amended order on Wednesday to comply with the governor\u2019s statewide order, the Daily Journal reported. The Tupelo City Council is meeting Wednesday evening to discuss the matter.\n\nVicksburg Mayor George Flaggs told Mississippi Today he has not changed his city\u2019s policies based on the governor\u2019s order and said he does not believe the order limits what he can do in his town to fight the virus.

The center, opened March 23, can test up to 500 people per day for the coronavirus. John Moore\/Getty Images\n\nWhile the National Guard and reserves may be familiar organizations to most people, many could ask what is the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR)?\n\nUnlike the others, the IRR is not an actual organized force structure that trains together regularly. This is because the National Guard and reserves are part of what are called the \"active reserves\" and the IRR is the inactive conterpart.\n\nThe IRR consists of a pool of former servicemembers who have recently left active military service, but still have time left to serve on their military contracts.\n\nTypically, every servicemember signs an enlistment contract or re-enlistment contract that keeps them in active duty for two to four years.\n\nArizona National Guard members pack and sort food items at a food bank, March 26, 2020, in Mesa, Ariz. The Guard was at the food bank performing one of their first missions since they were activated by Gov. Doug Ducey to bolster the supply chain for food amid surging demand in response to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Matt York\/AP\n\nBut those contracts are actually for eight years, and servicemembers are told that when they leave the military they can either finish up the balance of time they have left by moving into the National Guard, the reserves or the IRR.\n\nThose who enter the IRR do so with the understanding that they could be called back to duty if the need arises.\n\nMost of those who leave the military choose the IRR option, knowing that it is highly unlikely that they will be called back into military service.\n\nAt the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan it was a big shock to thousands of former servicemembers who were called back to duty because they were trained in jobs that were hard to fill or hard to train.\n\nWhen enlisted servicemembers eventually pass the eight year cycle of the recruitment contract, they are no longer available for military service.\n\nBut that's not the case for commissioned military officers, they are always available to be called back to duty as part of the IRR.\n\nIt remains unclear if Trump's executive order wiill actually lead to any call-ups from individuals in the IRR.\n\n\"Decisions about which individuals may be activated are still being reviewed,\" said Jonathan Rath Hoffman, the Pentagon's chief spokesman. \"Generally, these members will be persons in headquarters units and persons with high demand medical capabilities whose call-up would not adversely affect their civilian communities.\"\n\nThe president's order also authorized the Pentagon to send more National Guard and reserve units to assist with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"The Department has been committed to using all our capabilities to confront the coronavirus outbreak, and the president's action today ensures that we can bring select members of the Reserves and National Guard to the fight where needed most,\" Hoffman said.\n\nOn Saturday, U.S. Army North announced the activation of 800 soldiers from National Guard and reserve units.\n\nA U.S. official told ABC News that their activation was a direct result of the president's action, because otherwise, the Army would not have been able to call them up to active duty.\n\nWhat to know about coronavirus:\n\nHow it started and how to protect yourself: coronavirus explained\n\nWhat to do if you have symptoms: coronavirus symptoms\n\nTracking the spread in the US and Worldwide: coronavirus map\n\nThis report was featured in the Monday, March 30, 2020, episode of \u201cStart Here,\u201d ABC News\u2019 daily news podcast.\n\n\"Start Here\" offers a straightforward look at the day's top stories in 20 minutes.

Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.\n\n\u2022 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n\u2022 Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\n\n\u2022 Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\n\u2022 Stay home when you are sick.\n\n\u2022 Avoid contact with sick people.\n\n\u2022 Avoid non-essential travel.\n\nFor the latest factual information on COVID-19, you're encouraged to check both the Virginia Department of Health and the CDC.\n\n","category":"state_of_emergency","population":20481.0,"lat":30.4019,"lng":-91.002}

We can't allow the actions of a few to put us all at risk.\"\n\nMr Gething said the Welsh Government will report to the assembly on the use of the powers.\n\n\"I think in reality we will be making public statements about the use of powers every time we use them,\" he said.\n\nThe law includes measures aimed at freeing up resources in public services.\n\nMinisters will be able to instruct schools to close, or to remain open.\n\nPowers will allow the redeployment of teachers to address shortages, remove standard ratios of staff-to-children requirements, and allow people to return more rapidly to the workplace.\n\nIn health and social care, the bill will allow ministers to state circumstances where DBS criminal record checks can be \"disapplied\".\n\nAt a UK level, airports could be shut and more court hearings could take place by phone or video.","category":"None","population":2633.0,"lat":30.2355,"lng":-92.8135}

Please support local journalism by subscribing to the Herald-Citizen at buy.mypapertoday.com.\n\nBEVERLY \u2014 In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the city of Beverly has officially declared a public health emergency. The declaration came just days before the first five cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the city.\n\nMayor Michael P. Cahill, along with members of the Beverly Board of Health and other government officials, made the declaration during a teleconference meeting held Friday morning, March 20. Cahill also declared a state of emergency in the city earlier that same day.\n\nThese actions were taken so city officials can \u201ctake immediate action to prepare for, prevent, respond to and mitigate damage to public health that may otherwise result from the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Cahill said the first five positive cases of the virus were confirmed.\n\n\u201cThe individuals diagnosed are either isolating at home or being cared for as inpatients in the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask you to join me in keeping these neighbors of ours in your thoughts and prayers as they fight to recover from this virus.\u201d\n\nTests for the new coronavirus only became available about a week ago, and Cahill said the five confirmed cases are results from the first batch of patients tested.\n\n\u201cWe will assuredly see more confirmed cases in Beverly and throughout the region in the coming days, weeks and months,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why our focus on extreme social distancing is so critically important. We must slow the spread of this virus so that our hospitals are not overwhelmed to the point that critically ill patients cannot receive the lifesaving treatment they will need.\u201d\n\nIn addition, government buildings, including Beverly City Hall, Beverly Public Library (both branches) and Beverly Senior Center will remain closed through April 5; all public schools are closed until at least April 7.\n\nPlay structures, courts closed\n\nEffective immediately, all play structures and tennis and basketball courts located in public parks and playgrounds in Beverly are closed through April 5.\n\nIn a robo-call to residents on Thursday evening, Cahill again stressed the importance of social distancing, which includes avoiding coming into close contact with others or sharing equipment that isn\u2019t regularly sanitized.\n\n\u201cWe still encourage people to get outside and enjoy our open spaces,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cBut it is essential to stay at least six feet apart and not to share sporting equipment or touch the same surfaces.\u201d\n\nCahill said, for the time being, close contact needs to be limited to immediate family members only.\n\n\u201cAs we know, this is our very best chance to keep ourselves and those we love healthy,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease respect the urgency of this time in human history and do your part. We are a community, and we will make it through this crisis as a community.\u201d\n\nMasks needed\n\nBeverly Hospital is in need of N95 masks.\n\nResidents who have any N95 masks that are new and still in their original packaging should contact Cahill at mayorcahill@beverlyma.gov or call me at City Hall on Monday, March 23, at 978 921-6000.\n\n\u201cOur brave health care workers need our help,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cPlease donate any N95 masks you have.\u201d\n\nYou are not alone\n\nIn a recent call to residents, Cahill also reminded folks to continue to regularly check in with neighbors, especially those living alone.\n\n\u201cAnd for anyone who is feeling a bit isolated or alone, please know you are not,\u201d he said. \u201cWe, your community, care about you.\u201d\n\nThose who are feeling lonely and who want someone to talk with should call the Beverly Senior Center at 978 921-6017; staffers will be happy to chat and answer any questions.\n\n\u201cIf you need help, they'll do their very best,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cAnd if you just want a phone buddy, we can definitely help with that, too.\u201d\n\nFor updates and announcements regarding COVID-19 in the City of Beverly, visit www.beverlyma.gov\/covid-19.\n\n-- Sign up for our newsletter and get important Beverly news delivered straight to your inbox each week.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":41816.0,"lat":42.5681,"lng":-70.8627}

Sullivan announced a local state of emergency at City Hall on Monday afternoon, closing facilities like D.W. Field Golf Course and calling for the cancellation of \"non-essential\" meetings of city government.\n\nBROCKTON \u2013 There is now one confirmed case of the coronavirus in the city of Brockton, according to the mayor.\n\nMayor Robert Sullivan announced a local state of emergency during a news conference held outside City Hall on Monday afternoon and confirmed shortly afterward to The Enterprise that there is now one confirmed case of the coronavirus in the city. Nationwide, there are about 3,500 cases of the coronavirus so far, including 197 cases in Massachusetts. Three of those cases are in Plymouth County, which also includes one case in Hanover and another in Hingham, while two cases have been reported in Bristol County, including one in Easton.\n\n\"We know it's going to get worse before it gets better,\" said Sullivan, in an interview following the news conference, \"I'm concerned as anyone else is. As the mayor, I would take precautions. We're working with all the healthcare professionals to be proactive, advising everyone to follow the medical advice and following the guidelines in the city of Brockton.\"\n\nWe can deliver news just like this directly to your inbox.

It's customized to your preferences -- and it'll only take a few seconds.\n\nIn an eight-minute address in front of City Hall, Sullivan announced that he declared a local state of emergency, urging residents of the city to stay home and avoid group activities.\n\n\"Please treat this as a serious, serious health crisis,\" said Sullivan, flanked by members of his administration. \"By that I mean I ask you to stay at home if you can. Stay at home with your families. Stay around your home or in your home. Yesterday, I drove by the Edgar Playground. I saw 50 kids playing. Now's not the time to do that.\"\n\nSullivan said the local state of emergency will allow the city government to access state and federal resources to better serve the community, coordinate resources, obtain medical supplies and get reimbursement for costs incurred as a result of the public health crisis. In addition, Sullivan said he is closing the Council on Aging, shutting down the Brockton Public Library and all of its branches and suspending all permits for activities that are scheduled to be held at city-owned facilities. Sullivan also said that City Hall will remain open, but visitors will be restricted to \"essential services,\" while \"non-essential city meetings\" will be canceled through March 30.\n\n(Editor's note: This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. Please support local journalism by subscribing to The Enterprise.)\n\n\"It's unprecedented times right now in the history of the United States; it's a health crisis, it's a pandemic,\" Sullivan said.\n\nSullivan repeated the city's earlier announcement, coinciding with an order from Gov. Charlie Baker, that schools will be canceled through April 6, and Sullivan reinforced the ban of on-site consumption at restaurants and bars, which are only allowed to provide takeout or delivery orders starting today. Sullivan also said the Baker administration is offering a $10 million loan fund for small businesses affected by the coronavirus.\n\nSullivan urged city boards to cancel meetings and to hold \"essential meetings\" virtually via phone or video chat, which he said is in accordance with a temporary revision of the state's Open Meeting Law under an executive order declared by Baker. Residents in need of city services should conduct them through the city's website, www.brockton.ma.us, and Sullivan said that all convenience fees for transactions will be waived during this time.\n\n\"This is extremely important,\" he said.\n\nFor those going to City Hall, only one entrance on the ground floor will be open.\n\nSullivan urged city residents to follow guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including washing hands, keeping 6 feet of \"social distance\" and avoiding handshakes.\n\n\n\nHowever, Sullivan did make a little mistake himself, accidentally shaking hands during the news conference with his newly appointed interim executive health officer, John McGarry.\n\n\"It's kind of a habit,\" said Sullivan, asked about it after the meeting. \"But we need to break that habit, all of us.\"","category":"state_of_emergency","population":95672.0,"lat":42.0821,"lng":-71.0242}

Zrike said all school-related activities and events are canceled, but school-age students can pick up breakfast and lunch at five schools across the city every day from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. during the closure.\n\n\u201cOur priority right now is slowing down the spread of the coronavirus in our community as much as possible,\u201d Morse said, noting the state of emergency allows the city to be eligible for expenses to be reimbursed.\n\nMorse said the city\u2019s second priority is to inform the public about the disruption of several city services. City Hall and its annex will be closed to all public walk-ins, though it will remain open for city staff; those seeking assistance at City Hall can call or email and an appointment may be made if the matter is urgent, Morse said. The city is evaluating a work from home policy for some city employees, he said, adding employees will not have to use accrued time off if they or their children are sick.\n\nThe Holyoke Senior Center, the Holyoke Public Library and Wistariahurst Museum are all closed, though the senior center will still provide lunch by either pickup or drop-off, and social services will visit seniors if necessary.\n\nHolyoke Gas & Electric will remain open, but Morse encouraged citizens to use online transactions. The Holyoke Housing Authority is curtailing public visits to administrative offices and encouraging tenants to contact them for appointments. City parks, along with sports and other events, are canceled until further notice, Morse said, and Community Field will not be staffed as usual and bathrooms will be closed. Permits will not be issued for future events, he said.\n\nMorse said he has requested that all city boards and commissions suspend public meetings until further notice unless necessary. City Council President Todd McGee has suspended council meetings for the next 30 days, according to Morse.\n\nStudents looking to continue picking up breakfast and lunch will be able to do so at the front doors of the Maurice A. Donahue Elementary School, Holyoke High School North, Dr. Marcella R. Kelly Elementary School, H.B. Lawrence Elementary School and Lt. Clayre P. Sullivan Elementary School each day from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m, Zrike said.\n\nParents looking to pick up medication from school nurses can do so Monday and, with the closure, the projected last day of school will be June 23. The schools are looking at possibilities for staff to work from home, Zrike said.\n\nThere will also be optional work for students online and eventually at food distribution locations, Zrike said. Later in the press conference Friday, Morse said officials will work over the weekend \u201cexploring the potential of certain sites being open in the city for children of those parents that frankly just can\u2019t afford time out of work or don\u2019t have the privilege that some people have to work from home.\u201d\n\nSean Gonsalves, the director of the city\u2019s board of health, said many of these efforts help to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of coronavirus infections, reducing the stress put on local medical facilities such as Holyoke Medical Center by delaying cases over a longer period of time.

Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.\n\nPrevention & Treatment\n\nThere is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\nStay home when you are sick.\n\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.\n\nPeople who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately.\n\nQuestion about coronavirus?

As of early this week, two cases had tested presumptively positive \u2014 two people who live in the same home \u2014 for the virus.\n\n\u201cOur intent in proclaiming a public health emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19 is to ensure maximum access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission,\u201d Dr. Annette Mercatante, medical health officer for the department, said in a statement.\n\nHealth officials didn't clarify what resources would be needed.\n\nWhen asked, health department spokeswoman Jennifer Michaluk said that's only determined after a local, regional and statewide assessment.\n\n\"If resources are quickly depleting, or projected to do so, request(s) for additional resources are submitted through the local EOC and\/or State EOCs,\" she said in an email late Tuesday.

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nBlack Press Media posted these files from the Associated Press at 5 p.m., Saturday, March 28.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\nSpain\u2019s deadliest day has over 800 deaths, over 8,000 news cases.\n\nTrump raises idea of quarantine for New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.\n\nItaly\u2019s COVID-19 deaths down slightly from previous day.\n\nFuture of EU at risk, Spain says\n\nFrance orders 1 billion protective masks\n\nTrump floats 2-week quarantine of NYC, Gov. Cuomo calls it \u2018federal declaration of war\u2019\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014President Donald Trump said Saturday that he may order an \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d for New York City and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut \u2014prompting surprise and shock from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\u201cThis would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I\u2019d rather not do it, but we may need it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCuomo likened such a quarantine to a \u201cfederal declaration of war\u201d on the city and state. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. \u2026 I don\u2019t think it is plausible. I don\u2019t think it is legal,\u201d he said hours later on CNN.\n\nSuch an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. In China, a two-month lockdown in Wuhan, where the new coronavirus emerged, began easing only on Saturday.\n\nNew York has roughly half of the nation\u2019s confirmed cases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at it and will be making a decision. A lot of the states that are infected \u2014 they\u2019ve asked me if I\u2019d look at it so we\u2019re going to look at it,\u201d Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One for a short flight to Norfolk, Va., for a visit to a Navy hospital ship headed to New York. \u201cIt would be for a short time.\u201d\n\nCuomo\u2019s immediate reaction: No thanks.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the sound of it,\u201d he told reporters in Albany. \u201cI don\u2019t know how that could be legally enforceable, and from a medical point of view I don\u2019t know what you would be accomplishing.\n\nFrance orders a billion protective masks\n\nPARIS \u2014 France has ordered more than one billion protective masks, mainly from China, to try to make up for a shortage that is being felt in nations fighting the coronavirus pandemic, Health Minister Olivier Veran announced.\n\nBut French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, noting tensions in world markets, suggested at a news conference that traffickers and black marketeers are now in the mask business, given the competition in procuring the vital necessity for health workers.\n\nVeran said that an \u201cair bridge\u201d to China was being put in place, but \u201cI will have the certitude (the masks arrived) \u2026 only the minute the planes are on the tarmac.\u201d He said one major difficulty is that countries already hit by the virus remain vigilant that should the epidemic return they are equipped.\n\nAs of Saturday, France had 37,575 confirmed cases and 2,314 deaths \u2014 with 319 new deaths in the last 24 hours, health authorities said.\n\nThe prime minister warned the French that \u201cthe fight has just begun.\u201d\n\nInfant dies of COVID-19\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death.\n\nOfficials didn\u2019t release other information about the infant, who was from Cook County, which includes Chicago, including whether the child had other health issues.\n\nThe risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.\n\nChildren have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized.\n\nSeparate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old. The study found less than 6% of children were seriously ill.\n\nItaly: COVID-19 crisis an \u201cappointment with history\u201d\n\nROME \u2014 Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte is hoping the European Union will put together a cohesive response to the plight of countries like his, whose economy has been crippled by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nConte vowed to fight \u201cto my very last drop of sweat\u201d to prompt a \u201cstrong and cohesive European response.\u201d Conte echoed an appeal the same evening by Spain, which is also reeling under a devastating COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nConte called the crisis \u201can appointment with history. Europe must say if it\u2019s ready for this appointment\u201d to effectively deal with social and economic shock wreaked by the pandemic.\n\nGermany and the Netherlands are leading other EU nations in resisting calls for an issuance of joint European debt, colloquially dubbed \u201ccoronabonds.\u201d Italian Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri expressed dismay that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in an interview described the bond idea as a \u201conly a slogan.\u201d\n\nCrisis may delay Polish elections\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Poland President Andrzej Duda says the May 10 date for the presidential election may not be realistic if the coronavirus spread continues and Poland remains under the current strict isolation regime for the citizens.\n\nDuda\u2019s words were the first sign from the ruling team that the elections may not be held as planned.\n\nEarlier Saturday, the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party had the parliament approve changes to the electoral law to allow sick, quarantined and elderly people to vote remotely, in a clear preparation for May election.\n\nFlorida governor supports NYC quarantine\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Fla. \u2014 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump, tells reporters he had spoken with the president about the possibility of a coronavirus quarantine for the New York City area.\n\nDeSantis says Florida will soon set up a checkpoint along Interstate 95 to screen travellers from that area, similar to one already in place along Interstate 10 to screen people from Louisiana. Many airports in Florida also are screening travellers from certain areas, requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\n\u201cI think whatever works is what we need to do,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe\u2019re either fighting the virus or we\u2019re not. The more people are being shuttled around the country, I just think it makes it more difficult. I think it would make it a lot easier if we didn\u2019t have folks coming in from hot zones.\u201d\n\nSome South Carolina cities defy governor\u2019s opposition to stay-at-home orders\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 Leaders of several South Carolina cities say they are defying Gov. Henry McMaster\u2019s opposition to stay-at-home orders and Attorney General Alan Wilson\u2019s opinion that only McMaster can issue such measures.\n\nIn Folly Beach, where town officials had removed their checkpoint and had allowed vacation rentals to resume, the city council unanimously voted to re-establish the checkpoint and ban any new short-term rentals beginning Sunday.\n\nColumbia Mayor Steve Benjamin says on Twitter that his city\u2019s stay-at-home order would take effect at 12:01 a.m. Sunday as scheduled. He says Wilson\u2019s Friday opinion is \u201cincorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis.\u201d\n\nItaly frees up $400 million euros for food coupons and food aid\n\nROME \u2014 Three weeks into national containment measures that have shut down most shops and non-essential industry, many Italians are hurting for food money during the lockdown amid the country\u2019s devastating COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nItalian Premier Giuseppe Conte told the nation he has signed a decree freeing up 400 million euros ($440 million) for food coupons and packages of food aid. Volunteers from Italy\u2019s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.\n\nConte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: \u201cPeople are suffering psychologically, they\u2019re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.\u201d\n\nConte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.\n\nGermany: 12 die in nursing home\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.\n\nAuthorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn\u2019t shown symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nLocal officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.\n\nAnother nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.\n\nGermany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.\n\nFirst coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.\n\nOne person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.\n\nThere are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nThe Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.\n\nSpain: Future of the EU is at stake\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc\u2019s southern flank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.\n\nSanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.\n\nHe calls for a \u201cnew Marshall Plan\u201d to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.\n\nItaly and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.\n\nSpain: Commuting ban starts Monday\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.\n\nSanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home \u201cas if it were a weekend\u201d to \u201cintensify\u201d efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nSpain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.\n\nSpain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.\n\nNew Orleans one of U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 hot spots\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.\n\nThe donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.\n\n\u201cLike many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,\u201d New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.\n\nNew Orleans is one of the nation\u2019s hot spots for coronavirus.\n\nItaly\u2019s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.\n\nCivil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north. That compares to 969 a day earlier, which was a one-day high in the country which has the world\u2019s highest number of deaths of persons with confirmed cases of the coronavirus.\n\nThe day-to-day rise in new cases was just under 6,000, about the same as the previous day\u2019s figure. Overall, Italy has at least 92,472 cases of COVID-19 and days ago surpassed the total of China, where the outbreak began in early 2020.\n\nThe current national lock-down decree expires on April 3, but health experts have said the need to try to contain contagion in the outbreak will likely last weeks beyond that.\n\nU.N. donates protective masks to NYC\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has announced the donation of 250,000 protective face masks, which had just been located in United Nations storage facilities, to the United States for use in hard-hit New York City.\n\nThe U.N. chief says: \u201cThese masks, in surplus to United Nations requirements, will be given to the medical professionals in New York City who have been working courageously, selflessly, and tirelessly in response to the spread of COVID-19 across the boroughs in the hope that they play some small role in saving lives.\u201d\n\nGuterres says the United Nations and the U.S. Mission to the U.N. are working with Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s office to ensure swift delivery of the masks to medical facilities around the city.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the U.N. community and the diplomatic corps, we sincerely hope this modest donation makes a difference,\u201d Guterres said.\n\nIllnesses in Detroit, a national hot spot for COVID-19, predicted to worsen next week\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration for Michigan, providing additional money to help the state address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe declaration announced by the White House on Saturday follows a back-and-forth between Trump and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who has criticized the Trump administration for its slow response to the pandemic, saying \u201cwe cannot weather this alone.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. surgeon general said Friday that Detroit, a national \u201chot spot\u201d for cases of the new coronavirus, will worsen next week. More than 3,600 people in Michigan were confirmed to have COVID-19 Friday. At least 92 have died, most from the three counties in the Detroit area, according to state officials.\n\nDetroit has recorded 28 deaths and 1,166 cases, according to the city\u2019s health department.","category":"quarantine","population":1846.0,"lat":42.6172,"lng":-83.3331}

However, the Albert Lea American Legion post now has to cut its losses.\n\n\"Anything we can't freeze until we reopen next, we're selling,\" Heien said. \"Even stuff like raw tomatoes.\"\n\nWith no income, the post is finding it hard to serve the veterans it aims to help, especially with supplies.\n\n\"They're running out in stores and we're trying to put funds together just to shop for some of the older generation of veterans,\" said Heien.\n\nThe businesses that have stayed open have had to enact new policies such as limited the amount of toilet paper sold and having special hours for senior citizens to shop.\n\n\"We ask that you do support those local businesses,\" said Albert Lea Mayor Vern Rasmussen Jr. \"This is going to be a challenging time for all our businesses. We need to all help to keep the health of our community that way.\"\n\nThe Albert Lea Library, Arena, City Hall and Senior Center will be closed until April 15.\n\n\"Stay at home if you can if at all possible,\" the mayor said. \"Wash your hands and keep that social distancing if you do have to be out in the public.

Doug Burgum have been holding weekly discussions with tribal leaders across the state about the situation.\n\nAll reservations have clinics, with two of the tribes operating hospitals at Fort Yates on the Standing Rock reservation and Belcourt at Fort Berthold. Sioux County has a confirmed case, as does 5 of the 6 counties that Fort Berthold overlaps.\n\nlisten live watch live\n\nNorm McCloud, a spokesman for Three Affiliated Tribes Chairman Mark Fox, said Fort Berthold created a 15-member task force to prepare.\n\nAt Standing Rock, Chairman Mike Faith Jr. set up an incident command system.\n\nOn the Sisseton-Wahpeton reservation, the tribal council met Friday to discuss the situation further. The curfew there starts later on the weekends at 11 p.m. Calls to officials there for information after the meeting weren't returned.\n\nOn the Minnesota side, the state's largest reservation \u2014 White Earth \u2014 that covers 1,300 square miles had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, reported Thursday in Mahnomen County. The individual was in self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\nIn a message from Emergency Management Team leader Ed Snetsinger on Facebook, he said the case \"will not be the last and it's why we must continue to practice safe habits like hand washing and staying home per state and tribal orders.\"\n\nHe said they have established a \"one-call center\" at 218-936-2774 to answer general questions about the virus and supportive services such as mental health and nursing care.\n\nThe tribe closed the popular Shooting Star Casinos more than a week ago in Mahnomen and Bagley. However, kitchens were a busy place with workers preparing 1,000 meals a day for tribal elders since Monday.\n\n\"We must come together as a community to slow the impact of COVID-19,\" said Scott Stevens, general manager of Shooting Star Casino, in a statement. \"In times like these, we discover our true strengths. We must help our neighbors. No one is alone.\"\n\nShooting Star Casino and its hotel will remain closed until at least April 1 with employees being compensated throughout the two-week closure.\n\nOn another northern Minnesota reservation, the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians' council this week passed the nighttime curfew for residents for 30 days, with exceptions for people going to and from work and for medical purposes. Those violating the curfew face citations from Red Lake Police Department.\n\nThe tribe said on Friday that they were encouraging residents to stay home. An emergency number was released at 218-679-1119.\n\nMille Lacs Band of Ojibwe Chief Executive Melanie Benjamin signed a stay-at-home executive order this week, with the same rules implemented statewide.

Both items, plus an update by Sarah Reese, Polk County\u2019s public health director, were placed on the City Council\u2019s agenda about 90 minutes before the meeting began at 5 p.m.\n\nCombined, they created a temporary \u201cPolicy Group\u201d comprised of Gander, Council President Mark Olstad, Council Vice President Chad Grassel and several city staffers. That group convened shortly after the council meeting and decided to shut down city hall.

That could, in theory, mean setting up a terminal for that purpose in a public building.\n\nBut that\u2019s apparently not the case in East Grand Forks.

Tuesday, it pushed them to declare an early flood emergency, too.\n\nMayor Steve Gander signed that second declaration on Tuesday, March 24. Almost immediately afterward, City Council members, who called into the meeting remotely to avoid face-to-face exposure to one another, unanimously voted to extend it until the end of the spring flood. Declared flood emergencies are more or less standard in the Grand Cities every spring because they make both cities eligible for state and federal aid.\n\nBut East Grand Forks is notable this year because it\u2019s about two to three weeks ahead of schedule. That, explained City Administrator David Murphy, is because city leaders hope to get started on flood preparation now, rather than sometime in April, in case any city workers are stricken, quarantined or otherwise sidelined by the virus.\n\n\u201cWho knows what\u2019s all going to be happening?\u201d Murphy said.\n\nPublic works employees are already staggering their shifts and have been instructed not to take breaks together.\n\nlisten live watch live\n\nThe declaration isn\u2019t strictly necessary for the city to start gearing up for flood season, but East Grand Forks administrators can point to it -- and the hours crews log while they set up temporary flood walls -- when they ask Minnesota and the feds for reimbursements.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts that the Red River may crest at 46 feet or higher, and city staff and officials on both sides of it have been gearing up for what they\u2019ve called a \u201ctop-five flood.\u201d The river\u2019s flood stage is 28 feet high.\n\nEast Grand Forks City Council members briefly considered capping the extension at 30 days or until floodwaters recede, whichever comes first, but ultimately decided against it by a 4-3 vote. Council member Mark DeMers proposed that idea, saying he is wary of a lengthy emergency period and arguing that the council could meet again to renew the declaration if necessary.\n\n\u201cIf we know we need it for more than 30 days, we should make it for more than 30 days,\u201d Mayor Steve Gander said of the declaration.\n\nAs a public service, the Herald has opened this article to everyone regardless of subscription status.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":8631.0,"lat":47.9284,"lng":-97.0138}

Part of the Governor's announcement Sunday called for all Minnesota K-12 schools to close by Wednesday, March 18, 2020 through March 27th.\n\nDienst says the order for closure of schools is one of the reasons the city decided to hold their special meeting when they did. With any closure the library usually sees an increase in patrons so to limit exposure Buckham Memorial Library closed today and will be through March 31st.\n\nAdditionally library staff will be on site and can be reached by phone or email to assist with digital offerings available on the library website.

We start out in the containment phase, which we were in until about last week. Where we try to contain it and stop it that way. Once we decide or have learned that's not feasible then we move into the community mitigation phase which we are in now. It means because of the word community being in there it involves everybody.

It unanimously approved extending its Declaration of Emergency beyond the customary three days until a time yet to be determined.\n\nThis city declaration comes after national and state action on March 13, including President Donald Trump declaring the COVID-19 outbreak as a National Emergency and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz declaring a Peacetime State of Emergency to provide \u201call necessary resources\u201d to support a response to COVID-19.\n\nGreenbush and Roseau County have not yet had any confirmed cases of CO-VID-19, also known as the coronavirus, but, according to its declaration, the city is preparing for its \u201cinevitable spread\u201d to this region. According to its declaration, the city personnel started preparing for this virus weeks ago, including working with local, state, and federal partners. On March 23, Greenbush Mayor Brenda Sather and City Clerk Anita Locken sat in on meetings with the county and League of Minnesota Cities.\n\nStarting on March 23, all city facilities were closed until a time yet to be determined, including the city office, community center, fire station, skating rink, and public works shop.\n\nAs for the community center, during the March 16 regular city meeting, Locken said all but two meetings had been canceled in the community center at that point. According to notice provided by the city, those still scheduled to use the center will be left on the calendar just in case the center would open on time for their event.\n\nAs for the city office, Locken will work from home, but people can still reach her at her city office phone number (218-782-2570) and email ([email protected]). Every Monday and Friday, Locken will pick up mail and bills and do necessary banking.\n\nPeople can still drop off their payments at the utility drop box outside the city office. They can also mail in their payments to PO Box 98, or sign up for online payments through the city website. People also can contact the city to make a credit card payment or to switch to automatic payments through their bank.\n\nFor those individuals and businesses experiencing difficulties paying their utility bill during this time, they should contact the city office. The city will not enforce any late utility fees for these businesses or individuals. Also, Locken will credit individuals for high water usage due to a water meter issue and the city won\u2019t check on water meters until the pandemic ends.\n\nThe Fire Department will continue to respond to calls and Public Works will continue to work, but in a limited capacity to provide \u201cessential services.\u201d\n\nThe city also approved some temporary policies for its employees. It wants its employees to watch for the following symptoms (persistent cough, runny nose, sore throat, shortness of breath, fever, vomiting, diarrhea) and if they have these symptoms to stay home. The city also is asking its employees to notify them immediately if they contact someone with COVID-19.\n\nSeveral of these policies impact the Public Works Department specifically. For example, unless one is experiencing a utility emergency, the city is recommending that city employees do not enter personal residences. People are encouraged to contact the city shop by phone (218-782-2941), email ([email protected]), or through the \u201ccitizen engagement\u201d on the city website.\n\nPublic Works is also being asked to have one person in a vehicle, as part of the CDC and Minnesota Department of Health\u2019s social distancing recommendation of six feet.\n\nIn case the Public Works is unable to perform its duties, several council members would be able to assist, including Shaun Walsh and Eric Etherington.

The city has closed the office to the public at this time as well as the community center. The mayor and council have declared a city emergency and will be having a series of phone calls to help plan for the COVID-19 response.\n\nThe emergency declaration states that the closeness of in-person meetings of the city council and other advisory committees, boards and commissions of the city of Starbuck are not practical or prudent due to the COVID-19 health pandemic and the peacetime emergency declared by Governor Tim Walz. The declaration states that after March 18, 2020, such meetings shall be conducted by telephone or other electronic means unless social distancing of a least six feet between each person can be achieved. The declaration also directs city staff to take action to enable such meetings to occur.\n\nResidents can pay their utility bills by mail at PO Box 606, Starbuck MN 56381 or leave payments in the drop box at the city office front door.\n\nLaw enforcement\n\ncontinues work, service\n\nCounty Sheriff\u2019s Office, police release information for public\n\nThe Pope County Sheriff\u2019s Office along with the Glenwood and Starbuck Police Departments last Thursday released the following news release.\n\n\u201cThe Pope County Sheriff\u2019s Office, the Glenwood and Starbuck Police Departments are informing the public that our law enforcement agencies are actively working close with area partners in response to the COVID-19,\u201d it was announced in a press release dated Thursday, March 19.\n\n\u201cWe would like to inform the public that in response to the COVID-19 law enforcement agencies in Pope County, Minnesota have implemented the following protocols:\n\nNon-Emergency calls-for-service\n\n\u201cAll non-emergency calls for service will be handled over the phone to avoid face-to-face contact with citizens, and to comply with the social distancing guidelines and avoid the possibility of contaminating officers with COVID-19 virus or other medical illnesses.\n\n\u201cOur law enforcement agencies are also trying to limit the public from reporting non-emergency calls at our office locations. If you need to report any NON-EMERGENCY calls-for-service please contact Pope County Sheriff\u2019s Office dispatch at 320-634-5411 or 320-239-2311.\n\n\u201cExamples of Non-Emergency Calls-for-Service: Any calls that are not an immediate risk to public safety; such as civil issue calls, tenant and landlord issues, verbal or social media harassment complaints, thefts, vehicle break-ins, animal complaints, parking complaints, scam calls, any general law enforcement questions or concerns, suspicious activity, etc.\u201d\n\nEmergency calls-for-service\n\nLaw enforcement will respond to all emergency calls-for-service and calls that pose a risk or immediate threat to the public safety.\n\nAs far as patrols and other law enforcement, duties will continue as usual, and all officers have been advised of safety precautions regarding COVID-19. Any officer who starts having symptoms of the COVID-19 virus or those who have been exposed to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19 will notify their supervisor to follow agency protocol for these types of incidents.\n\nOverall, law enforcement\u2019s primary goal is to keep the public, as well as law enforcement officers, safe during this global pandemic.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":1253.0,"lat":45.6121,"lng":-95.5333}

That same day, the San Francisco bank\u2019s head of consumer lending, Mary Mack, told employees in her division, in an email obtained by VICE, that the \u201cbranch, contact center, and operations center employees are considered \u2018essential\u2019 and exempt from the counties\u2019 orders.\u201d\n\nVICE spoke with 11 current or recently departed Wells Fargo employees in six different states about the mandate. While banks have qualified under California and other states\u2019 definition of \u201cessential services,\u201d Wells Fargo employees who work at the call centers, in complaints departments, and in collections have questioned whether that should include their jobs. The employees\u2014who requested to withhold their names out of fear of reprisal\u2014said they feared they might be exposing themselves and others to the highly contagious virus but felt pressure to go to work at Wells Fargo\u2019s offices, which they described as crowded. The employees hold some of the lowest-paid jobs at the country\u2019s fourth-largest bank. Often, they work under contractor or temporary status.\n\nThose among them who have expressed their concerns with superiors have largely felt dismissed or ignored, they said.\n\n\u201cThey refuse to let anyone work from home in our department,\u201d said one call-center employee in Wells Fargo\u2019s downtown Des Moines offices. \u201cI have about 250 people on my floor. I'm terrified that I am going to get COVID-19 because of their greed.\u201d\n\nDo you have a coronavirus story you want to tell? Fill out this form or reach out on Signal at (310) 614-3752 and VICE will be in touch.\n\nConcerned Wells Fargo employees at call centers and complaint departments said they have tried to voice their concerns by speaking to their direct supervisor or turning to human resources about what they fear are unsafe working conditions, only to receive responses they feel are dismissive of the severity of the outbreak. After an employee in the complaint department at a corporate campus in West Des Moines, Iowa, expressed concern about the lack of safety measures taken in the workplace, his manager responded by saying that questions about negligence or safety concerns were simultaneously \u201cinaccurate\" and \"inappropriate,\u201d according to a screenshot of a text shared with VICE. Another employee who works with approximately 200 people in Phoenix, Arizona, said her manager mocked her concerns.\n\n\u201cMy manager laughed when I asked if we would be sent home with\/without pay or if there was a work from home option,\u201d she said.\n\nAs of Monday, cars still filled the parking lot at Wells Fargo's corporate campus in West Des Moines, Iowa. (Photo obtained by Aaron Calvin)\n\nWells Fargo did not deny the primary claims put forth in this article, instead arguing that the unprecedented nature of the coronavirus pandemic and government regulations have made it difficult for large-scale businesses like it to respond. Nevertheless, a company spokesperson said it has expanded benefits and will continue to take more steps to protect employees.\n\n\u201cThe health and safety of our employees is top priority,\u201d the spokesperson said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will continue to thoughtfully evaluate the needs of our employees as the situation evolves, and we will make changes as shifting circumstances demand.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson insisted that the company is working to allow as many of its employees to work from home as possible. \u201cHowever, not all jobs can be done from home,\u201d the company said. As of now, Wells Fargo is \u201cexploring innovative ways to allow some contact center employees to work from home, while adhering to regulations requiring that contact center lines be recorded.\u201d But Mack, the head of consumer lending, added in a phone interview with VICE that the company was receiving calls from concerned customers in certain business segments at an unprecedented rate, which, the company decided, made the role of employees at call centers and complaint departments critical right now.\n\n\u201cMy manager laughed when I asked if we would be sent home with\/without pay or if there was a work from home option.\"\n\nThe situation has created an increasingly tense environment at multiple offices. The employee in the West Des Moines complaint department said employees were worried about their own health, and managers had insinuated that concerns related to the pandemic were overblown. The employee said he witnessed instances of employees stealing wipes that others had brought from home.\n\n\u201cMy concern is getting sick, or being sick and spreading it to everyone. We have old people and compromised people in a lot of places,\u201d he added.\n\nIn response to such concerns, Wells Fargo said that it has undertaken \u201csocial distancing measures\u201d to ensure the safety of in-office employees, including staggering shifts and rearranging its call centers to ensure that \u201cthe majority of desks are six feet apart.\u201d The company also said it has implemented \u201can enhanced cleaning program\u201d and sent sanitizing wipes and hand sanitizer stations to its branches, operations centers, and contact centers.\n\nBut many of the employees said the company\u2019s internal response has largely felt insufficient. One employee in the Wells Fargo\u2019s collections department in Phoenix, Arizona, called the company\u2019s claim that it had improved cleaning efforts \u201cbullshit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI 100% feel unsafe,\u201d the employee wrote to VICE. \u201cI\u2019ve had the same trash bag in my trash can since LAST Monday. How I know, I have kept a tally mark on the bag for every day it\u2019s stayed unchanged.\u201d\n\nThe employee in the West Des Moines complaints department agreed: \u201cWe sit within three to five feet of each other with low walls separating. \u2018Enhanced cleaning\u2019 does not appear to be in effect. Many of us have remarked that we see cleaning services less than usual.\u201d\n\n\"My concern is getting sick, or being sick and spreading it to everyone. We have old people, and compromised people in a lot of places\"\n\nTo reduce the threat of coronavirus in its offices, Wells Fargo will allow certain people to take time off with pay without using their vacation days. This includes those diagnosed with COVID-19, those being tested for COVID-19, and those being advised to self-isolate because of potential exposure. Employees with a health condition that puts them at \u201chigh risk as defined by the CDC\u201d are eligible for up to 14 days away from work as well.\n\nSome states, like New York, have argued that testing should only be for those with severe symptoms, which could create a more complicated situation for Wells Fargo employees who suspect they have COVID-19 but aren\u2019t displaying symptoms, haven\u2019t verifiably come into contact with the coronavirus, aren\u2019t in a risk group and cannot obtain a test. They must use paid time off to avoid going into work, and only a positive test will earn it back, according to the company\u2019s policy as laid out to VICE.\n\nWells Fargo said other employees who are experiencing more general \u201cworry, nervousness, or anxiety\u201d are free to \u201cuse their PTO if they feel unable to work.\u201d Mack, Wells Fargo\u2019s head of consumer lending, added that these uncomfortable employees could additionally take unpaid time off work and would not be penalized due to their absence.\n\n\"I 100% feel unsafe.\"\n\nMultiple call center employees said many of their co-workers have already decided to go ahead and do so. Others described more troublesome experiences, in which they felt pressure to remain at work or return to it in ways that appeared at odds with Mack\u2019s assertion. One Wells Fargo employee at a densely populated corporate campus in San Antonio, Texas, left work for a time period because she was worried about what it would mean for her mother, who is in remission from cancer and immunocompromised. On Friday, she was told to return to work or risk being fired, she said. When a temporary employee at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage in Minneapolis, Minnesota, stopped coming into work to avoid the dense environment, he was let go from the company, he said.\n\n\u201cAny contention that employees are being threatened with termination because they are requesting time off is wholly inconsistent with the guidance that has been provided to managers,\u201d Wells Fargo said in its statement. \u201cIndividual internal notes do not comprehensively reflect the thoughtful and evolving steps we are taking to support our employees.\u201d\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread, Wells Fargo told VICE that the company has been asking employees for \u201cfeedback so that we can address any concerns quickly and fully\u201d and develop \u201ccreative solutions to problems never faced before,\u201d which have so far included a $100 per day reimbursement for hourly employees who need childcare in order to work.\n\nWells Fargo\u2019s retail bank employees received some relief last week after the bank decided to close most of its bank lobbies and switch to drive-thru service only, closing some branches entirely and reassigning some of its employees to other branches. Before then, retail bank employees said they feared unnecessary contact with customers who carried the virus. One employee at a bank in Tennessee claimed that he and his co-workers were so anxious before the opening of their bank last Thursday that they gathered for prayer beforehand.\n\n\u201cI've casually spoken with a few people about quitting. We entertained the idea, but we're all stuck. We need our jobs\"\n\nThe situation has left other types of employees struggling with what to do. \u201cI've casually spoken with a few people about quitting,\u201d said the employee in the West Des Moines complaints department. \u201cWe entertained the idea, but we're all stuck. We need our jobs.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, after VICE reached out to Wells Fargo about employee concerns, the company announced internally that it had decided to hand out one-time cash payments to employees making less than $100,000. \u201cThis award recognizes how hard employees are working on our journey to transform Wells Fargo and reflects our commitment to take care of those that need our help the most,\u201d the company said. The company will give eligible full-time employees $600 before taxes. Part-time employees get $300.\n\nAdditionally, the company said that \u201cemployees on the front line\u201d who make less than $100,000 and \u201cwhose roles require they come in to the office [sic]\u201d amid a global pandemic will receive a temporary pay bump. Starting in the second half of April, eligible employees will receive additional $200 per paycheck for five pay periods.\n\n\u201cDuring this global public health emergency, we are especially grateful to those of you who continue to come in to our branches, contact centers, and other offices to serve customers and colleagues. It is more important than ever that we keep providing essential banking and financial services to the public,\u201d the company said. \u201cAnd we appreciate how our employees continue to answer the call.\u201d\n\nIn the same email, Wells Fargo announced that it had decided not to make a profit-sharing contribution to employee 401(k) plans for 2019, citing a combination of the company\u2019s financial performance last year and \u201cthe extraordinary environment we are currently living through.\u201d The company made $2.9 billion in net income in the final quarter of last year.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.","category":"None","population":2195.0,"lat":43.7432,"lng":-93.7278}

Reach out to family or a senior citizen that lives near you and ask if they need help,\" Calvin said. \"Together we as a community can do this, we can make a positive impact on our community.\"\n\nThe local emergency will stay in place until the council votes to cancel it. The declaration gives city staff leeway and flexibility to implement new plans and procedures to keep the city working. City staff will be working on those plans and procedures in the coming days.\n\n\"It clarifies and perhaps adds legal standing to some of these unconventional and unusual measures city staff are going to have to take to respond to the current situations, and the fact these responses are likely to be required before staff can bring them to the council for consideration and approval,\" said City Attorney Robert Scott.\n\nCalvin said the city won't be operating in a vacuum and the council would be kept abreast of what was being done. The emergency declaration just allows things to move a bit faster.\n\n\"We don't want to hold the city staff back from making good and prudent decisions,\" Calvin said.\n\nThe city is already taking steps to limit the risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus. The city is limiting out-of-state travel for employees, asking employees to self-quarantine if they traveled to a country on the Centers for Disease Control list of high-risk countries and requesting that citizens not enter city buildings if they have traveled internationally in the prior 12 days. Access to city buildings will be limited and citizens are asked to call the city at 320-235-4913 before visiting any such structure.\n\n\"Our staff is willing and eager to help you and assist you in any way possible,\" Calvin said.\n\nThe declaration also makes clear that holding in-person meetings, whether it's the council, committees or the Planning Commission, would not be practical in the current climate. Going forward, the city will be looking for other ways to hold meetings, including by telephone or by other electronic means, which is allowed by state law during a health pandemic or during a declared state emergency.\n\nCalvin has also requested that all non-essential meetings for the next 14 days be canceled.\n\n\"This would include the work session on March 30,\" Calvin said.\n\nCalvin asked everyone to follow the simple health rules national and state leaders and medical officials have been pushing for weeks, including washing your hands, coughing into your sleeve and staying home if you are sick.\n\n\"We need you to stay home if you are ill,\" Calvin said.\n\nHe also requests everyone practice social distancing, to stay home as much as possible, and when you do need to go out, to keep at least six feet between you and another person.\n\n\"My wife, Ginna, and I are choosing to self-distance ourselves from others, and I am asking you and your family to do the same,\" Calvin said. \"It is not in our Minnesota DNA, but it will take all of us to halt and spread the curve of this pandemic and flatten the curve. That is our goal.\"\n\nThe council unanimously agreed to the emergency declaration and supports what city staff has been doing already.\n\n\"I think this is a very important step for us to take. It just says to the residents of our community that we respect them, we appreciate them and we want to keep them safe,\" Councilor Kathy Schwantes said. \"We are all in this together.

It enables the city to bypass time-intensive procedures that involve spending public funds, including allowing purchasing without bidding, getting rid of tax levy limitations and loosening other budget requirements.\n\n\"At this point in time, we don't know the full width and breadth and length and depth of this whole situation, and it's a good action by the city to join other cities in declaring this emergency so that the full powers and flexibilities that are allowed under state statute are available to the city of Woodbury,\" City Administrator Clint Gridley said during the meeting.\n\nThe federal government has also taken action to create opportunities for cities to be reimbursed on costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the city wants to ensure it will be eligible for federal or state funds, Gridley said.\n\nAfter the declaration, the council passed a separate resolution authorizing the actions laid out in the declaration and continuing the state of local emergency until further action is taken by the council.\n\nThe council is considering holding future meetings, including the next meeting scheduled for 7:30 p.m. April 8, virtually and continuing to broadcast them live on YouTube. Council workshops, while open to the public, are not normally broadcast but will be temporarily, said Jason Egerstrom, the city's communication manager. City hall is still open to the public during council meetings.\n\nCity buildings have been closed to the public since March 19, and Washington County issued a separate emergency declaration March 17.\n\nThe local emergency declared Jan. 8 to help speed up water treatment efforts related to PFAS contamination is ongoing.\n\nAs a public service, we've opened this article to everyone regardless of subscription status.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":69756.0,"lat":44.9056,"lng":-92.923}

Ginther left little doubt what the future holds, saying it is \"when and not if\" the virus cases start showing up. The state estimated yesterday that the number of cases would double every six days until late April to mid-May, when it may peak and start heading down again.\n\nThe city of Columbus\u2019 five-member Board of Health voted Friday to declare a citywide health emergency related to the coronavirus that under state laws will give city Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts sweeping powers to fight the outbreak.\n\nLocal health departments have extensive power in emergencies to quarantine people, use police and deputize \"quarantine guards\" with police power to enforce their efforts if people don\u2019t cooperate, force people to undergo examinations, and other powers designed \"for the prevention of contagious or infectious disease,\" Ohio law says.\n\nTo Roberts\u2019 knowledge, this has never been done in Columbus history, she said at a briefing today with Mayor Andrew J. Ginther. She emphasized that the department has no current plans to use these powers, \"but we will do whatever it takes,\" Roberts said.\n\nWhile the two repeated that the city still has no \"confirmed cases,\" a national testing logjam led the state health director Thursday to discuss \"estimated\" cases rather than confirmed cases, putting the current statewide estimate of coronavirus infection at 100,000 Ohioans.\n\n>> This story is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. You can find more stories on coronavirus here. Please support local journalism by subscribing to The Columbus Dispatch at subscribe.dispatch.com.\n\nRoberts gave no estimate for Columbus, preferring to rely on actual test results that she said would be ramping up significantly at local hospitals by next week.\n\n\"Because we started ramping up testing here in our community as of Monday, with our local providers able to test, I am optimistic that we\u2019ll get some indication what the circulation of this virus is in our community,\" Roberts said.\n\nCurrently, said she there are 24 test results pending, and one that came back negative.\n\n>> Read more: Coronavirus reaches Ohio: Here\u2019s what we know about closings, latest updates\n\nBut Ginther left little doubt what the future holds, saying it is \"when and not if\" the virus cases start showing up. The state estimated yesterday that the number of cases would double every six days until late April to mid-May, when it may peak and start heading down again.\n\nBut Roberts said that, unlike the flu, the \"novel,\" or new, virus is not fully understood, and therefore health care workers are in uncharted waters, calling these \"unprecedented times.\"\n\nThe city health emergency will build on an order signed Thursday by state Department of Health Dr. Director Amy Acton that shutters all K-12 schools statewide for three weeks, at which point the situation will be reassessed.\n\nActon\u2019s order also bans most gatherings of over 100 people, with certain exceptions such as for religious services.\n\nWhile the state order closes down all K-12 schools, adding to colleges that had already shut down or moved to online instruction, the only piece of the school system being allowed by authorities to remain open will be preschools, though many are closing anyway. Columbus City Schools said Thursday all its pre-K units were closing at the end of Friday for three weeks.\n\nAsked what is the logic of closing everything but schools serving infants and toddlers, Roberts said she doesn\u2019t know the rationale. \"I was not a part of those conversations,\" Roberts said.\n\nColumbus Public Health has authority over the cities of Columbus and Worthington.\n\n\"We are preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best,\" Roberts said.\n\nbbush@dispatch.com\n\n@ReporterBush","category":"state_of_emergency","population":31701.0,"lat":33.5088,"lng":-88.4097}

File photo\n\nFor more news about the COVID-19 coronavirus, access the News Tribune Health section.\n\nHOLTS SUMMIT \u2014 Holts Summit is the first Callaway County municipality to declare a state of emergency over COVID-19.\n\nThe declaration, signed by Mayor Landon Oxley, is dated Tuesday but was publicly released Thursday. City aldermen discussed plans to grant the mayor emergency powers during Tuesday's board meeting.\n\n\"The proclamation of a state of emergency provides the City of Holts Summit the ability to take measures to reduce the possibility of exposure to disease, control the risk and promote the health and safety of Holts Summit residents,\" the declaration reads. \"The city wishes to employ all means available under the law to protect public life, health, safety and property to limit the development, contraction and spread of COVID-19 creating this emergency.\"\n\nThe declaration cites the World Health Organization's decision to label COVID-19 a global pandemic and Gov. Mike Parson's decision to declare a state of emergency for Missouri as contributing factors, among others.\n\nHolts Summit's city code allows city government to do certain things in a state of emergency, beyond its usual powers. These include, as listed by the declaration:\n\nThe power to use employees of the city to assist in the preservation of life, limb and property.\n\nTo close streets and sidewalks to the use of the public.\n\nTo impose emergency curfew regulations.\n\nTo close business establishments.\n\nTo close any city-owned buildings and other facilities to the general public.\n\nTo reassign all administrative and executive employees doing non-administrative work as non-administrative or non-exempt employees during the declared disaster.\n\nTo expend funds, make contracts, obtain and distribute supplies and equipment for emergency preparedness; provide for the health and safety of persons and property; and direct and coordinate the development of disaster plans and programs.\n\nTo appoint, provide or remove rescue teams, auxiliary fire and police personnel, etc.\n\nWith the approval of the state governor, to enter into mutual-aid agreements with other public and private agencies for reciprocal emergency aid.\n\nTo accept services, materials, equipment, supplies or funds granted or loaned by the federal government for disaster planning and operation purposes.\n\nCity officials clarified via Facebook that Oxley is not acting on the vast majority of these powers at this time. So far, Holts Summit has closed the City Hall lobby, park, baseball and softball fields, and civic center. The city has also postponed its annual Easter egg hunt and asked citizens not to congregate in groups of 50 or more.\n\nThe declaration also calls upon the county, state and federal authorities to provide assistance.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":3830.0,"lat":38.6452,"lng":-92.1151}

What we\u2019re trying to say is how can we make sure that we don\u2019t see a significant impact before we can handle it here in Kansas City,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nIn a statement posted to Twitter, Lucas wrote that \"all events with more than 1,000 attendees within the city are canceled or delayed until the emergency has been lifted.\"\n\nSoon after, officials with the Big 12 conference canceled the men's and women's basketball tournaments in downtown Kansas City.\n\nIn a press conference later, Lucas said he understands frustration over not being able to attend sporting events, concerts or other large gatherings.\n\n\u201cTrust me, we are in the business of collecting tax revenues and that sort of thing, so we don\u2019t come to these decisions lightly. But we understand that it\u2019s vital that we take an important leadership position on prevention,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nLucas has also put a moratorium on all \"non-essential travel for City employees until the emergency has been lifted.\"\n\nAs of Thursday, schools in Kansas City remain open. Churches with large congregations are encouraged to use their discretion on whether to cancel services. Private businesses with offices of 1000-plus people are not affected by the ban on large events.\n\nKansas City, Missouri, currently has no confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but health officials say spread to Kansas City is inevitable.\n\n\"We're working diligently across departments to prevent potential spread \u2014 and we're asking our community members and business owners to do their part in helping to prevent potential spread,\" Lucas said.\n\nDr. Rex Archer, director of the Kansas City Health Department says the city has tested fewer than a dozen people for the virus and none have tested presumptive positive.\n\nStill, Archer told reporters Thursday he believes it is likely that there are already mild, undiagnosed cases in Kansas City. He\u2019s encouraging people not to shake hands and even discourages fist-bumps and elbow taps, as bacteria can still be transferred.\n\n\u201cThink about just greeting people with the hand over the heart or a namaste. We need to break this cycle to keep this virus from moving around,\u201d Archer said.\n\nUnder a state of emergency, the city has the power to enact a curfew, bar the sale of liquor or close businesses, but Lucas said he has no plans to take any of those measures at this point.\n\nKansas City buses and Kansas City International Airport remain open.\n\n\"Protecting all of our residents remains our top priority, which means that how we interact over the weeks and months ahead will need to change dramatically as we confront our current public health challenge,\" Lucas said. \"I appreciate our community's understanding during this ever-changing time and encourage all residents to continue exercising good judgment.\"\n\nArcher said that the precautions the city took Thursday will help prevent the spread of the virus, but they will not protect the most vulnerable people from contracting it.\n\nStill, Lucas said people who are young and healthy do not need to avoid gathering in groups.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a mass quarantine or the area,\u201d Lucas said.\n\nIndependence Mayor Eileen Weir also declared a state of emergency in her city Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe have detailed emergency plans in place for each of our departments and with this declaration these emergency operation plans have been activated,\" Weir said. \"We will make a detailed announcement tomorrow with the changes citizens and the public will see to City services and operations.\u201d\n\nLate Thursday afternoon, Jackson County Executive Frank White, Jr., announced that the Kansas City state of emergency would expand to all of Jackson County. The executive order calls for no large group events of 1,000 or more people and applies to all of Jackson County except for the City of Kansas City.\n\n\"We will continue to closely monitor the situation in collaboration with local, regional and national health experts, who will help guide our response to this quickly changing situation,\" White said.\n\nLisa Rodriguez is KCUR's afternoon newscaster and City Hall reporter.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":117306.0,"lat":39.0871,"lng":-94.3503}

And those decisions have to be made not just based on one\u2019s own health, but in really thinking about the health of our entire community. If we can get everyone thinking and acting on those terms, we stand a much better chance of making it through this as safe as possible.\"\n\nIn effect now, the City is encouraging the cancelation of all gatherings of 25 or more people, and that any event adhere to social distancing guidelines.\n\nAlong with the declaration was an ordinance that frees up many offices to act quickly for whenever the virus appears in the community. City Manager Mari Macomber and her office can make immediate purchases of emergency supplies when needed.\n\nAlso, Lacy King, the city Finance Director, can work with citizens on a case-by-case basis if they are financially impacted by the virus. That means penalties and fees can be waived for paying bills and halting utility shutoffs for 30 days.\n\n\"We want people to continue to be able to take care of their needs and services as best as they can,\" Burden said. \"This isn\u2019t saying you don\u2019t have to pay your water bill for a month. \u2026 If there are extenuating circumstances, let\u2019s make sure we have some opportunities for you.\"\n\nGov. Mike Parson was in Kirksville Tuesday to meet with Burden and other city officials to discuss efforts to fight the virus. Since that meeting and others across the state, Parson has left many decisions up to local government. With that in mind, the declaration asks to prohibit gatherings of 10 or more people, and to limit businesses (other than essential ones like hospitals and grocery stores) to half of its maximum occupancy and no more than 50 people. But the city needs authorization from either the Adair County Health Department or the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which hasn\u2019t happened.\n\nBurden knows \"state of emergency\" sounds scary, but said there isn\u2019t any more immediate danger today than two days ago. Mainly it\u2019s a strong statement that Kirksville is taking the coronavirus seriously.\n\n\"The word \u2018emergency\u2019 is a pointed one, right? I think folks should heed it, but be careful of what it says,\" Burden said. \"They should heed it because it\u2019s really letting everyone in our community know that this is a serious situation, and we have a need to take this seriously. But by declaring emergency today, we don\u2019t say that anything has changed from yesterday or the day before, as far as concerns for safety. It\u2019s acknowledging there\u2019s an existing concern and we have to address it.\"\n\nBurden asks citizens to stay tuned to the city\u2019s social media channels for direct communications from local officials. A page has been added to the city\u2019s website (kirksvillecity.com\/covid-19) specifically for the coronavirus.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":15942.0,"lat":40.1986,"lng":-92.5753}

Not today. Not tomorrow,\" she said. \"If it happens it will be done in a coherent and orderly way.

People need to be separated and fed, she said, and more details on how the city plans to do that will be released this weekend.\n\nDrouin said 46 per cent of the positive COVID-19 cases on the island of Montreal are related to travelling, but the coronavirus is spreading in the community, more in certain neighbourhoods than in others.\n\nShe said spread of COVID-19 will continue to rise rapidly on the island in the coming days, stressing that people must continue isolating themselves.\n\n\"It's not just one neighbourhood.

While there are only 12 confirmed cases (see below)in Montana (none in Cascade County) at the moment, the national trend is moving toward Montana. Two other local jurisdictions have declared similar emergencies: the Cascade City-County Health Department and Malmstrom Air Force Base.\n\nTrisha Gardner, the health officer of the City-County Health Department, said that all restaurants in Cascade County will be limited to drive-through, take-out, delivery, and curb-side service only, effective at 6 a.m. on Friday, March 20. The order extends until Friday, March 27, and could be extended. Other businesses ordered to close for the duration of the emergency order include casinos, gyms\/fitness centers, bowling alleys, coffee bars, movie theatres, and \"other commercial businesses in which people assemble for recreation.\"\n\nCity Manager Greg Doyon said parking meter enforcement in downtown Great Falls will be suspended for the duration of the emergency order.\n\nMayor Bob Kelly said that the decision to declare a state of emergency was unanimously approved by all five city commissioners, adding that the decision was not made lightly.\n\nKelly also said that people who want to help the community can do so in several ways. He said the Great Falls Public School District is working to help students across the community; click here to visit the GFPS website to find out how you can help.\n\nHe said that the United Way of Cascade County is coordinating volunteers and accepting donations to help people who are being directly affected by the crisis. The United Way website states:\n\nUnited Way of Cascade County has created a COVID-19 Community Response and Recovery fund to support local organizations who are seeing an increased demand on their services. One-hundred percent of the funds donated will be allocated to support service organizations as they address ongoing and new needs within our community. Our initial distributions will focus on adding capacity to the 211 network so they may continue to provide vital information about COVID-19 and community resources, take the burden off healthcare providers and public health officials, and, importantly, capture community-level data that can help us determine where needs are most urgent. Once community-level needs have been determined, distributions will focus on supporting the needs of working families, starting with partners which provide individual assistance with things like rent, utilities, food and more. To donate click here or send checks to United Way, PO Box 1343, Great Falls, MT, 59403. Local help with childcare, food, energy assistance, unemployment assistance, and more is available. People can call the community help resource line 2-1-1 or search www.montana211.org to find resources that fit their needs.\n\nOnce affirmed by the City Commission, the declaration gives the City Manager additional authority to protect the public from the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The declaration also authorizes the City Manager to enact temporary measure to provide relief where appropriate of city process, operations, ordinances. Finally,the order grants the City Manager authority to make sure that the City is being resourced properly so it may continue to provide essential services. The order will not necessarily free up any additional funding for the City because the President and the Governor have already declared emergencies.\n\nThe news release says that many extraordinary steps have been taken already by local businesses, nonprofits, agencies and authorities \u2013 school closures, event postponement, establishments limiting public access, restaurants providing delivery only, and the City reducing or eliminating certain non-essential services. While we are all taking extraordinary steps to slow the virus down, more action may be necessary to protect Great Falls citizens.\n\nFor more information about the City of Great Falls\u2019 COVID-19 proactive measures, contact the Communications Division at 406-455-8496.\n\nThere are now 11 confirmed COVID-19 patients in the state of Montana.

Reeves said that a person on base was recently in close contact with a person who is confirmed to have COVID-19; she said that the Malmstrom person has been tested, and they are waiting for results from a state lab in Helena. She stressed that at this point, the Malmstrom person has NOT been confirmed to have COVID-19.\n\nReeves says the declaration will provide Malmstrom with \"the tools necessary to protect our Airmen and their families and limit the spread of this virus,\" and added, \u201cThe risk to the base population remains low, but it still exists and that\u2019s why preventive measures such as washing hands frequently and practicing good hygiene are critical to the success of our efforts at protection.\"\n\nDeclaring a public health emergency enables base leaders to take actions that promote force protection, such as closing base facilities, limiting non-mission essential activities, restricting movement, or implementing quarantine or isolation for select individuals. The declaration is in effect for 30 days unless otherwise terminated or extended.\n\n\u201cForce health protection is our top priority, and we will continue to ensure that Air Force personnel have the most up-to-date information on appropriate measures to prevent potential spread of the virus.

We talked with officials at Malmstrom who stated that there are zero confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Malmstrom, and there have not been any quarantines or lockdowns. They also said: \"Team Malmstrom leadership is continually monitoring the situation and working closely with the Montana Department of Health to coordinate prevention and response efforts in the local area. We are providing installation personnel and their families with up-to-date information on appropriate measures to prevent potential spread of the virus, as well as any impact to local activities. Our mission is a continuous one and we are prepared to continue to meet and exceed our mission objectives. Some changes we\u2019ve executed are changes to gate procedures as well as single-point entry procedures at the clinic.\"\n\nMalmstrom did implement a change on Thursday affecting all visitors to the base. Security Forces personnel at the entrance gates will no longer be touching ID cards of people coming on base. Malmstrom said in a Facebook post: \"As you come up to the installation gates, you will need to show the Defender the front side of your card, then, when prompted, turn it around so the back side can be scanned and\/or looked at. Once your card is scanned, follow the directions from the Defender. DO NOT proceed through the gate until you are directed to by the Defender so as not to cause confusion or initiate any other actions on the Defender\u2019s part.

Benefis is restricting visitors as a precautionary measure to their senior services facilities, including Grandview, Westview, Eastview, and Assisted Living.\n\nWe have received messages from people saying that some nursing homes in Great Falls have implemented restrictions on visitors because their residents are a higher-risk population due to their age and medical conditions.

Students presently on Spring Break will be told not to return to campus this weekend.\"\n\nThe only confirmed Montana case is a Lake County woman who is currently in Maryland. Health officials in Maryland say the woman was last in Montana in November 2019, has not returned to the state since that time, and was not in Montana during the 14-day incubation period. Despite the fact that the woman is not in Montana currently and has not been in Montana since she was exposed and tested positive, current guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) mandate that her case is considered to be a \"Montana\" case.

We hope sooner than later and we can get life back to normal for everyone.\u201d\n\nA press release stated the closures include city hall, the city auditorium, the Carnegie building, library, senior center, indoor batting facility, restrooms, ball fields, playgrounds and recreational facilities until further notice.\n\nBeatrice Police Capt. Gerald Lamkin asked the public comply with the declaration and not be in the parks.\n\n\u201cIf people are in the parks during our patrol maneuvers we\u2019ll be reminding that individual that the parks are closed until further notice and then just standby until they leave,\u201d he said. \u201cWe certainly don\u2019t want to get to the point where we cite people for that, but common sense has got to be the key here. People just need to do their part and help the city do its part to keep everybody save.\u201d\n\nIf someone refuses to comply, Lamkin said he or she could be ticketed for trespassing.\n\nWith area schools being out until at least the end of the month, Lamkin is asking parents or guardians to be especially aware of where their children are at.\n\n\u00d7 Help support our COVID-19 coverage We're providing access to COVID-19 articles for free.

It\u2019s going to be up to the adults to monitor their own children and families. Don\u2019t leave it up to the government to handle everything.\u201d\n\nAbsent from the press release listing closures was the trail system, which Tempelmeyer said is a gray area.\n\n\u201cThe hard part is you can\u2019t keep people off the trails any more than the sidewalk,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we want to do is encourage everyone to have some common sense and practice social distancing. You usually don\u2019t see large groups running down trail at one time. If you\u2019re running on the trail we\u2019re not going to cite you or ticket you.\u201d\n\nThe city is working with citizens to conduct as much business as possible by phone or via the website at www.beatrice.ne.gov and citizens are encouraged to pay their utility bills online, by phone, mail, or drop box.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Tempelmeyer said all city workers were still maintaining a regular work schedule.\n\nCity departments that have to continue working with the public, like the police department, are asking for cooperation in trying to do more business over the phone.\n\n\u201cWe are probably taking more property crimes over the phone, more civil calls, things of that nature,\u201d Lamkin said. \u201cWe really don\u2019t like doing that, but we\u2019re forced to take measures to keep officers safe and healthy, as well. I would encourage people if they have property crimes, something stolen or damaged, to simply call in rather than come in and file a report.\u201d\n\nWhile at this time there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Gage County, the local disaster declaration assists in the availability of emergency supplies to the city, if they are needed.\n\nThe local Unified Command Center continues to monitor and prepare for the potential spread of the COVID-19 virus in our community.\n\nIn addition to working with local, state, and federal government officials, the City is taking action to ensure the continuity of key public systems such as our emergency medical response, police protection, and public utility infrastructure.\n\nLove 3 Funny 3 Wow 0 Sad 2 Angry 1\n\nConcerned about COVID-19?

The current projection for the next fiscal year\u2019s budget calls for 2.5 percent increase in revenues and staff will look at scenarios for a drop in revenue as much as 7.5 percent.\n\n\u2022 City staff who can work at home are now working at home and non-essential hourly workers have been suspended, but some may be reassigned to essential positions, said Nancy Paulson, city manager.\n\n\u2022 Staff is also going to look into conducting board meetings via teleconference or phone.

Our Front Office Staff will be working from 9:00 am - 4:30 pm and you can call 732-681-3700 and follow the prompts for the department you require. If you have any questions, please call.\n\nThe Belmar Borough Council Meeting on Tuesday March 17, 2020 at 6:00pm will proceed as scheduled.

We are concerned with the health and well-being of our staff as well as the public we serve. As this virus continues to spread, our goal is to maintain a healthy police force for the continuation of services without resorting to contingency plans.\n\nIf you come to the police station to file a report, or to speak to an officer, know the conversation may occur through a window and\/or intercom.\n\nWe are encouraging you to call in to the station rather than walk in for non-emergencies. Non-emergent matters may be reported over the phone and an officer will take your report in this manner. This applies to a variety of less serious offenses that ARE NOT IN PROGRESS.\n\nIf you are calling for medical assistance and are requesting first aid\/EMS, the dispatcher will ask you a series of questions to make sure that all pertinent information is relayed to the officer and\/or EMS that will be responding. When it is possible, you will be asked to exit your home and meet with the officer or members of the first aid\/EMS.\n\nIf it is determined that a response by an officer is warranted, please understand that they are likely to keep a \"safe distance\" and unlikely to shake hands, etc. Again, this is out of an abundance of caution to keep our staff and the public safe and not an indicator of the officers' willingness to help.\n\nOFFICERS WILL ALWAYS RESPOND TO CRIMES OF VIOLENCE AND CRIMES AGAINST A PERSON.\n\n\n\nTax and water payments can be mailed to 601 Main Street, Belmar, NJ 07719.

Right here in New Jersey, there are a reported 23 presumptive positive cases to date that include both travel-related and community contact transmission, and more than 150 cases nationwide. On March 5, a 32-year-old Fort Lee man who frequents New York City -- where he is employed as a health care worker, and where the virus is more rapidly spreading -- was the first in the state to test positive for the virus at Hackensack University Medical Center where he has since been hospitalized and is recovering. Shortly thereafter, it was reported that a woman, also in her 30s, was being treated for the virus at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. On Tuesday, a 44-year-old Teaneck man tested positive for the virus and was hospitalized at Holy Name Medical Center.\n\nSign Up for Hackensack Newsletter Our newsletter delivers the local news that you can trust.

Exposure to the virus only poses life-threatening consequences in older individuals or those with a weakened immune system, or other underlying health conditions such as lung disease, according to health officials. The Little Ferry man who succumbed to the virus, identified as John Brennan, was a horse trainer who reportedly had emphysema, diabetes and hypertension.\n\nFollowing his death, Congressman Josh Gottheimer said the area\u2019s hospitals, health facilities, frontline medical professionals, and state and federal government are working to ensure the current outbreak is contained and that New Jersey residents are kept safe.\n\nEffective 5 p.m. today, the county closed county-operated senior activity centers to better protect senior citizens from contracting the virus until further notice.\n\nOn Tuesday, Tedesco issued an executive order mandating that all county agencies take appropriate action to assist municipal governments in containing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from COVID-19 outbreak. Tedesco is also authorizing county departments to prioritize the most vulnerable county residents served, and develop the appropriate contingency plans to avoid any disruption of services, specifically, senior centers and Meals-on-Wheels recipients, according to the order.\n\nThe order also authorizes all county employees to follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommendations regarding hand washing, sanitizing, and basic infection control procedures. All county businesses are also being asked to avoid business-related international or domestic travel to any states that have reported COVID-19 cases. Aside from China, travel to the following countries where the virus is widespread is also avoided: South Korea, Iran, Italy, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand.\n\n\n\n\n\nVisitation to the Bergen County Health Care Center in Rockleigh has also been suspended; the facility is directed to provide technological alternative interactions to residents instead. Similar measures are \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d at the other senior-focused facilities around the county. Senior citizens with underlying health conditions are also being advised to avoid large crowds while the virus remains a threat.\n\nIn addition to the executive order, the senate passed a bill proposed by Congressman Gottheimer to provide emergency funding for a \u201crobust response\u201d to the coronavirus crisis, including vaccine and treatment development and loans for small businesses affected by the virus. The legislation was signed into law by the President last Friday.\n\nDr. David Perlin, the founding Chief Scientific Officer and Senior Vice President for the Hackensack Meridian Health Center for Discovery and Innovation, said during a press conference on March 1 that the hospital has developed a molecular, in-house test in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines, that they plan to apply to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to have it ready to go for our network within the week,\u201d said Perlin. \u201cCurrently, the health department labs in New Jersey are authorized to test, and so this is certainly a plus. That way, we can send samples to the health department and the CDC for final validation.\u201d\n\nPrior to the press conference that day, Gottheimer convened with health officials from around the county at the Hackensack University Medical Center campus to discuss preparedness for the virus. At the time of the March 1 meeting, a mere five Americans had died from the virus -- a death toll that has since climbed to 30 in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be possibly a larger number of people infected,\u201d said Jerry Zuckerman, M.D. and vice president of Infection Prevention and Control at Hackensack Meridian Health. \u201cIn the past, the infections that we\u2019ve had have been much more limited. Today, we\u2019re all susceptible to the coronavirus even though it acts and seems like influenza. And we get that every year.\u201d\n\nCOVID-19 are part of a family of viruses which cause colds and other upper respiratory infections. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), signs of infection include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.\n\nPerlin said 80% of coronavirus cases are \"relatively mild\" and that recovery time can take anywhere from 2-3 weeks until the individuals are able to \u201cresume their normal lives.\u201d Only about 5% of cases, he said, have resulted in \"very serious, acute\" diseases and potentially life-threatening due to underlying health problems that the individual had before their exposure to the virus.\n\nPhysicians say the best protection against the virus is hand washing for 20 seconds and avoiding touching the nose, mouth and eyes while out in public. They also advise staying within 6 feet of individuals who are exhibiting signs of sickness like sneezing or coughing. The coronavirus, like other respiratory illnesses such as the common cold and the flu, can pass from respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes on or near another, specifically, landing in the mouths or noses of the healthy person, which can be inhaled into the lungs. People who are mildly sick should stay home, and those with a more severe illness warrants a trip to the Emergency Department.\n\nTo combat the rising tide of COVID-19 infection, the county, under the new executive order, will also procure the necessary supplies to ensure adequate sanitization, cleaning or sterilization of any facility or location.\n\nSeveral schools around Bergen County and beyond have also taken the necessary precautions against the virus and to restrain the spread of it. Most recently, the Frisch School in Paramus has been closed this past week to sanitize the building as a precaution after 28 schoolchildren who visited Westchester County last month believed they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBergen Community College will also cancel classes for the week of March 16 and will resume them on Monday, March 23.\n\nIn Teaneck, Fairleigh Dickinson University will switch to remote learning for all classes, effective Monday, March 16.\n\nFor concerns about coronavirus, call the New Jersey Department of Health Hotline at 1-800-222-1222.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":11000.0,"lat":40.8463,"lng":-74.0388}

A majority of councilmembers said Wednesday that they are likely to do so.\n\n\u201cThe declarations are legal documents,\u201d the city\u2019s announcement on the health emergency said, \u201cthat will mobilize city resources, accelerate emergency planning, streamline staffing, coordinate agencies across the city, allow for future reimbursement by the state and federal governments and raise awareness throughout Long Beach about how everyone can prepare in the event that COVID-19 appears in our community.\u201d\n\nAlthough it appears the virus has not yet arrived in Long Beach, Davis said in a Wednesday phone interview, the emergencies are necessary to prepare for if and when a local case does appear.\n\n\u201cShould we have a case in Long Beach,\u201d she said, \u201cthe basic public health measures in order to contain the virus necessitate a very large workforce.\u201d\n\nIf a single case is identified, Davis said, it\u2019s possible that person may have had 100 contacts with other people \u2014 family members, colleagues, fellow students, people in businesses they\u2019ve visited.\n\n\u201cThe public health responsibility is to find all those people,\u201d she said, \u201cmonitor them actively, recommend whether they should be quarantined or not, and recommend whether they should be tested or not.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to be able to deploy those resources immediately, Davis added, if and when the need arises.\n\nAs for whether Long Beach is at a high risk for an outbreak, Davis said it\u2019s hard to tell. She said there\u2019s nothing particularly unique about Long Beach that would increase its risk over that of other cities in the country \u2014 except for the fact that there are cases close by in Los Angeles County.\n\n\u201cSince there are more cases in the surrounding area,\u201d she said, \u201cit definitely highlights the fact that we need to be prepared.\u201d\n\nThe novel coronavirus was first detected in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31. It has since spread to more than 70 countries, including the United States, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nThere have been 93,090 confirmed cases globally, as of Wednesday, March 4, with with more than 12,660 of those outside of China, according to WHO data.\n\nCoronavirus, officials in Long Beach and elsewhere have said, usually causes mild symptoms, such as fever and cough. But it can cause more severe symptoms, such as pneumonia and difficulty breathing \u2014 and be fatal for certain folks, such as the elderly or those with other health problems.\n\nNearly 3,200 people have died worldwide, according to WHO.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been 108 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to WHO; it\u2019s unclear if that number includes the five New York state cases Gov. Andrew Cuomo confirmed Wednesday afternoon. Another 44 Americans, who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan last month, also were diagnosed withe the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nEleven deaths have been reported in the United States, 10 of which were in Washington state; Placer County, in Northern California, reported the state\u2019s first coronavirus death Wednesday.\n\nThe virus, Long Beach officials said, primarily spreads through person-to-person transmission \u2014 generally among those in close contact, within six feet \u2014 or through respiratory droplets via coughing or sneezing.\n\nThere has been some community transmission throughout the West Coast.\n\nThe Long Beach Health Department has activated its Department Operations Center, \u201cprioritizing resources and leadership to focus on the clinical, epidemiological and community response,\u201d officials said.\n\n\u201cThis is a global outbreak that is entering a new phase, and we must be prepared,\u201d Long Beach Health Director Kelly Colopy said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are, and have been, working closely with other city agencies, the private health care systems, and businesses and educational institutions,\u201d she added, \u201cto ensure that Long Beach is well informed and positioned to respond and do our best to mitigate the impact of the new virus, if it emerges in Long Beach.\u201d\n\nLong Beach officials also said they have received advice from the CDC on how to prepare for the virus.\n\nThe virus has already had some effect on Long Beach economically, with higher-than-usual cancellations of ships traveling from China to the Port of Long Beach, and a major trade conference set for this week getting canceled.\n\nBut Steve Goodling, the president and CEO for the Long Beach Area Convention & Visitors Bureau, said the cancellation of TPM20 has so far been an aberration.\n\nThe bureau has reached out to the organizers of all of the conventions scheduled for 2020 and two or three have \u201ctalked\u201d about possibly canceling their events. That\u2019s of 36 citywide conventions \u2014 boasting anywhere from 2,500 to 10,000 people \u2014 and 124 smaller conventions.\n\nThe Long Beach Convention Center, like other public buildings, has added sanitation stations and brought on additional workers to wipe down and clean surfaces frequently, Goodling said; all of the city\u2019s hotels, he added, have worked with their corporate parents to update cleaning-and-sanitation guidelines because of coronavirus. The Long Beach Airport has taken the same steps.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about,\u201d Goodling said, \u201cis the perception that Long Beach is a hotbed (for the virus), when it\u2019s not, will hurt attendance.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s he Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach, which still plans to put on its annual event next month. Organizers will work to mitigate the risk to race-goers, said Jim Michaelian, The president and CEO of the Grand Prix of Long Beach Association. More than 187,000 people are expected to attend the three-day event.\n\n\u201cSome of the precautions we and our partners will be taking include making sure all of our attendees have access to fully stocked handwashing stations as well as alcohol-based hand sanitizer,\u201d Michaelian said in a statement. \u201cIn addition, we will ensure that frequently touched surfaces are routinely cleaned and disinfected.\n\n\u201cAt this time,\u201d Michaelian added, \u201cthe threat to the general public is low and there are no changes planned to the regular operation of our event.\u201d\n\nDavis, for her part, said city officials are monitoring all major upcoming events \u2014 including the Grand Prix \u2014 as well as schools, businesses, restaurants and any other place where people tend to congregate.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make all the venues and all of our gatherings as safe as possible, so we\u2019re sending out a lot of guidance on access to handwashing and soap and things like that,\u201d she said, \u201cbut there\u2019s no thought about canceling anything.\u201d\n\nDavis said it is important that people remain aware of the preventative measures they can take \u2014 but that no one should panic.\n\nPasadena, meanwhile, also announced its own health emergency Wednesday.\n\nWhat you can do to reduce risk\n\nThese are the steps the Long Beach Health Department recommends folks take to reduce their risk of getting coronavirus:\n\nWash your hands with soap and water often for at least 20 seconds;\n\nAvoid touching eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands;\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick;\n\nCover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash;\n\nClean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces; and\n\nStay home if you are sick.\n\nDavis also said people should think about preparing for what it might look like if kids need to stay home from school or if people need to work from home. She recommended people with underlying health conditions ensure they have medication lined up and be in touch with their health care providers to discuss any other preventative measures they should take.\n\nStaff writer Olga Grigoryants and City News Service contributed to this report.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":33750.0,"lat":40.5887,"lng":-73.666}

The State of Emergency declaration is required to be eligible for FEMA or SEMA disaster reimbursements and allows Town staff to respond quicker to the constant changes that are occurring. Thankfully, as of 4:30 pm today, Caldwell County did not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\nThe top priority of the Town of Granite Falls is and always will be the safety and security of the community. As such, Town officials are taking the recent developments concerning COVID-19 into consideration as we make decisions on how to practice effective social distancing while maintaining essential Town services. Here are some of the administrative and service delivery changes that have already been implemented:\n\n-The Town Office will be limited to a drive-thru only operation until further notice. Please note, we allow walk up traffic at our drive-thru window. We will extend drive-thru window hours as necessary. All payment transactions can be accomplished by using the drive-thru window or the night drop box at the drive-thru, US mail, automatic bank drafts, on-line payments, or by telephone (844) 579-2880. If you need to sign up for new utility services, need any type of permits, or need to conduct any other type of business at the Town Office, please call (828) 396-3131 before coming to the Town Office. If you have any issues with existing Town utility services, please continue to call the Town Office at (828) 396-3131 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Monday through Friday. If you have any issues with existing Town utility services before or after normal business hours or on weekends, please continue to call the Police Department at (828) 396-3358. Do not call 911 to report any issues with Town utility services.\n\n-The Town of Granite Falls will not be disconnecting utility services for non-payment the month of March and will not assess late payment fees that are normally charged when utilities are disconnected. Town staff will revisit this situation each month going forward. Utility customers with past due balances need to remember that the Town is not forgiving past due balances, late payment fees, or penalties that were incurred before March 18th. Citizens with past due balances are encouraged to pay what they can, when they can, to keep their past due balance from increasing. Penalties will not be applied to any utility accounts until March 31st.\n\n-Public entrances to the Police Station are closed until further notice. Always call 911 to report an emergency. Please call the Police Department at (828) 396-3358 for information on how to access police reports, accident reports, etc. Most of these reports can be sent electronically. If you do not have access to electronic delivery of records, please call the Police Department in advance at (828) 396-3358, and they will arrange a time for you to pick these up in person.\n\n-Public entrances to the Fire Station are closed until further notice. Always call 911 to report an emergency. Please call the Fire Department at (828) 396-2379 if you need any type of information or services from Fire Department Personnel. Child safety seat installations will only be done in emergency situations. Any other reports or information requested from the Fire Department will be sent electronically if at all possible. If you do not have access to electronic delivery of records, please call the Fire Department in advance at (828) 396-2379 and they will arrange a time for you to pick these up in person.\n\n-Public entrances to the Public Works Department, the Electric Department, and the Wastewater and Water Treatment facilities are closed until further notice. The Town of Granite Falls Public Works Department is currently providing all standard services including brush collection and normally scheduled garbage, recycling, and refuse collection. We ask for patience with collection services due to the increased number of citizens at home during this time which will likely result in an increased amount of household waste. The Electric Department and the Wastewater and Water Treatment facilities are all operating as scheduled to continue providing these services safely to your homes and places of business. We want to remind citizens to NEVER flush wipes (even if the package states that the wipes are flushable), paper towels, linen, washcloths, hygiene products, or anything other than toilet paper. These items can cause preventable backup in residents\u2019 services and can create issues with the Town\u2019s wastewater collection system and treatment facility.\n\n-The Town Recreation Center building is closed to the public. The outdoor restrooms at the Recreation Center and Lakeside Park are also closed. The walking track, tennis courts, and playgrounds at the Recreation Center are still open. Outdoor activities are still available at Lakeside Park and Neighborhood Park.\n\n-Any further changes to Town services or operating conditions will be communicated via the Town\u2019s website and on Facebook pages for Granite Falls Police Department, North Carolina and Granite Falls Parks & Recreation Department. Another great way to stay connected is to sign up for Town updates by phone calls (home and\/or cell), texts, or emails through the CodeRed citizen notification system. If you aren\u2019t signed up for CodeRed, please contact the Town Office at (828) 396-3131 or sign up online.\n\nPlease remember, if you see any Town employees out and about and they do not approach you as they would normally do, these Town employees are practicing social distancing in an effort to maintain public health and safety in our community. Our goal is to keep Town employees healthy to respond to true emergencies in the community and to maintain the level of services our citizens expect and deserve.\n\nThanks for your patience during this difficult time.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":4659.0,"lat":35.7965,"lng":-81.4233}

Henry McMaster's executive orders.\n\nLocal closings and updates: Schools | Colleges | Grocery stores | Churches | Businesses & Events | Restaurants | Malls | Hospitals]\n\nLast week, the city had intended to pass its own ordinance similar to Charleston and Columbia and some coastal towns \u2014 but backed off after state Attorney General Alan Wilson issued an opinion saying such laws leave municipalities under threat of a legal action.\n\nMcMaster has yet to order a statewide decree ordering people to stay at home, despite mounting calls to do so.\n\nOn Monday, 151 new cases of COVID-19 were reported by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control, bringing the total number of cases statewide to 925 across 41 counties. Eighteen have died, and among them was Anderson County's first reported death. Greenville County saw 17 new reported cases Monday.\n\nIn the U.S., there were more than 160,000 cases as of Monday afternoon and nearly 3,000 deaths.\n\n\"According to the CDC and local public health officials, this is the critical period to stop the virus from spreading,\" White told The News. \"It\u2019s here. A large metro area like Greenville absolutely must double down now to keep the virus under control.\"\n\nThe ordinance, published in draft form this afternoon (see below), allows for people to go out to exercise so long as it can be done with six feet of distance and doesn't involve shared equipment.\n\nGolf courses can stay open. Gyms, dance studios, bowling alleys and other indoor entertainment cannot.\n\nNon-essential services not listed as part of the ordinance (see full list of eligible activities) would be allowed but not if they require less than six feet of distance, which makes cutting hair or painting nails impossible.\n\nThe ban on dine-in service continues, though take out, curbside and delivery are still allowed.\n\nThe ordinance doesn't prevent someone from traveling out of the city for a non-essential purpose.\n\nMore: Greenville to 're-evaluate' proposed COVID-19 stay-at-home order in light of Attorney General opinion\n\nFor more than a week, the mayor has signaled his desire for \"personal services\" businesses that aren't essential to close but has had not authority to do so absent the governor taking action.\n\nThe ordinance would specify that keeping a six foot distance, as suggested by the CDC, is required by law. This would include grocery stores and home improvement stores that have seen a rush of business but have had inconsistent measures to ensure distancing.\n\n\"Many people have weighed in over the past days,\" White said. \"None more persuasive than health care professionals, nurses and doctors, who reside in great numbers in our city\u2019s neighborhoods. They need our support and are asking specifically for this kind of action.\"\n\nThe issue of local stay-at-home orders has turned into a political football in the past several days. Urban leaders have begged the governor to enact a statewide order, just as the cities and the state of North Carolina have. Today, U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, who has the COVID-19 virus, pleaded for McMaster to act.\n\nMcMaster has said he believes he has acted adequately to address the spread and based his decisions on science, data and advice of health experts.\n\nThe rural areas of the state haven't pushed hard for any stay-at-home orders. Greenville County Council Chairman Butch Kirven said that the governor's actions have sufficed, which he said is seen in the behavior of citizens who have generally followed the governor's direction.\n\nThe attorney general's opinion last week sent doubt throughout communities that enacted their own ordinances. Coastal towns like Folly Beach rescinded their measures on Friday for fear of being sued by the state and implored McMaster take action. By Saturday, Folly Beach had reinstated its restrictions after people flocked to the shore.\n\nColumbia and Charleston pledged to forge ahead with their ordinances, which the city of Greenville essentially copied.\n\nOn Sunday, Wilson's office issued a clarification stating that while a private citizen could sue a municipality or county, the opinion didn't go so far as to say a local government couldn't continue to enforce ordinances unless a court ordered otherwise.\n\nSee the full list of essential businesses here:\n\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter @cericconnor\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.greenvilleonline.com\/story\/news\/local\/greenville\/downtown\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-greenville-stay-home-require-6-feet-distance-close-nonessential-business\/5089580002\/","category":"shelter_in_place","population":128385.0,"lat":35.5956,"lng":-77.3768}

There are 45 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Quebec, of whom 20 are in intensive care.\n\nLegault notes that the province is now grouping probable and confirmed cases, which accounts in part for

to try to treat COVID-19 until scientific evidence confirms its efficacy.\n\nThe warning follows reports on social media that hydroxychloroquine can cure the respiratory illness.\n\nAmong those who have repeated the claim is U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTam says there is a large number of pre-existing medications that scientists are looking at to see whether they can treat COVID-19, but people should not take anything until the results are confirmed.\n\nTam adds that some of the medications have serious side effects that can actually hurt those who take them.\n\nPrime minister to contact premiers today to determine next moves\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland says Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s phone call with premiers later today will be important for getting a

Emergencies Act this week.\n\nHealth Minister Patty Hajdu is also leaving the door open to strict enforcement of social distancing, describing it as \u201cnot nice to have,\u201d but absolutely essential.\n\nChief public health officer Theresa Tam, meanwhile, says more than a dozen people remain in quarantine at CFB Trenton after being evacuated from the Grand Princess cruise ship earlier this month and subsequently testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nTam also says public-health authorities are continuing \u201crigorous contact tracing\u201d to identify anyone who comes in contact with a person who has COVID-19.\n\nPEI: No new cases\n\nPrince Edward Island\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, says there are no new cases of COVID-19 in the province.\n\nThere are

managers will be able to allocate the funding where they need it most.\n\nManitoba: Cancel non-essential travel\n\nManitoba officials are telling people to cancel non-essential travel outside of the province as another case of COVID-19 is confirmed.\n\nDr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba\u2019s chief provincial public health officer, says anyone who returns from travel, either international or domestic, should self-isolate for 14 days.\n\nThe latest case is a man in his 50s from Winnipeg and it is believed to be travel-related.\n\nRoussin said one other probable case has been found not to be the novel coronavirus.\n\nThere are a total of 20 confirmed and presumptive cases of the virus in Manitoba.\n\nNew flights for Canadians stranded abroad\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is announcing multiple new flights to bring home Canadians who have been stranded abroad due to the novel coronavirus.\n\nTrudeau says Air Canada, Air Transat, WestJet and Sunwing airlines all have flights planned

local exposure and people in high-risk populations are to receive tests first if they show symptoms.\n\nIncluded will be people in hospital with respiratory illness, residents in continuing care homes and travellers who returned from abroad between March 8th and March 12th before self-isolation was required.\n\nHealth-care workers who have respiratory symptoms will also receive priority.\n\nNova Scotia: 13 more cases\n\nThirteen new cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Nova Scotia, bringing the province\u2019s total to 41.\n\nThe new cases were confirmed yesterday and announced this morning.\n\nThe province says the cases are related to travel or to earlier reported cases.\n\nIt says the 41 individuals affected range in age from under 10 to mid-70s.\n\nAt this point, there has

help create and produce vaccines for COVID-19.\n\nThe money will be distributed to a number of different companies and universities in the drive to find a way to stop the illness\u2019s spread.\n\nThe federal government is also unveiling advertisements to hammer home the importance of social distancing.\n\nThe move is in response to concerns some people are continuing to ignore calls for distancing

to try to treat COVID-19 until scientific evidence confirms its efficacy.\n\nThe warning follows reports on social media that hydroxychloroquine can cure the respiratory illness.\n\nAmong those who have repeated the claim is U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nTam says there is a large number of pre-existing medications that scientists are looking at to see whether they can treat COVID-19, but

person who has COVID-19.\n\nPEI: No new cases\n\nPrince Edward Island\u2019s chief public health officer, Dr. Heather Morrison, says there are no new cases of COVID-19 in the province.\n\nThere are

Montgomery Advertiser\n\nA circuit judge has amended his order calling for the release of some inmates in Autauga, Elmore and Chilton county jails with bonds under $5,000.\n\nPresiding Circuit Judge Ben Fuller, of Autauga County, entered the order Wednesday afternoon calling for all inmates to be released. The amendment gave sheriffs the discretion on releasing inmates based on their perceived threat to the public. The order states the inmates would be released on their own recognizance in an effort to ease overcrowding over fears of the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nFuller's actions had law enforcement and other judges in the circuit scrambling. They apparently were not consulted before the original order came down.\n\nVictims and relatives of victims were burning up the phone lines Thursday at the three district attorneys offices in the circuit.\n\n\"They were all concerned about the order and just what that meant for their cases,\" said Chief Assistant District Attorney C.J. Robinson. \"We couldn't file the necessary motions we need to file because of all the calls.\"\n\nThe office is reviewing each case. Release of inmates deemed a threat to the public or law enforcement will be protested.\n\n\"We understand the coronavirus pandemic and the potential exposure risks that are on everyone\u2019s mind, but our main concern is to protect our community,\" Robinson wrote in a lengthy post on his Facebook page. \"Make no mistake; the safety of victims will take precedence in our decision-making.\"\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court has suspended all court actions due to the fear of the spread of the coronavirus. The exception is proceedings deemed to be emergencies. Robinson said the release protests can be made through court records, and hearings may not be required on each case.\n\nAutauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger was conducting an audit of inmates Wednesday night to determine who would be covered.\n\n\"I have the discretion on releasing anyone, whether they can post bond or not,\" Sedinger said. \"If I feel there is a threat to the public, I won't release them.\"\n\nWhere is the coronavirus?: Interactive maps track COVID-19 cases across Alabama and beyond\n\nThe metro holds inmates charged with felonies and inmates arrested on misdemeanor charges by the Prattville Police Department.\n\n\"We will be reviewing all our cases that apply,\" said Police Chief Mark Thompson. \"If we feel the person is a threat to the public or a threat to officer safety, we are going to protest their release.\"\n\nBy noon Thursday, Sedinger had released seven inmates arrested by the Prattville PD on misdemeanor charges, but only after the approval of Thompson.\n\nElmore County Circuit Judge Bill Lewis Jr. entered a subsequent order following Fuller's original order. Lewis' order tells the sheriffs in all three counties not to release any inmates involved in his cases for five days until he has a chance to review their files.\n\nThe circuit is served by three judges, with Sibley Reynolds representing Chilton County.\n\nMost crimes that would get a $5,000 or under bonds are misdemeanors and some Class C and D felonies. District Attorney Randall Houston has concerns.\n\nVolunteers step up: Rescue Mission provides emergency food giveaway during coronavirus pandemic\n\n\"If you have a sex offender in jail who has not gotten an approved address to live after release, he may have a $5,000 bond,\" Houston said. \"He gets out under this blanket order..\n\n\"My concern is this is a blanket order with the decision made by a judge without consultation of us or other judges. A judge who who has no knowledge of all the cases.\"\n\nCrimes on the list that could receive a $5,000 or under bond include criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, some domestic violence cases, some DUI cases, incest, sexual abuse, enticing a child for immoral purposes, escape and some robbery charges.\n\nExperts caution that the highly infectious COVID-19 could wreak havoc in jails and prisons, where the social distancing recommendation public officials are spreading far and wide is impractical at best.\n\nNot seeing the map?

Gordon Urges Residents to Stay Home to Prevent Virus Spreading","text":"By Jim Angell, Cowboy State Daily\n\nThe only way Wyoming residents will be able to avoid further restrictions on their actions will be to comply with the three orders now in place designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wednesday.\n\nGordon, speaking during a news conference, said the state orders closing businesses and prohibiting gatherings of 10 or more people have all been issued only after careful consideration.\n\n\u201cWe are not trying to shut down Wyoming,\u201d he said. \u201cBut your voluntary action and discipline will make the difference on whether we can slow the spread of COVID-19. I want to emphasize the orders we put in place are only effective if you take them seriously.\u201d\n\nWyoming\u2019s coronavirus case count on Wednesday stood at 44 and the state last week issued orders closing all business where more than 10 people are likely to gather, such as bars, theaters and fitness clubs. Also last week, the state prohibited gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\nOn Tuesday, Gordon and Dr. Alexia Harrist, the state\u2019s health officer, ordered the closure of businesses that provide personal services, such as hair salons, barbershops and tattoo parlors.Gordon said the best reason to limit the spread of the virus is to avoid overwhelming Wyoming\u2019s health care providers.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure that should this crisis come in greater detail \u2026 that we have adequate hospital facilities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just coronavirus that we are worried about this. If our hospitals are filled and somebody breaks a leg, you will not be able to be taken to a hospital.\u201d\n\nMike Ceballos, director of the Wyoming Department of Health, echoed Gordon\u2019s sentiments.\n\n\u201cWe need to take this seriously,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reason we issued these three orders is so we potentially and hopefully don\u2019t need to take more draconian measures.\u201d\n\nCeballos was one of several state officials who joined Gordon in the news conference to discuss what their agencies have been doing in response to the coronavirus. He said the state Public Health Laboratory has increased its coronavirus testing capacity by tenfold and has sent more than 2,500 sample collection kits to health care providers around the state.\n\nAlso attending the news conference was First Lady Jennie Gordon, whose Wyoming Hunger Initiative has created a task force of organizations that exist to address hunger in the state. Jennie Gordon said because of the task force\u2019s work, the Wyoming Food Bank of the Rockies will be organizing mobile food pantries that will travel to different towns around Wyoming to offer assistance.\n\nWith business closures contributing to higher unemployment rates, Robin Cooley, director of the state\u2019s Division of Workforce Services, said her agency has added 15 people to its claims processing center to keep up with the number of claims coming in.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing more than the usual number of people seeking unemployment assistance,\u201d she said. \u201cOur unemployment insurance staff is keeping up with that demand. Those filing claims can expect to see benefits within two days of filing them.\u201d\n\nCooley said the state is also looking into ways to keep workers on their jobs in the private sector through the use of federal dollars. She said as an example, federal money might be used to help employers buy computers to allow their workers to do their jobs from home.\n\nThe governor said the state is doing all it can to make sure Wyoming residents remain healthy and the state\u2019s economy survives the pandemic, however, he said residents must do their part as well.\n\n\u201cIt requires commitment from all of you to stay at home and be willing to sacrifice in the short term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must be honest about the enormity of this public challenge facing us and respond to it.\u201d","category":"shelter_in_place","population":214.0,"lat":39.9303,"lng":-84.5091}

Moe\u2019s Original BBQ, Dragon Village and Daye Y Noche have closed for now in Granville.\n\nDay Y Noche officially shut down operations on March 22, according to its website. A posting there states, \u201cWe have added e-gift cards that can be purchased for those of you who are interested. Thank you for everything this past week.\u201d\n\nOn March 24, the first day after an executive order for all Ohioans to stay at home took effect, Granville restaurant operators noted business had slowed further.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hanging in there,\u201d said Dave Thomas, working the grill at Aladdin Restaurant on March 24. Over a few sizzling hamburger patties and some strips of bacon, Thomas said while working his spatula, \u201cThis is a totally weird time.\"\n\nAladdin\u2019s is operating for carryout 6:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. these days. \u201cBusiness is slower,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cA lot of our customers are older and they just aren\u2019t getting out anymore.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo Kelly Zanks of Broadway Pub completes a curbside order on March 24.

To limit transmission risk, carryout customers can\u2019t enter the pub, and all transactions are credit card only \u2013 no hard currency. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to keep the spread down, Zanks explained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we can,\u201d she said. The Pub\u2019s hours are currently 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Saturday.\n\nDonatos, located at 116 E. Broadway, is also continuing operations. Now in its third year in business in downtown Granville, Donato's is continuing with delivery and pick up at its Granville location.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been slow,\u201d Chad Short of the Village Coffee Company said. He said it got even slower Monday after the governor\u2019s executive order was announced the previous Sunday afternoon, and was slower still on Tuesday morning, the first full day for Ohio under the Stay at Home order.\n\nBuy Photo Chairs are roped off from public use inside the Village Coffee Company.

I\u2019m just hopeful this is not going to go on too long.\u201d\n\nMai Chau, across Prospect Street from Steamroller, has prepared a special carryout menu and is operating 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tyler Wilson said most transactions occurring there are also largely through credit cards.\n\nSeveral were busy in the kitchen at Alfie\u2019s Wholesome Foods March 24, which was also launching home delivery that day. Alfie\u2019s is operating 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\nBusiness there has been steady, and customers \u201cupbeat and optimistic.\u201d\n\nBuy Photo \u201cWe\u2019re trying to adapt in any way we can,\u201d Steamroller's Jay Snyder said March 24.

The court serves Lyndhurst, Mayfield Heights, Mayfield, Gates Mills, Richmond Heights and Highland Heights.\n\nChanges include:\n\n-- All appearances and hearings will be limited to attorneys, defendants and victims, or anyone making payments to the court. Anyone not having business with the court will not be permitted entrance to the courthouse.\n\n-- Jailed defendants: The court will continue to see the majority of jailed defendants via video conferencing. The court will see Lyndhurst prisoners in person. Coletta will continue to attempt to keep to a minimum those housed in jail.\n\n-- Criminal and traffic arraignments: Criminal and traffic arraignments will be continued for at least two weeks. Law enforcement will be advised of the arraignment dates for newly issued citations and complaints.\n\n-- Criminal\/traffic pretrials, hearings and trials: In cases in which the defendant previously waived his or her right to a speedy trial, all proceedings (pretrials, status hearings, show cause hearings and trials) will be continued for at least three weeks. This includes all hearings scheduled through April 10.\n\nAll hearings now scheduled on or after April 13 will remain as currently scheduled.\n\n-- Probation appointments: As soon as feasible, the court will extend reporting via telephone to as many probationers as possible. Probationers are to report as regularly scheduled until contacted by the probation department.\n\n-- Felony initial appearances: The court will continue to hold a felony initial appearance docket at 10:30 a.m. every Monday.\n\n-- Civil pretrials: Effective immediately, all civil pretrials will be conducted via telephone.\n\n-- Civil trials: Effective immediately, all civil trials, including small claims trials, will be suspended for 30 days.\n\n-- Eviction hearings: Effective immediately, all eviction hearings will be continued for at least three weeks. All hearings currently scheduled on or after April 13 will be held as scheduled.\n\nThe judge notes that the public health emergency may be considered \u201cjust cause\u201d for continuances deemed necessary by the court on a case-by-case basis.\n\nWhile Coletta believes the steps described will significantly reduce the number of people appearing in court, he said that defendants can also take steps to eliminate or postpone their next court appearance.\n\nThe court is encouraging people to make online payments, when possible, through its website lyndhurstmunicipalcourt.org. Those who do not want to contest a waiverable citation may conclude their case by paying their fine online. No court appearance is necessary. Pay plan payments can also be made online.\n\nIn addition, drop box payments can also be made on the first floor of Lyndhurst City Hall, near the police station window. Payments via check, cash or money order can be dropped in the box 24 hours per day, seven days per week.\n\n-- Continuances: Those who would like to contest a case can avoid coming to the courthouse for their arraignment by filing a \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea prior to their arraignment. Defendants can download a not guilty plea from the court\u2019s website, fill it out and file it with the court prior to their arraignment date.\n\nThe not guilty form also gives defendants the option to waive their right to a speedy trial and permit the court to set their next court appearance at a later date.\n\n-- Filings: The court will continue to accept filings at the window, and also by fax or mail. The court\u2019s fax number is 440-442-1910. The court will also accept filings via its drop box during this emergency period. The court, however, encourages filings by fax or mail, as opposed to in-person filings.\n\n-- Speedy trial waivers: Any defendant that previously demanded a speedy trial, but later decides to continue his or her pretrial or trial, can download a \u201cmotion to continue\u201d form from the court\u2019s website and file it with the court using the above filing methods.\n\nColetta stated that the court will continue to assess the situation to determine if additional precautions are necessary. The temporary order that Coletta put into effect March 17 will remain in place until further order of the court.\n\nRead more from the Sun Messenger.","category":"None","population":13557.0,"lat":41.5172,"lng":-81.4922}

(Photo: Craig McDonald\/The Advocate)\n\nLess than a week after restaurant and bars\u2019 common public dining and drinking areas were ordered closed by the state, many locally owned Pataskala eateries are striving to adapt to various forms of takeout and curbside service.\n\nA common complaint among Pataskala residents has long been a perceived lack of sufficient numbers of local dining options, particularly along Ohio 40 once east of Mink Street. Gov. DeWine's order closing bars and restaurants for sit-down service threatens to further narrow diners' options.\n\nDig deeper: Licking County restaurants scramble for way forward during ordered closures\n\nNow those mom and pop and family businesses that have been serving Pataskala consumers are trying to ramp up meal service that some hope will tide them over until dining areas can be reopened.\n\nOne of those particularly challenged at the moment to keep serving is Nutcracker Family Restaurant at 63 E. Broad.\n\nIn a Facebook post made a few hours after the ordered March 15 closure, the Nutcracker Facebook page stated, \u201cWe are 100% reopening once this passes and the answers we get tomorrow will help guide our path for the immediate future. The other big issue that will now be facing businesses with this state-wide order is a shortage of carry out supplies as this is hitting many states at the same time and the supply chain has no time to react. We ask that you think of our employees and all small business employees that now are scared and worried at this time they\u2019re our #1 concern right now.\u201d\n\nBy March 18, Nutcracker was offering carryout of a limited number of meal options geared at using up perishables.\n\nBuy Photo Steve Butcher Jr. in the empty and partly dismantled dining room of the Nutcracker Family Restaurant in Pataskala. The order closure of group dining spaces is being used as opportunity for a \"detailed cleaning\" as Butcher termed it March 18. (Photo: Craig McDonald\/The Advocate)\n\nSteve Butcher Jr., sitting in his partially dismantled dining area which is undergoing a thorough \u201cdetail cleaning\u201d as absence of diners allows for that extra scrub, talked of the challenges and his still uncertain path forward until the closure order is lifted.\n\nHe is adamant when the closures are relaxed, the Nutcracker known and loved by loyal patrons will return. But in the meantime?\n\nAs alluded to in that Facebook post, infrastructure challenges to package and move take out from an operation long geared to sit-down dining remains a challenge. But the other factor, Butcher said, is that business model that\u2019s served Nutcracker for over a quarter century.\n\nThe Advocate is making all COVID-19 coverage available for free to our readers. Please consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to The Advocate at offers.newarkadvocate.com.\n\n\u201cWhenever you do carryout, sometimes the quality of what you do is not the same quality as when you eat it in,\u201d Butcher said. \u201cFrom a staffing standpoint, and a utility standpoint, and just a run-cost of every day what our minimum that we would have to do, it\u2019s not going to be profitable for us. We\u2019re in that balance of we\u2019ve done really well, we had a good January-February, and so now to try and just basically run cost, and basically be in the hole every day, and have extra run cost and maybe not net the proceeds?\u201d\n\nThe bottom-line as Butcher describes it: \u201cNobody really knows if carryout is going to be able to pay the bills. The consensus right now at least across the state is that it\u2019s not, except maybe for those businesses that were already doing a lot of business in carryout.

Trump's emergency declaration provides funds, flexibility for state, local officials to deal with coronavirus","text":"WASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency Friday, under a law typically used during hurricanes, to authorize aid to state and local governments and to waive regulations that hinder access to health care.\n\n\u201cTo unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe declaration authorizes Alex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, to:\n\nWaive laws to enable telehealth services, for remote doctor visits and hospital checkins.\n\nWaive certain federal licensing requirements so doctors from other states can provide services\n\nWaive requirements that critical-access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 or the length of stay of 96 hours.\n\nWaive a requirement for a three-day hospital stay before transfer to a nursing home.\n\nAllow hospitals to bring additional physicians on board and obtain additional office space.\n\nWaive rules that severely restrict hospital care of patients within the hospital itself, ensuring that the emergency capacity can be enhanced.\n\n\u201cNo resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever,\u201d Trump said.\n\nSeema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the waivers would suspend regulations that could get in the way of treating patients. Her agency will be issuing guidance to nursing homes to temporarily restrict all visitors and nonessential personnel, with exceptions for end-of-life situations.\n\nMore:Trump shakes several guests' hands at coronavirus press conference, despite repeated advice not to\n\n\u201cWe are doing what we must to protect our vulnerable elderly,\u201d Verma said.\n\nThe emergency declaration fell under the 1988 Stafford Act, which is typically used for crop failures or natural disasters such as hurricanes rather than public health emergencies. But the declaration, combined with Azar's previous declaration of a public health emergency on Jan. 31, allowed for more federal flexibility in dealing with the crisis.\n\nThe public health emergency fund hasn\u2019t received funding since 1999, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster fund has $42.6 billion.\n\nMore:US hospitals will run out of beds if coronavirus cases spike\n\n\u201cThis appears to be a roundabout way to get at the funding, by declaring an emergency,\" said Elizabeth Goitein, who co-directs the liberty and national security program at New York University\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nefarious about it. The coronavirus definitely meets the definition of the emergency in the statute.\u201d\n\nA Stafford Act declaration requires a request from a governor. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said he asked Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday to declare a national emergency to unlock resources on the front lines. Washington state has had 31 deaths from coronavirus, also called COVID-19, largely at a Kirkland, Wash., assisted-living facility.\n\n\u201cBy declaring a national emergency, the federal government can provide states with direct assistance to meet our residents\u2019 needs for health care, shelter, food and cash assistance, and more,\u201d Inslee said.\n\nFEMA funding could potentially be used to create temporarily medical facilities if hospitals become overcrowded, or to relocate equipment such as ventilators.\n\n\u201cThe imagination is kind of the limit here on figuring out how FEMA could be involved because this crisis is going to impact so many different aspects and elements of our life,\u201d Goitein said.\n\nGerald Parker, director of the pandemic and biosecurity program at Texas A&M University, said Health and Human Services would still lead the response to coronavirus, but that the emergency declaration enables a much broader response.\n\n\u201cThis has become much more than a public health and medical event,\u201d Parker said. \u201cA lot of other government agencies are going to have to be part of the solution here, at all levels.\"\n\nMore:Trump declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency. What does that mean?\n\nDozens of Senate Democrats had been urging Trump for days to declare a disaster to that states could use the FEMA money, which would provide 75% of the costs to state and local governments to prevent and reduce the spread of disease.\n\n\u201cI'm pleased the president heeded our calls to invoke the Stafford Act to extend vital financial assistance to help keep communities safe from the coronavirus outbreak,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"I urge New York and other states to immediately request these newly available funds and for the Trump administration to approve these requests without delay.\"\n\nSince the 1960s, public health emergencies were declared sporadically for incidents under the predecessor to the Stafford Act called the Disaster Relief Act. One declaration for Louisiana and Mississippi in 1962 involved a chlorine barge accident. Another declaration in 1978 covered the evacuation for New York\u2019s Love Canal chemical site.\n\nMore:Coronavirus updates: Trump declares national emergency; many schools close, events canceled\n\nThe Stafford Act then defined an emergency more broadly to cover when federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety.\n\nIn 2000, President Bill Clinton declared emergencies in New York and New Jersey for the West Nile Virus, a mosquito-borne illness, to reimburse states for mosquito abatement.\n\n\u201cThese are the only instances of a Stafford Act declaration in response to an infectious disease incident,\u201d the CRS report said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":76.0,"lat":39.7124,"lng":-81.2765}

CBS 2 Morning Insider takes us on a fascinating tour of a company literally switching gears to help with the crisis.\n\nWhen the buzz of a \u201cstay at home\u201d order began, the hum halted at the Richards-Wilcox factory in west suburban Aurora.\n\nAll 150 or so workers were told to power down, \u201cwith the uncertain future of not knowing when they were going to return to work,\u201d Richards-Wilcox president Bob McMurtry said.\n\nMcMurtry knew he could reverse the shutdown if his operations were considered essential.\n\n\u201cI was thinking what can we do to preserve jobs, but more importantly, help with the COVID-19 crisis?\u201d he said.\n\nThen a lightbulb went off.\n\n\u201cWe could convert one of our products into emergency beds,\u201d he said.\n\nWith a little tweaking, machines used to make shelving units are now churning out the place coronavirus patients will rest their heads across the country.\n\n\u201cIt had to be something that we could mass produce, so it needed to take advantage of what we already had tooled, and the equipment that we had in place to make high volume production parts,\u201d McMurtry said.\n\nFrom laser-cutting sheets, to stamping out notches for the posts, to welding it all together, the combo of human and automated labor could crank out 500 emergency beds per shift.\n\nWhile many businesses are laying off workers, Richards-Wilcox might need to start hiring if the COVID-19 outbreak worsens.\n\nOrders in tens of thousands could come in, with states like Illinois, New York, California, and Louisiana already showing interest.\n\n\u201cIt can be a bench, it can a desk or a table, and they can reconfigure it literally in a matter of a minute or two,\u201d McMurtry said.\n\nNo tools are needed for the fast assembly or disassembly; and, as crucial as time is for this crisis, so is sanitation.\n\nOne of the last parts of the production line sends pieces into a giant oven, where a special powder is baked on.\n\n\u201cWe have an antimicrobial paint, which prevents any virus from living on the surface of the paint,\u201d McMurtry said.\n\nAt $470 apiece, the beds should be ready to ship by next Monday; complete with a mattress from the Elgin-based company Moonlight Slumber.\n\nThe Richards-Wilcox factory will start mass production of the beds on Thursday. About 20 new hires will be needed if orders start pouring in.","category":"None","population":1020.0,"lat":45.2286,"lng":-122.7572}

Homeowners who have a pre-authorized payment plan set up with the city, which is about 30 per cent of taxpayers, will have to contact the city to get their plans changed.\n\nAdministration said it would also consider moving back the August and October tax deadlines, dependent on the COVID-19 situation in June and later on in 2020.\n\nThe other major financial change approved on Monday is the elimination of late fees for water and wastewater bills. A 90-day grace period will now be allowed for those bills.\n\nThe two financial moves come at a cost though, along with a $235,000 emergency grant for community, youth and cultural programming. Thunder Bay city manager Norm Gale said the funding will be used by community groups that already receive funding from the city.\n\nThe total cost relating to tax deferrals, as well as waiving penalties on water bills, and other COVID-19 initiatives will cost the city $672,000.\n\nLost revenue from water bills this year could impact next year's water rate, administration said. The city is also seeing a large decline in water consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTransit changes\n\nThe city's other measures, including free parking at meters and free public transit will also take about $80,000 and $420,000 out of city revenues per month.\n\nCouncil also approved service reductions for transit, which will be implemented starting Sunday, April 5. The reductions will be determined by transit management, and can also be adjusted as needed during the provincial state of emergency because of staffing issues at the transit division.\n\nCity transit manager Brad Loroff told council the changes to service are also required because of a lack of ridership. He said during the week, trips were down by about 60 per cent, from an average of 19,500 riders per day, to about 7,800. Some routes were down by 80 per cent, he said.\n\nThe plan, at the moment, is to operate a service similar to the Sunday schedule, which would provide frequency on most routes every 45 minutes. Loroff said he hoped routes would start around 6 a.m. during the week, to accommodate those going to work. However, buses would stop running around 11 p.m.\n\nCoun. Andrew Foulds was the lone council member to vote against the transit changes, noting he had one constituent who worked at Superstore, and needed to ride the bus to his workplace from Current River. He said the city needs to support those who require transit for work.\n\nGale acknowledged that the changes would be an inconvenience to some, but they were necessary.\n\nLoroff said the transit changes were not just because of ridership, but that staff were calling in sick more often than normal, and transit cannot properly maintain its schedule.\n\nHe said drivers were also helping to clean buses, which was taking more time than normal. During regular operations, each bus would be given a \"deep clean\" on a weekly basis, while that is now being done daily.\n\nLoroff said other changes at transit could include eliminating the front seats in all buses, to ensure passengers sit as far away from the driver as possible.\n\nCoun. Aldo Ruberto asked about giving drivers gloves and masks - but Gale said that was not necessary, and that supplies are needed for front line healthcare workers.","category":"None","population":1385.0,"lat":45.5216,"lng":-123.8858}

He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":340.0,"lat":45.2006,"lng":-123.8842}

And, much like Charleston\u2019s stay at home order, Columbia\u2019s measure has broad exceptions which will allow \u201cessential\u201d businesses and functions \u2014 such as grocery stores, gas stations, media, pharmacies, takeout and delivery restaurant services, manufacturing businesses, banks and insurance offices, commercial and residential construction and repairs, and many, many others \u2014 to continue to operate if they so choose.\n\nCity Council passed the measure during a Thursday afternoon meeting. The vote was 6-1, with Councilman Daniel Rickenmann voting \"no.\"\n\nThe order \u2014 which the city calls Stay Home, Stay Safe \u2014 would go into effect at 12:01 a.m. March 29. The order says that, after that time, \u201cindividuals shall stay in their homes and not travel through or congregate in the streets, sidewalks, waterways and\/or public spaces in the City of Columbia\u201d unless they are traveling to work or do business with one of the long list of essential services that are allowed under the measure.\n\nThe city is ordering those functions operating under the guise of essential services to enforce \u201csocial distancing\u201d of at least six feet between people.\n\nOutdoor activity and exercise is still be allowed under the stay at home order, though the measure says citizens should \u201climit outdoor recreational activities to those that allow for social distancing of at least six feet, do not entail coming into close contact with other people or involve the sharing of equipment.\u201d\n\nThe stay at home order is good for 14 days, but the city could go back and extend it if need be.\n\nColumbia\u2019s edict for people to stay at home is just the latest in a string of measures that have been put in place in the Capital City and across South Carolina in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, the lethal virus that has touched off a global pandemic. Columbia currently is under a nightly curfew from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Gov. Henry McMaster has given law enforcement leeway to break up any groups larger than three people in public. The governor has also shuttered all dine-in services at bars and restaurants across South Carolina and barred groups from congregating on the state's beaches.\n\n\u201cIt is imperative that residents and non-residents of this great city shelter at home, unless providing or requiring an essential service,\u201d City Council\u2019s March 26 order reads.\n\nMuch as as it has done across the rest of the country, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across South Carolina. According to numbers released by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control, as of the afternoon of March 25 there were 424 cases across 39 counties in South Carolina.\n\nThird-term Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin said Thursday that he thought a stay at home order was the appropriate next step for a city that is desperate to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"We've been on a smart path, a responsible path, trying to do every single thing we can possibly do to curb the growth of this virus in our community,\" Benjamin said.\n\nAs of March 25, eight people had died from the novel coronavirus in South Carolina. Among them was Jack West, the longtime Statehouse lobbyist and son of former Gov. John West.\n\nSecond-term Columbia City Councilman Howard Duvall, 77, told Free Times he was in favor of a stay at home order.\n\n\"We want to ask people to accept the seriousness of this situation, and start behaving like it is a very serious situation,\" Duvall says. \"Even if you are young and might be able to survive this thing, it is up to all of us to accept the responsibility. It doesn't do me any good, being 77, for a 20-year-old to think they are not going to get it, then give it to me.\"\n\nColumbia had an eye on what Charleston did earlier this week as it crafted its draft stay at home ordinance, including its vast list of \"essential services\" exceptions.\n\n\"We tried our best to replicate the list that Charleston used in the interests of consistency,\" Benjamin tells Free Times.\n\nAs noted by The Post and Courier, Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said that city's staff modeled the proposed list of essential businesses on recommendations from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nColumbia's measure has a wide array of essential services that are exempted from the stay at home order.\n\nFor instance, in the manufacturing sector, it lists \"food processing, manufacturing agents, including all foods and beverages, chemicals, medical equipment\/instruments, pharmaceuticals, sanitary products, telecommunications, microelectronics\/semi-conductor, agriculture\/farms, household paper products, vehicle and aircraft manufacturing\" as exceptions.\n\nEssential retail operations in the order include \"grocery stores and all food and beverage stores, pet stores that sell food and or medications, big box stores or wholesale clubs that have in-house grocery or pharmacy services, pharmacies, convenience stores, direct farm to consumer sales, gas stations, restaurants\/bars (but only for take-out or\/delivery), hardware and building material store and online retailers that deliver products and services to individual's homes or businesses.\"\n\nBanks, credit unions and check cashing services, insurance, payroll, accounting, services related to financial markets and legal services also are listed among the wave of essential services that could continue operating under the proposed measure.\n\nTo see the full draft order, and list of essential services that are excepted, click here.\n\nRickenmann had reservations about the stay at home order. In a statement sent to Free Times, he said such an order is \"the most drastic action any government can take.\"\n\nHe says he thinks Columbians have been doing a good job social distancing without having a city edict.\n\n\"We\u2019re already two weeks into a drastic shutdown of our economy,\" Rickenmann says. \"To close even more businesses for two more weeks could have devastating impacts on our small businesses that can\u2019t afford to stay closed a month. Many may never re-open. The solution to this crisis is to continue to do what we\u2019re doing well and ask everyone high-risk to stay home. If they don\u2019t have families or neighbors to help buy groceries or get medicine, let\u2019s organize that help. But they need to self-quarantine. That\u2019s critical.\"\n\nMeanwhile, District 2 Councilman Ed McDowell said during the meeting that Council is tasked with considering the \"human loss\" potential of COVID-19, and that public health was at the top of his mind when considering the stay at home order.\n\n\"We are in a human crisis that says, 'We have to do our part,'\" McDowell said.\n\nAs for the police department enforcing the stay at home order, Benjamin said at a Thursday night news conference that the Columbia Police Department would use \"common sense and compassion.\"\n\nBenjamin was also asked about the fact that McMaster has not issued such an order statewide.\n\n\"It's the governor's prerogative,\" the third-term mayor said. \"We have led from the front on this issue. We have not paid attention to political desires or even personal desires. We have followed the data. Good data allows you to make good decisions.\n\n\"We have never seen anything like this in over 100 years in this country. It requires thoughtful public health professionals be listened to, and that elected leaders enact policies that help us slow down the curve and the spread of this virus and save lives. That's our goal here. Hopefully the governor will follow suit. I'm not sure that he will.\"","category":"shelter_in_place","population":2031.0,"lat":45.895,"lng":-122.8115}

The \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d designation means a state or local test showed COVID-19 but the results haven\u2019t been confirmed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOnly two of the four cases in Mecklenburg County had been previously reported. Mecklenburg Health Director Gibbie Harris says two new people who tested positive are isolating in their homes. Their family members are in quarantine, and the county is tracking down personal contacts.\n\nGaston County's declaration, meanwhile, includes restrictions on crowds of 50 or more people, but there are exemptions for businesses. The Gaston County Police Department is asking for voluntary compliance.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s take time and be considerate,\u201d Gaston County Commission Chairman Tracy Philbeck said at a news conference. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to panic. We don\u2019t have to buy all the toilet paper up at Walmart. We don\u2019t have to do those things. Avoid crowds, wash your hands, and think about those in the community who would suffer greatly if we had a spike in coronavirus.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Gov. Roy Cooper issued an order banning events of 100 or more people and closing the state's public schools for at least two weeks. That's led to some concern about how children who rely on school meals will be fed.\n\nIn Gaston's case, Superintendent Jeff Booker said Sunday that the district will start its summer feeding program on Tuesday, allowing parents to get meals for qualifying kids at 10 sites throughout the county.\n\nIn addition to the four cases in Mecklenburg, there's also a likely case in neighboring Cabarrus County and one in Watauga County. With the exception of two cases in Forsyth County, the rest of the confirmed coronavirus cases in North Carolina are in the triangle area and the eastern part of the state.\n\nThere is, however, limited testing capacity in North Carolina. On Friday, Harris said Friday that the county had only received three CDC test kits from the state. Health officials are trying to ration those for folks at the highest risk of contracting the disease.\n\nUniversity and commercial testing is expanding, though. As of Sunday, the North Carolina Health and Human Services was reporting that 259 tests had been completed at the state lab. That number doesn't include tests done by universities or commercial labs.\n\nClick here for the latest coronavirus news on WFAE\u2019s live blog.\n\nSign up here for The Frequency, WFAE\u2019s daily email newsletter.\n\nWhat questions do you have about the coronavirus?

We suspect that the milk snake was an escaped pet and we put the details on Pets Located in the hope an owner will come forward.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very lucky that the bearded dragon was found in time. Exotic pets like bearded dragons aren\u2019t always easy to care for and sadly this does mean we often see them abandoned when their owners struggle to cope with their care which is why we would urge people to thoroughly do their research before taking on any pet.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re struggling, there is never an excuse to abandon an animal like this as there are always other options open to you.\u201d\n\nLast year, RSPCA rescuers dealt with 2,473 welfare incidents across West Sussex.\n\nAlthough RSPCA centres and wildlife centres have closed to the public, the charity continues to provide vital care to thousands of animals across England and Wales during this difficult time, and is expecting even more to come into its care in the coming weeks.\n\nThe charity is also facing a huge financial strain as it is already seeing the damaging effect of this crisis on its fundraising income, while the costs of saving, treating and caring for animals continue.\n\nThe teams are continuing an emergency-only service through the lockdown period.\n\nDermot Murphy, head of the RSPCA rescue teams, said: \u201cThis is a time of national crisis, and many of us are anxious about the future and our loved ones. This crisis has touched all areas of life and the RSPCA is no different. As we all face the biggest challenge of a generation, the RSPCA must continue to be on the frontline, rescuing and caring for the animals who need us most.\n\n\u201cOur rescuers, vets and nurses have been designated key workers by the government which means we can carry on saving animals from cruelty and neglect and we rely entirely on generous public donations to deliver our vital services.\n\n\u201cWe are facing immense challenges and huge pressures on strained resources, but our hugely dedicated teams are out there dealing with emergencies and our centres continue to deliver vital care to thousands of animals, with more expected in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe know that this is a difficult time for everyone but we must still be there for the animals who are suffering and we are appealing for animal lovers to give whatever they can to help us.\u201d\n\nTo help the RSPCA keep rescuing animals and to keep its animal hospitals and centres running for emergency treatment and round the clock care visit www.rspca.org.uk\/covid to donate.\n\nYou can also find information if you\u2019re concerned about caring for a pet amind the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n___\n\nA message from the Editor, Gary Shipton:\n\nThank you for reading this story on our website.\n\nBut I also have an urgent plea to make of you.\n\nIn order for us to continue to provide high quality local news on this free-to-read site and in print, please purchase a copy of our newspaper as well.

Our content is universally trusted - as all independent research proves.\n\nAs Baroness Barran said in a House of Lords debate this week on the importance of journalists: \u201cNot only are they a trusted source of facts, but they will have a role to play in rallying communities and getting the message across about how we can keep ourselves and our families safe, and protect our NHS. Undoubtedly, they have a critical role.\u201d\n\nBut being your eyes and ears comes at a price. So we need your support more than ever to buy our newspapers during this crisis. In return we will continue to forensically cover the local news - not only the impact of the virus but all the positive and uplifting news happening in these dark days.\n\nIn addition, please write to your MP urging the Government to provide some additional financial support for local newspapers and their websites like this one and ensuring that supermarkets continue to stock them.

The rent increase moratorium applies to all residential units in the city, according to Papazian.\n\nCouncil members adopted the moratorium after a stream of residents called in asking city officials to consider rent forgiveness, or what many called a rent freeze, while residents grapple with new unemployment or increased medical bills in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome called for a freeze of mortgages and utility bills as well.\n\nGlendale has 29 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, according to county health officials. The virus has claimed one local resident\u2019s life. Countless others are dealing with jobs lost due to nonessential business closures mandated by the city and county last week.\n\nHaley Hopkins, a 23-year-old Glendale resident, told the council that she lost her job as a self-described blue-collar worker in the arts industry as a result of the pandemic.\n\nAccording to Hopkins, the renter protections offered by the city are not sufficient to meet the crisis at hand, echoing several others who called into the virtual meeting to advocate for rent forgiveness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m truly wondering how any one of you think I\u2019m supposed to pay my rent without being able to earn an income,\u201d Hopkins said during the public comment portion of the meeting.\n\nShe surmised that many residents will have trouble paying back missed rent and that landlords might be able to find loopholes in the rules.\n\nKwak is continuing to work from home as a freelance editor and proofreader but said she lost a part-time contract job with a law firm that was essential for making ends meet.\n\nWhile she has savings to last through April, she worries about what will happen in May if she can\u2019t find a way to supplement her income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExempting struggling residents from rent is not as simple as declaring it so, according to several Glendale officials.\n\nImplementing a rent freeze could violate state law and the Constitution, issues that would need to be addressed before a proposal could be considered, according to Garcia.\n\nIt might take federal action \u2014 such as a one-year mortgage forgiveness or stimulus funding \u2014 to make such a measure feasible, Mayor Ara Najarian said during the meeting.\n\nOn Wednesday, Newsom announced that several major banks and institutions had agreed to a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments.\n\nFamilies should not lose their homes because of COVID-19.

The provisions apply for the duration of the declared State of Emergency. Landlords violating the order risk losing their City of Gresham rental license, which allows them to conduct business in Gresham.\n\n\"This is a substantial measure, but we must protect the stability of our families, and their housing, as a first order of business,\" said Gresham Mayor Shane Bemis. \"Many of our residents are facing drastic economic challenges at the same time that we're asking them to take unprecedented actions. Stabilizing their housing safety, in the short term, is a critical first measure in controlling the spread of the virus. We are all in this together, and we cannot have families displaced during an unprecedented global health pandemic.\"\n\nOn the commercial front, the City Council's action bars commercial property owners from terminating commercial leases for any purpose connected to the declared State of Emergency. Those who violate the moratorium will be denied a license to conduct business at their location for one year following the conclusion of the State of Emergency.\n\n\"Small businesses, collectively, are America's largest employer,\" Bemis said. \"We have spent decades building vibrant, thriving business districts in Gresham with local entrepreneurs who operate on paper-thin margins, but who contribute strongly to our local economy and our sense of community. We will get through this, and emerge on the other side, but we have to take measures now to ensure our local employers get there with us.\"\n\nThe City continues to explore other options and remedies as well to support the housing stability of residents and the viability of local businesses. In addition to taking local action and exploring other local options, the City is urging state and federal actions.\n\n\"We will continue to push the state and federal governments to take swift actions to ensure the public's health and safety, provide enhanced renter protections, mortgage relief, and small business assistance,\" Bemis said.\n\nThe City's Emergency Operations Center remains activated, while City Hall is closed to the public; City leadership continues to conduct core businesses and ensure that essential services are operational for the safety of the public.\n\nRegular updates to the community will be available on GreshamOregon.gov\/COVID19 as well as the City's social media channels.\n\nThis press release was produced by the City of Gresham .

The majority of those cases, 10, are in Washington County.\n\nHillsboro City Manager Robby Hammond has the authority to determine if an emergency exists.

After that, the decision expires after two weeks and can be extended in one-week increments.\n\n\"To be clear, we are not declaring a public health emergency.

About 15% of Orange County\u2019s population of about 3 million is 65 or older, according to U.S. Census estimates as of July 1.

City staff also is meeting with community groups, such as the local interfaith council, to coordinate responses for higher-risk populations, Chi said.\n\n\u201cWe kind of do what we\u2019re doing here, so it\u2019s not so much worried about us getting the flu or me getting the flu, it\u2019s me transmitting it to somebody else who may not have the wherewithal to combat it,\u201d Councilman Mike Posey said.\n\nSupport our coverage by becoming a digital subscriber.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":436.0,"lat":44.3502,"lng":-117.2668}

Photo: Win McNamee\/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s strategy on the coronavirus from the outset has focused relentlessly on the stock market, treating the virus as a partisan plot by Democrats to stoke panic. Trump has, accordingly, issued a series of optimistic and sometimes delusional assessments, in the apparent belief that he can contain the panic through sheer force of propaganda.\n\nAs the virus has spread, this position has grown increasingly untenable. At first, Trump was simply making extremely unlikely predictions about the future, claiming that he prevented the virus from infecting Americans by boldly closing the border. This message worked only until the coronavirus appeared in the U.S. Amazingly, Trump is still hewing to this false talking point.\n\n\u201cThis came unexpectedly, it came out of China, we closed it down, we stopped it, it was a very early shut down,\u201d he told reporters this morning. Trump\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, declared on CNBC, \u201cI would still argue to you that this thing is contained.\u201d\n\nIt is definitely not contained. \u201cContained\u201d means there are a known, finite number of cases, and each one is being confined to a location where it cannot spread. Neither of these conditions is true. Authorities have no idea how many cases there are, due to haphazard testing, but new ones are appearing all over the country, and almost none of them are contained, but instead have been circulating.\n\nOne might be curious why Kudlow has had such a prominent role messaging this issue. He has no expertise in epidemiology. Indeed, he has no expertise in economics, either. What he does have an expertise in is confidently issuing confident predictions on behalf of Republican politicians that may be, and usually are, completely wrong.\n\nAnd since Trump still seems to regard the coronavirus as primarily a stock market problem, he needs Kudlow to go out with the French cuffs and tell Trump\u2019s rich friends that Trump is going to keep making them rich. He urged his audience to buy stocks last week, and then the market fell, to which Kudlow replied that this time they should listen to him and buy, unless maybe they shouldn\u2019t:\n\nCarl Quintanilla tells Larry Kudlow people are annoyed he came on CNBC last week and told people to buy the dip, and now the market has fallen 9 percent more. He asks: Should people buy the dip now. Kudlow: \u201cYes. Yes. Well... I don\u2019t do predictions.\u201d \u2014 Josh Barro (@jbarro) March 6, 2020\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do predictions\u201d is a pretty amazing claim for a person whose whole career is based on making (terrible) predictions (that flatter right-wing economic policy).\n\nEven if enough Republican investors decide to believe Trump and Kudlow and \u201cbuy the dip,\u201d this is not a successful propaganda campaign. The entire objective seems to be managing the day to day fluctuations of the market. The plan has a shelf life of hours. Every new false prediction simply burns whatever is left of their credibility, leaving them with an increasingly silly trail of false promises.","category":"None","population":860.0,"lat":45.6586,"lng":-118.6654}

Take action. Be prepared \u2013 Tillamook County Pioneer","text":"Developed by: Victoria Holt, for the Emergency Volunteer Corps of Nehalem BAy\n\nAt EVCNB our mission is preparedness. That\u2019s never been truer than it is today, when being prepared for the coronavirus pandemic can make a crucial difference in the health of our community.\n\nThere is much more coronavirus infection in Oregon than we know about. A total of 30 cases were diagnosed statewide as of March 12, but fewer than 500 people have been tested, so the true numbers are likely much higher. The state epidemiologist estimated yesterday there are actually 150-250 cases in Oregon, and that number can double each week. That means there will be up to 75,000 cases in our state by mid-May if no changes are made in community practices. Our health care system cannot handle that magnitude of serious and contagious illness.\n\nThe Nehalem Bay area is at risk. We are not an isolated community \u2013 we see numerous visitors from outside the area who frequent our grocery stores, restaurants, and shops. And many of our full-time residents travel frequently. We cannot count on the current apparent absence of disease to protect us.\n\nThe speed at which the coronavirus will spread depends upon a number of factors. One key factor is the contact rate, the rate at which infected individuals come close enough to others to spread the disease. Each person who avoids infection breaks a link in a potential branching transmission chain. By avoiding the infection, we not only avoid passing it to a vulnerable co-worker or an elderly neighbor, we break a chain that could otherwise result in dozens if not hundreds or thousands of cases over time. NOW is the time to take precautions. It will be much more effective now than waiting until the first cases are diagnosed in our community.\n\nWhat can each person in the Nehalem Bay area do now to avoid getting and passing on the coronavirus?\n\nAvoid unnecessary personal contact with other people. If you are employed, work from home if possible. Try to conduct necessary meetings online rather than in person. Do not attend large events (the governor has prohibited gatherings of 250 people or more, but smaller gatherings are a risk as well). If you are over 60 years of age or have ongoing medical conditions, you are at higher risk of serious complications if infected. It\u2019s prudent for those of us in this group to cancel all nonessential travel and stay home as much as possible.\n\nIf you are around other people, practice consistent and strict social distancing: keep a minimum of 6 feet from any other person and don\u2019t shake hands. Avoid anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Don\u2019t share food or eating utensils. Avoid surfaces that may be contaminated, and don\u2019t touch your face.\n\nWash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds frequently and after any contact outside your home, and use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available. Best practices for hand washing!\n\nIf you are sick, stay home and away from other people; especially stay away from those who are over 60 or have ongoing medical conditions. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, using a tissue or the crook of your elbow, not your hand. Call your health care provider or clinic ahead of time if you plan to seek care to get advice about how to proceed. Do not show up unannounced.\n\nThis rapidly changing situation means time is of the essence. We still have the power and the responsibility to make behavior changes than can contribute to coronavirus control. Discuss these precautions with your family, and make sure everyone understands what to do. Now is the time to practice preparedness \u2013 for our own health and that of our community. We can make a difference.\n\nNote about the author: A resident of Manzanita, Victoria Holt is a MPH (Master\u2019s in Public Health) and PhD from University of Washington \u2013 both of these were in Epidemiology.

Carr also questioned the use of the military to conduct quarantine checks, which are then enforced by state law enforcement.\n\nThe delegated legislation committee, which is chaired by the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, resolved to write to ministers warning them that regulations must \u201cbe time limited where it trespasses on personal rights or liberties, or amends, or modifies the operation of, primary legislation\u201d and calling on the government to explain what safeguards are in place.\n\n\u201cParliamentary scrutiny of executive-made laws is essential in critical times like these,\u201d Fierravanti-Wells said.\n\n\u201cBy continuing to scrutinise legislative instruments which would ordinarily be subject to parliamentary oversight, the committee will play its part in ensuring that the government remains accountable to the parliament during this time.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Dreyfus welcomed the government\u2019s decision to recall parliament to pass its $130bn third support package, which includes a new jobkeeper wage subsidy payment.\n\nOn Twitter, the shadow attorney general said Scott Morrison \u201cmust not shut [parliament] down again as soon as he gets what he needs\u201d.\n\nMark Dreyfus (@markdreyfusQCMP) When the Parliament re-convenes, Mr Morrison must not shut it down again as soon as he gets what he needs \u2013 Parliament should continue to sit in some way, shape or form during the current crisis (e.g. with the assistance of technology or with fewer MPs attending in person) 2\/5\n\n\u201cOver the coming months, the Morrison government will make decisions that will have extraordinary consequences for millions of Australians and for the social and economic fabric of our country for at least a generation,\u201d Dreyfus said.\n\n\u201cParliament has given the government emergency powers to respond to this crisis.\n\n\u201cEvery member of the parliament has a role in ensuring that those powers will be exercised in the best interests of their constituents and of our nation.\u201d\n\nMark Dreyfus (@markdreyfusQCMP) Parliament has given the Government emergency powers to respond to this crisis.

I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about.\"\n\nThe president is holding a press conference on Friday afternoon.\n\nNearly 1,700 cases of the flu-like respiratory illness have been confirmed in the US, though health department officials in cities and states across the country believe that number is or will become significantly higher because of the lack of testing abilities. At least 41 people have died.\n\nDemocrats have pressed the administration to make the emergency declaration, which could allow states to request that the federal government share 75 per cent of expenses related to emergency medical care and supplies, among other public health requirements.\n\nBut the president has been wary to tell Americans to take the same health precautions urged by health officials within his own administration, as school systems and major events, including entire professional sports seasons, cancel or suspend all activities under threat of the deadly outbreak. Instead, the president and his allies have blamed subsequent panic on partisan leadership and the media, while economic fears have sent the markets into a tailspin after months of the president relying on a healthy stock market for proof of his legitimacy in office.\n\nIn their response to the president's address to the nation on Wednesday night, Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders on Thursday also pressed Mr Trump to declare a national emergency as they outlined their pitches to respond to the pandemic.\n\nThe president's likely declaration also comes at the urging of hospitals and doctors and nursing groups, including the American Hospital Association and American Medical Association, to help cover the costs of caring for uninsured patients. It also could waive certain Medicare, Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program requirements.\n\nDaily coronavirus briefing No hype, just the advice and analysis you need Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

The travel ban excludes the UK.\n\nThe president said he was \"marshalling the full power of the federal government\" to confront the outbreak.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":1992.0,"lat":45.3786,"lng":-122.6822}

We learned a lot from H1N1 over a decade ago and already had plans and supplies in place for this type of event,\" City Manager Greg Dirks said Thursday. \"We implemented increased cleanings and hand sanitizer at the door (at the city's temporary City Hall offices off of Northeast Halsey Street) over two weeks ago, and stressed the importance to staff of staying at home if feeling ill.\"\n\nWood Village city officials have focused on ensuring essential operations like water and sewer services can continue to operate.\n\n\"We have a smaller staff at Wood Village, and we have a duty and obligation to ensure that regardless of how this pandemic evolves, the people and businesses of Wood Village have safe, clean drinking water, and running sewer systems,\" Greg Dirks said.\n\nWood Village Mayor Harden emphasized the importance of precautions issued by the Oregon Health Authority and federal health officials, including:\n\nn Washing hands often with soap and water.

In Bucks County, the Central Bucks School District said it will reopen schools Monday after a coronavirus-related scare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMontgomery County Commissioners on Sunday issued an emergency disaster declaration, as the number of county residents presumed positive for the coronavirus rose to four.\n\nCommissioners Chairwoman Dr. Valerie Arkoosh said the declaration was being done \"in an abundance of caution\" to give the county greater access to supplies and emergency resources so officials can prepare for what is assumed will be more cases of COVID-19.\n\n\"We want to make sure we\u2019re fully prepared,\" Arkoosh said. \"We fully expect we will see additional cases here in Montgomery County.\"\n\nHours after the press conference, the state health department announced two new adult cases in the county. A Lower Merion couple have mild symptoms and are currently in isolation at home, the county said.\n\nThey were both exposed to the virus while traveling out of the country to an area where COVID-19 is present, officials said.\n\nNo cases have been announced in Bucks County, and Central Bucks officials said Sunday that schools would reopen Monday, after a coronavirus-related scare forced the closure of five schools and the deep cleaning of all 23 schools in the district over the weekend.\n\nIn Montgomery County, the two earlier adult patients also have mild symptoms and were isolated in their homes. The first two patients were exposed to the virus after traveling to other states where the virus is present. One is from Lower Gwynedd, and the other Worcester Township, county officials said.\n\nArkoosh said earlier Sunday the first two patients were cooperating with county and state health officials who are tracing any contacts the two had with the public, including places they visited. Officials confirmed Sunday night the same protocols are being taken with the newest patients.\n\nThe county will not be identifying individuals who test presumed positive, but will notify municipal officials where residents test positive.\n\nThe county has not said how long the infected residents have been ill or when symptoms first appeared, other than the first two cases fell within the incubation period, which is two to 14 days.\n\n\"At this point, (residents) are still at very low risk of contracting coronavirus here in Montgomery County because we have not seen any community transmission,\" she said.\n\nThe U.S. death toll from the virus has climbed to at least 19, with all but three victims in Washington state. The number of infections swelled to more than 400, scattered across the U.S.\n\nAbout 80% of people who contract the virus experience mild symptoms. The elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at highest risk for complications. On Sunday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams noted that the average age of death for people from the coronavirus is 80, while for those needing medical attention, it is 60.\n\nHealth officials urge residents to remain calm but continue to frequently wash their hands and avoid touching their face. Elderly residents and others considered at high risk of developing complications from the respiratory virus are also encouraged to avoid crowds if possible.\n\nOn Sunday commissioner Vice Chairman Ken Lawrence urged employers that do not offer paid time off to do their part to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n\"For the public good, if our employers could work with employees and temporarily offer paid sick leave, that would be a tremendous help,\" he said.\n\nSo far, six presumed positive cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Pennsylvania, according to state officials. The other cases are in Delaware and Wayne counties.\n\nCoronavirus is a family of viruses that include the common cold and can cause respiratory illnesses like pneumonia. Transmission occurs via respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing or touching a surface that has come in contact with the droplets.\n\nIn Central Bucks, five schools closed Friday after county and state health officials informed the district that a group of residents may have been exposed to the virus during an informal gathering attended by an out-of-state resident who had the illness, but did not know it.\n\nOn Sunday, after no evidence of the virus was discovered in those who were exposed, the district announced it would re-open schools on a regular schedule. All schools and buses were cleaned over the weekend with anti-microbial products, and the district would continue to employ deep-cleaning practices, district officials said.\n\n\"We are aware of the heightened anxiety and concern that is present in and around our community,\" Superintendent John Kopicki said. \"We understand and respect the concerns of our families and will continue to base our decisions on facts, while working in consultation with local and state experts.\"\n\nKopicki said the district \"received advice and information\" from Bucks County Emergency Management, the Pennsylvania Health Department, Doylestown Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"These experts have all advised us that our best defense is to control personal transmission through good hygiene, proper handwashing, and staying home when sick,\" he said.\n\nCoronavirus fears also led to the cancellation of a planned trip to France next month for the Pennsbury High School marching band due to a rise in cases there. Previously, the band had planned to go to China, then chose Paris because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMontgomery County previously canceled its Manu-Fest and More expo, set for March 10, out of caution.\n\nBoth the Methacton and Wissahickon school districts said the residents who were presumed positive had no interaction with district schools, which will open as scheduled Monday.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":6236.0,"lat":41.1709,"lng":-76.874}

Please join your neighbors and become a subscribing member today\n\nWith the number coronavirus cases in the county steadily climbing, the city of Palo Alto on Thursday declared a state of emergency, joining a growing number of jurisdictions preparing for the impacts of the spreading pandemic.\n\nThe proclamation of the emergency by City Manager Ed Shikada comes days after the city canceled more than 30 events, including town halls and civic ceremonies, to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The city has already canceled most of its public meetings and planned ceremonies, consistent with Santa Clara County's recommendations to encourage \"social distancing.\"\n\nShikada also introduced numerous measures on Thursday aimed to limit face-to-face customer service interaction between the public and staff, including encouraging residents to call, email or make appointments with staff (the full list of changes is available here).\n\nShikada emphasized in a statement that the city \"will continue to provide essential services and community support through thoughtful planning for several impact scenarios during this time of heightened public health risk.\"\n\n\"This is a fast-changing situation, and service changes may continue to evolve,\" Shikada said in the announcement. \"We have already taken several steps to slow the spread of respiratory viruses, including limited public gatherings according to the public health department's guidance. ...\"\n\nThe Thursday declaration, as well as the new measures, intend to provide Palo Alto with \"flexibility in how we can respond to this changing crisis,\" Mayor Adrian Fine announced Thursday. The emergency declaration, he said, will help Emergency Services personnel \"secure vital supplies, funding and assistance.\" Emergency declarations allow local jurisdictions to activate their emergency plans and become eligible for reimbursements from federal and state governments.\n\nPalo Alto is one of many jurisdictions declaring a state of emergency, which comes the same day that Mountain View made a similar move and a day after the city of Santa Clara made its declaration. San Francisco and Santa Clara County previously declared a state of emergency in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nMore than 20 states, including New York, California and Washington, had also announced a state of emergency to combat coronavirus.\n\nShikada also announced on Thursday a series of service changes, most of which will take effect on March 16. Rinconada Pool was closed as of Thursday, the temporary Junior Museum and Zoo was set to close on March 13, and all Children's Theatre performances were postponed until June. Local libraries are disabling some computers to ensure \"social distancing\" between users and Development Center will only be accessible by appointment.\n\nThe City has discontinued police public tours and police and fire ride-a-longs and sit-a-longs. Patrol operations are also being modified for non-emergency police calls for service that can be completed via phone or video. Officers plan to limit face-to-face public contact and ensure social distancing of six feet when possible.\n\nOther services that are typically provided over the counter, including revenue collections, and Residential Parking Permit programs, will now be offered by appointment, as well as by phone, email and online. And residents looking to attend Monday's meeting of the City Council are encouraged to instead submit their comments via email (those should be sent to city.council@cityofpaloalto.org) and to watch the live broadcast of the meetings rather than appearing in-person.\n\nResidents who still want to attend are asked to sit at least six feet away from other people, to avoid shaking hands and to wait until the podium is clear to speak.\n\nFind comprehensive coverage on the Midpeninsula's response to the new coronavirus by Palo Alto Online, the Mountain View Voice and Almanac here.\n\n---\n\nFollow the Palo Alto Weekly\/Palo Alto Online on Twitter @PaloAltoWeekly and Facebook for breaking news, local events, photos, videos and more.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":988.0,"lat":40.6861,"lng":-76.1699}

On Tuesday alone, 14 deaths were reported in the state, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nAD\n\nIndeed, on the covid-19 nationwide map maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state of Florida just turned dark brown, the color signifying more than 5,000 cases. It\u2019s now in the company of California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and New Jersey as of Monday, the cutoff of CDC map data with Louisiana having crossed the 5,000 threshold Tuesday.\n\nOf those states, however, Florida had been the only one not under a statewide \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order. DeSantis has until now urged people in Southeast Florida to remain at home and said this week he would issue a \u201csafer at home\u201d order codifying that advice.\n\nAD\n\nEven Tuesday, DeSantis said at a news conference that he had no plans to issue a statewide order because the White House had not told him to do so.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in contact\u201d with the White House coronavirus task force, he said at a news conference, \u201cand I\u2019ve said, \u2018Are you recommending this?\u2019 The task force has not recommended that to me,\u201d he added. \u201cIf any of those task force folks tell me that we should do X, Y or Z, of course, we\u2019re going to consider it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFor this, he won praise from President Trump who called him \u201ca great governor who knows exactly what he\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nJUST IN: When asked about Gov.

Previously, he had briefed reporters crammed into a small room despite requests on March 20 from the state\u2019s largest newspapers.\n\nAD\n\nMary Ellen Klas, Tallahassee bureau chief for the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times, was barred from a DeSantis news conference last week after requesting social distancing.\n\nDeSantis\u2019s approach to the pandemic has attracted criticism since at least mid-March, when he said it was up to local governments, rather than him, to mandate closing of beaches filled with spring breakers.\n\nDeSantis again pleaded powerlessness at his news conference and wondered how useful orders would be anyway. For example, he said he had closed some beaches at the request of local officials and people were gathering on them anyway.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI was flying out of Miami yesterday,\u201d he said, \u201clooking at beaches with signs saying they were closed.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWere there people out there?

People are allowed to exercise outside while staying six-feet apart, though groups of 10 or more are impermissible, the order said.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":4198.0,"lat":18.3643,"lng":-66.5611}

After originating in China late last year, the disease has now led to several cases in the U.S., including several deaths. Officials are urging people to take precautions to avoid getting sick, and to avoid spreading the disease if they do contract it. Click the drop-down icon on this card for more on the virus and what you should do to keep yourself and those around you healthy. What is coronavirus? Coronavirus is an infection of the respiratory system similar to the flu. Coronaviruses are a class of viruses that regularly cause illnesses among adults and children, but this outbreak has spawned a new disease called COVID-19, a particularly harsh respiratory condition that can lead to death. Health officials believe COVID-19 spread from animals to humans somewhere in China. The CDC believes the virus is now spreading through communities in some affected geographic areas. It spreads among humans by physical person-to-person contact, including via coughs. That\u2019s why health officials urge sick individuals to avoid contact with other people. For more information, visit the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What are the symptoms? Symptoms are similar to the flu and include fever, coughing and shortness of breath. How can I stop the spread of the coronavirus? Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, and cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. If you develop symptoms similar to the coronavirus, you should seek medical attention. Stay home from work or school and avoid contact with others. It can take up to 14 days after coming into contact with the virus to develop symptoms. COVID-19 is a new condition and there\u2019s much about the disease we still don\u2019t understand. For now, taking precautions is the best way to stop the spread of the coronavirus.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":21085.0,"lat":32.2135,"lng":-80.9316}

One of the cases resulted in the state\u2019s first coronavirus-caused death, an elderly person in Lexington County.\n\n\u201cWe emphasize the importance of practicing disease prevention measures and following recommendations for social distancing to protect our community as a whole,\u201d Dr. Brannon Traxler, a DHEC physician consultant, said in a news release.\n\nThe release said people with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath should call their healthcare provider. If an individual doesn\u2019t have a primary care physician, several health care systems are providing telehealth services so residents may be evaluated by a provider without having to leave their homes.\n\nIf it\u2019s determined an individual should be tested, they will be instructed where to go to be tested. Individuals with minor illness are advised not to go to emergency departments, the release said.\n\nBeaufort Memorial Hospital posted a news release Sunday asking for patients or loved ones to call ahead in the event that they have a fever, cough and shortness of breath.\n\n\u201cYour doctor's office will ask you a few questions and then give you appropriate instructions, which may include coming to their office for care or reporting to another site to receive rapid influenza and strep tests,\u201d the post said.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, patients may be asked to wait in their cars while a medical provider administers and processes the tests. Patients may be given additional instructions to receive Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) testing.\u201d\n\nPatients must have a physician\u2019s order before receiving a COVID-19 test.\n\nPatients who are sick and concerned about COVID-19 can initiate a video visit with a provider using the BMH Care Anywhere app.\n\nOver the weekend, the hospital opened a drive-thru testing site for patients who have a physician order for a COVID-19 test.\n\nThe testing site near the Beaufort Memorial Medical and Administrative Center at 990 Ribaut Rd. in Beaufort is directly across from the hospital. It will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 1-5 p.m. Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, hospital representatives did not provide comment when asked for an update regarding the status of four staff members who were in self-quarantine after having contact with two people undergoing testing for the coronavirus.\n\nSpokesperson Courtney McDermott said Saturday the hospital would not confirm if the Beaufort County cases were among those it sent to DHEC for testing.\n\nThe hospital has the following visitor restrictions in place:\n\n\u2022 Only immediate family members over age 18 are allowed to visit patients.\n\n\u2022 Only one visitor per patient is allowed. Additional visitors should not come to the hospital.\n\n\u2022 Groups of visitors \u201ctaking turns\u201d in and out of a patient\u2019s room will not be permitted.\n\n\u2022 Visitors with any symptoms of illness will not be allowed to visit patients or patient care areas.\n\nThe restrictions will remain in place until further notice.\n\nHilton Head Regional Healthcare currently has similar restrictions in place:\n\n\u2022 No visits from children under the age of 18.\n\n\u2022 Visitation is limited to one visitor per patient.\n\n\u2022 No visits from people with fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath.\n\n\u2022 No visits to any patient who is being tested or has a confirmed case of COVID-19.\n\nFor prevention, the public is reminded to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs with an elbow, stay home when sick, don\u2019t attend public gatherings, and appropriately dispose tissues and other items with germs on them.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":21085.0,"lat":32.2135,"lng":-80.9316}

Not yet, at least.\n\nMayor Keith Summey said the city isn\u2019t planning to issue a stay-at-home order and will yield to the state on the matter.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster said he has no plans to issue a stay-at-home order, although Tuesday he issued a directive just shy of that mandate. He ordered closure of all businesses deemed by the state as nonessential.\n\nThe impacts of the order, which permits retail stores to stay open, will be felt in North Charleston.\n\nCity spokesman Ryan Johnson said several stores had already begun implementing safe practices through outdoor pickup stations before the governor\u2019s mandate.\n\nBest Buy had set up a pick-up station outside the store where shoppers could receive items that had been purchased online. Walmart shoppers can also pick up grocery orders outside the store.\n\n\"We always encourage that,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSome, like North Charleston resident Jessica Douglas, agree with the mayor\u2019s approach and said it should be left up to individuals to make decisions about safe practices.\n\nDouglas stood Monday near the banks of the Northwoods Community Park lagoon. Given the fact the park gates were open, she didn\u2019t realize that the city had declared municipal parks officially closed more than a week ago. An administrative assistant for the Medical University of South Carolina, she\u2019s been working from home for three weeks and came outside for some fresh air.\n\nShe said she understands the need for safety precautions to help reduce the spread of the virus. But one\u2019s spiritual beliefs can help guide a person toward making the decisions that they feel is best, she said.\n\n\u201cI just have faith this will be well,\u201d Douglas said.\n\nFollowing the state\n\nSummey said at a press conference Tuesday the city plans on asking the state for help in areas such as funding and National Guard presence in the event a statewide stay-at-home order is issued.\n\n\u201cWe will follow the guidelines that the state gives us because, eventually, we will be asking the state for assistance,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cWe feel we have to comply with the regulations they give us in order to get that assistance when we need it.\u201d\n\nThe virus has heavily hit urban areas nationwide. North Charleston boasts more than 110,000 residents and is adjacent to other heavily populated municipalities.\n\nThe disease has also hit African Americans harder in the Palmetto State. Thirty-nine percent of the state\u2019s coronavirus patients are African American as of March 25, the latest data available; the state\u2019s black population is 27 percent.\n\nThe cities of Charleston and Columbia passed stay-home orders last week, and Mount Pleasant on Tuesday, mandating non-essential businesses to close and placing restrictions on residents\u2019 activities.\n\nThe orders had maintained broad exemptions allowing essential businesses such as grocery stores, pharmacies and gas stations to stay open.\n\nDecisions over who could implement stay-home orders caused confusion over the weekend after S.C. Attorney General Alan Wilson issued an opinion Friday stating only the governor, not counties or cities, can order residents to stay at home during an emergency.\n\nSign up for our new health newsletter The best of health, hospital and science coverage in South Carolina, delivered to your inbox weekly. Email\n\nSign Up!\n\nWhen asked if North Charleston thinks other municipalities had jumped the gun, Johnson said it wasn\u2019t North Charleston\u2019s place to decide.\n\nCouncilman Ron Brinson said he thinks the mandate is in \"(the mayor's) toolbox\" and feels Summey will make a decision around stay-at-home orders when the time is right.\n\nSome municipal leaders feel the governor should issue the statewide mandate.\n\n\u201cQuite frankly, I think the governor should just do it,\u201d said Goose Creek Mayor Greg Habib. \u201cI don't think people are taking the threat seriously enough. An order from the governor gives us some wherewithal to address the problem.\u201d\n\nFrom the city\u2019s side of things, North Charleston has adjusted city operations through April 26 in response to the virus.\n\nPolice and fire personnel continue to operate normally, with police practicing social distancing by standing outside and apart during morning briefings.\n\nThe city is also asking businesses to engage in safety and social distancing practices, such as limiting occupancy to 50 percent allowable by code.\n\nThe city said people have largely been adhering to the governor\u2019s orders, including not gathering in crowds larger than three persons and closing dine-in services. Police Chief Reggie Burgess said the city hasn\u2019t had to arrest or cite anyone for violating McMaster\u2019s directives.\n\n\u201cWe feel our people are complying very well,\u201d Summey said.\n\nImpacts on stores\n\nLowe\u2019s near Wescott remained opened to shoppers Monday, while also encouraging safe practices. In the store\u2019s garden center, check-out lanes were marked to encourage social distancing.\n\nNancy Stone, an emergency room nurse, said she has mixed-feelings about stay-at-home orders. She said outdoor spaces like beaches and businesses like Lowe\u2019s that offer open-air venues should be allowed to remain open because they are beneficial for people\u2019s mental health.\n\nLocal governments have to consider people\u2019s mental and physical health, she said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a nice balance you need to have,\u201d she said.\n\nWalmart on Rivers Avenue has adjusted hours to 7 a.m.-8:30 p.m. daily, with shopping hours for seniors each Tuesday from 6-7 a.m. The store had markers on the floor encouraging shoppers to stay 6 feet apart and hand sanitizers were stationed at the entrance.\n\nEmpty shelves stood in the paper and cleaning products aisles. Some shoppers pushed carts wearing rubber gloves and face masks.\n\nAngie Martin, a teacher, is adjusting to the crisis by using vegetables and seafood in place of other food items.\n\n\u201cChicken has been very hard to find,\u201d she said.\n\nAt Bertha's Kitchen in Union Heights, store operators have adjusted hours and installed safety shields in takeout lines. Linda Pinckney, who co-owns the store, estimated that sales have been cut in half. The store has let go four part-time employees to cut back on costs.\n\n\"It's hurt our business tremendously,\" she said.\n\nThomas Novelly and Andy Shain contributed to this report.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":616085.0,"lat":32.8151,"lng":-79.963}

The matter of how to conduct that business, and who can attend, presents a challenge.\n\nOn Monday afternoon Chester County Council meets for a 3 p.m. special called meeting at council chambers. The meeting is closed to the public due to limits on public gathering from COVID-19. The council meeting will live stream on the county Facebook page.\n\nChester County restricted access to its public buildings on March 23. Now the county plans to suspend it usual operating rules for 60 days due to coronavirus.\n\nThe Monday afternoon meeting March 30 includes an update on coronavirus impacts in the county, a new rule to allow electronic meetings, a state of emergency declaration and legal advice on the coronavirus impact on tax and fee collection.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nEventually, though, counties have to face non-coronavirus tasks that typically \u2014 and by law \u2014 would be public gatherings. Chester County next meets April 6.\n\nLancaster County faces similar issues. Its council meeting on March 23 proceeded under what then was Gov. Henry McMaster\u2019s order to limit gatherings of more than 50 people. The county took online citizen comment prior. Council doesn\u2019t broadcast its meetings, but live streamed that March 23 meeting via Facebook.\n\n\u201cWe also voted to only have one meeting next month (April 27),\u201d said Councilman Brian Carnes. \u201cState law requires at least one meeting per month.\n\nCouncil would\u2019ve met again in Lancaster County on April 14, two days after Easter. The two-week delay could change how the next meeting operates. Recommendations could be what they are now \u2014 McMaster called for no public gatherings of three or more outside of work on March 23 \u2014 or could become more severe. They are less likely to loosen.\n\nEarlier this month President Donald Trump spoke of a desire to ease social distancing guidelines by Easter. In a press briefing March 29, though, Trump noted the peak for coronavirus deaths in this country could be two weeks out and guidelines will extend through the end of April.\n\n\u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won,\u201d he said. \u201cThat would be the greatest loss of all.\u201d\n\nYork County Council met for its own special called meeting March 26. Council declared a public health emergency and changed its meeting rules, allowing for fewer and virtual meetings without public attendance. Council will meet once monthly. Already the planned April 6 meeting was canceled, as was an April 9 zoning board of appeals meeting.\n\nYork County already has an established system for live streaming meetings on its own website, and on Youtube. Online public access will continue for council meetings, though they may be held using audio sources. New rules in York County, too, will last 60 days.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":9039.0,"lat":34.705,"lng":-81.2132}

Cuomo calls it \u2018federal declaration of war\u2019\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014President Donald Trump said Saturday that he may order an \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d for New York City and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut \u2014prompting surprise and shock from New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\u201cThis would be an enforceable quarantine. And, you know, I\u2019d rather not do it, but we may need it,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCuomo likened such a quarantine to a \u201cfederal declaration of war\u201d on the city and state. \u201cIt would be chaos and mayhem. \u2026 I don\u2019t think it is plausible. I don\u2019t think it is legal,\u201d he said hours later on CNN.\n\nSuch an order would be the most sweeping move so far in the effort to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States.

J.B. Pritzker says an infant with COVID-19 has died and an investigation is underway to determine the cause of death.\n\nOfficials didn\u2019t release other information about the infant, who was from Cook County, which includes Chicago, including whether the child had other health issues.\n\nThe risk of death and severe illness from COVID-19 is greater for older adults and people with other health problems. In most cases, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization.\n\nChildren have made up a small fraction of coronavirus cases worldwide. A letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Chinese researchers earlier this month reported the death of a 10-month-old with COVID-19. The infant had a bowel blockage and organ failure, and died four weeks after being hospitalized.\n\nSeparate research published in the journal Pediatrics traced 2,100 infected children in China and noted one death, a 14-year old.

Ron DeSantis, a Republican and close ally of President Donald Trump, tells reporters he had spoken with the president about the possibility of a coronavirus quarantine for the New York City area.\n\nDeSantis says Florida will soon set up a checkpoint along Interstate 95 to screen travellers from that area, similar to one already in place along Interstate 10 to screen people from Louisiana. Many airports in Florida also are screening travellers from certain areas, requiring travellers to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\n\u201cI think whatever works is what we need to do,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cWe\u2019re either fighting the virus or we\u2019re not.

He says Wilson\u2019s Friday opinion is \u201cincorrect on a constitutional and statutory basis.\u201d\n\nItaly frees up $400 million euros for food coupons and food aid\n\nROME \u2014 Three weeks into national containment measures that have shut down most shops and non-essential industry, many Italians are hurting for food money during the lockdown amid the country\u2019s devastating COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nItalian Premier Giuseppe Conte told the nation he has signed a decree freeing up 400 million euros ($440 million) for food coupons and packages of food aid. Volunteers from Italy\u2019s national Civil Protection agency will bring food to those who must stay at home because they are in quarantine or ill with the coronavirus.\n\nConte appealed to large supermarket chains to give discounts of 5-10% to people presenting the special coupons. Said Conte: \u201cPeople are suffering psychologically, they\u2019re not used to staying in their homes. But they are also suffering economically.\u201d\n\nConte declined to say when the lockdown could be ended or eased.\n\nGermany: 12 die in nursing home\n\nBERLIN \u2014 Twelve residents of a nursing home in northern Germany have died after being infected with the coronavirus.\n\nAuthorities say the 12 residents of the home in Wolfsburg died since Monday, news agency dpa reported. Mayor Klaus Mohrs said several hadn\u2019t shown symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nLocal officials said 72 of the roughly 165 residents had been infected with the coronavirus, and they were separated from those who tested negative.\n\nAnother nursing home in the southern German city of Wuerzburg also has reported 12 deaths.\n\nGermany has confirmed more than 56,000 infections with the coronavirus, including 403 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. That is a lower death rate than in many other countries.\n\nFirst coronavirus deaths in Rhode Island\n\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 Rhode Island announced its first two deaths from the coronavirus on the same day that the state National Guard was expected to go door to door in coastal communities to find visitors from New York.\n\nOne person in their 80s died Friday night, the other person in their 70s died Saturday, the state Department of Health said.\n\nThere are now only three states with zero reported deaths: Hawaii, West Virginia and Wyoming.\n\nThe Guard was said to be asking people if they are visiting from New York and telling them about the mandatory 14-day quarantine for people from the state. The measure is needed to help control the spread of the new coronavirus because the New York City area is the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S., Gov. Gina Raimondo said Friday.\n\nSpain: Future of the EU is at stake\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says the future of the European Union is at stake if it fails to make a vigorous, united response to the coronavirus outbreak devastating the bloc\u2019s southern flank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Europe\u2019s time to act. Europe is at risk,\u201d Sanchez says in a nationally televised address.\n\nSanchez says the EU could not repeat the hard-love austerity strategy it employed during the 2008 recession when countries like Greece and Portugal were forced to request a bailout and slash their budgets.\n\nHe calls for a \u201cnew Marshall Plan\u201d to help lighten the burden on the hardest-hit countries and cushion the inevitable blow coming from the drop in economic activity.\n\nItaly and Spain lead the world in deaths reported from the virus with more than 15,000 between them.\n\nSpain: Commuting ban starts Monday\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced his government will order a two-week ban on commuting to all non-essential businesses starting on Monday.\n\nSanchez says in a publicly televised address that all workers are ordered to remain at home \u201cas if it were a weekend\u201d to \u201cintensify\u201d efforts to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus.\n\nSpain is approaching the end of the second week of stay-at-home rules and the closing of most stores, but workers were allowed to go to offices and factories if they were unable to work from home.\n\nSpain reported 832 deaths Saturday for a total of 5,690 fatalities, to go with 72,248 infections. Its health authorities say, however, that the rate of infection growth appears to be slowing.\n\nNew Orleans one of U.S.\u2019s COVID-19 hot spots\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2014 New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell\u2019s administration is asking for donations of protective equipment.\n\nThe donations can be dropped off at Salvation Army drop boxes next to New Orleans Fire Department stations. Items being accepted include masks, gloves, disposable medical gowns, goggles and face shields.\n\n\u201cLike many places around the world, orders of PPE equipment made back in November 2019 have yet to be filled and our supply is running low. Any additional equipment the public can donate at this time will help keep our first responders safe and out on the streets,\u201d New Orleans Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness Director Collin Arnold said.\n\nNew Orleans is one of the nation\u2019s hot spots for coronavirus.\n\nItaly\u2019s COVID-19 deaths reduce slightly from previous day\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s COVID-19 deaths are down slightly from the previous day.\n\nCivil Protection officials said there were 889 deaths in a 24-hour period ending Saturday evening in the country, where intensive care units have been overwhelmed at the heart of the outbreak in the north.

Fire and public safety will continue.\n\nThe city council meeting for Monday is also canceled and plans are being made to do remote meetings with public comment in the future. Planning commission and other committee meetings will be canceled.\n\n\u201cDeclaring a state of emergency allows us to tweak our operations to face the challenges of this virus,\u201d City Administrator Adam Emrick said. \u201cWe hope this is an overreaction but we\u2019ve learned the only way to limit this thing is to be overreacting.\u201d\n\nYouth sports could be postponed on Monday depending on what the school board decides. Council Member William Goldfinch said ideally he would like to find a way to keep outside sports open to give folks something to do.\n\n\u201cIt gives these kids a chance to get out there and run around,\u201d Goldfinch said. \u201cHow long is this going to go on?

Henry McMaster's executive orders.\n\nLocal closings and updates: Schools | Colleges | Grocery stores | Churches | Businesses & Events | Restaurants | Malls | Hospitals]\n\nLast week, the city had intended to pass its own ordinance similar to Charleston and Columbia and some coastal towns \u2014 but backed off after state Attorney General Alan Wilson issued an opinion saying such laws leave municipalities under threat of a legal action.\n\nMcMaster has yet to order a statewide decree ordering people to stay at home, despite mounting calls to do so.\n\nOn Monday, 151 new cases of COVID-19 were reported by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control, bringing the total number of cases statewide to 925 across 41 counties. Eighteen have died, and among them was Anderson County's first reported death. Greenville County saw 17 new reported cases Monday.\n\nIn the U.S., there were more than 160,000 cases as of Monday afternoon and nearly 3,000 deaths.\n\n\"According to the CDC and local public health officials, this is the critical period to stop the virus from spreading,\" White told The News. \"It\u2019s here. A large metro area like Greenville absolutely must double down now to keep the virus under control.\"\n\nThe ordinance, published in draft form this afternoon (see below), allows for people to go out to exercise so long as it can be done with six feet of distance and doesn't involve shared equipment.\n\nGolf courses can stay open. Gyms, dance studios, bowling alleys and other indoor entertainment cannot.\n\nNon-essential services not listed as part of the ordinance (see full list of eligible activities) would be allowed but not if they require less than six feet of distance, which makes cutting hair or painting nails impossible.\n\nThe ban on dine-in service continues, though take out, curbside and delivery are still allowed.\n\nThe ordinance doesn't prevent someone from traveling out of the city for a non-essential purpose.\n\nMore: Greenville to 're-evaluate' proposed COVID-19 stay-at-home order in light of Attorney General opinion\n\nFor more than a week, the mayor has signaled his desire for \"personal services\" businesses that aren't essential to close but has had not authority to do so absent the governor taking action.\n\nThe ordinance would specify that keeping a six foot distance, as suggested by the CDC, is required by law. This would include grocery stores and home improvement stores that have seen a rush of business but have had inconsistent measures to ensure distancing.\n\n\"Many people have weighed in over the past days,\" White said. \"None more persuasive than health care professionals, nurses and doctors, who reside in great numbers in our city\u2019s neighborhoods. They need our support and are asking specifically for this kind of action.\"\n\nThe issue of local stay-at-home orders has turned into a political football in the past several days. Urban leaders have begged the governor to enact a statewide order, just as the cities and the state of North Carolina have. Today, U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, who has the COVID-19 virus, pleaded for McMaster to act.\n\nMcMaster has said he believes he has acted adequately to address the spread and based his decisions on science, data and advice of health experts.\n\nThe rural areas of the state haven't pushed hard for any stay-at-home orders. Greenville County Council Chairman Butch Kirven said that the governor's actions have sufficed, which he said is seen in the behavior of citizens who have generally followed the governor's direction.\n\nThe attorney general's opinion last week sent doubt throughout communities that enacted their own ordinances. Coastal towns like Folly Beach rescinded their measures on Friday for fear of being sued by the state and implored McMaster take action. By Saturday, Folly Beach had reinstated its restrictions after people flocked to the shore.\n\nColumbia and Charleston pledged to forge ahead with their ordinances, which the city of Greenville essentially copied.\n\nOn Sunday, Wilson's office issued a clarification stating that while a private citizen could sue a municipality or county, the opinion didn't go so far as to say a local government couldn't continue to enforce ordinances unless a court ordered otherwise.\n\nSee the full list of essential businesses here:\n\nCheck back for updates on this developing story.\n\nFollow Eric on Twitter @cericconnor\n\nRead or Share this story: https:\/\/www.greenvilleonline.com\/story\/news\/local\/greenville\/downtown\/2020\/03\/30\/coronavirus-greenville-stay-home-require-6-feet-distance-close-nonessential-business\/5089580002\/","category":"shelter_in_place","population":467894.0,"lat":34.8362,"lng":-82.3649}

Gov. Henry McMaster declared a Covid-19 state of emergency two weeks ago, a law went into effect that makes looting a felony, Faris said.\n\n\u201cThere is a state of emergency law in effect and this looting incident was charged under that emergency law,\u201d Faris said. \u201cThe law is in place to protect the public and their property during this emergency.\u201d\n\nUnder the South Carolina emergency law, it is illegal to \u201center into the property of another, without lawful authority and with criminal intent; damage the property of another; or take possession or otherwise disturb the property of another in any manner.\u201d\n\nA person violating a provision of this item is guilty of a felony and must be fine or sent to prison or both, state law shows. The length of the sentence is to be determined by a judge if there is a conviction, the law states.\n\nThe emergency looting law falls under the same law where local law enforcement has the authority to break up any gathering of more than three people, Faris said.\n\nThe two men were found around 4 a.m. Friday outside storage warehouse units in the 4500 block of Charlotte Highway in Lake Wylie, according to a sheriff\u2019s office incident report. Deputies recovered items and a stolen truck, according to the report.\n\nIn addition to the looting charges, Miller faces 23 other charges including burglary, larceny, conspiracy, and possession of burglary tools. He is jailed under a $153,500 bond.\n\nOsczepinski is charged with 25 crimes other than looting, including burglary, possession of a stolen vehicle, larceny, possession of burglary tools, and conspiracy. He is being held in the York County jail under a $141,500 bond.\n\nOsczepinski has previous convictions in North Carolina for armed robbery, according to the N.C.

Photo by Jesse Altilio\/City Times\n\nThe San Diego Community College District Board of Trustees held a meeting on Thursday, March 12 at the SDCCD offices in Mission Valley.\n\nThe board voted unanimously to declare an emergency due to COVID-19 and authorized Chancellor Constance Carroll to take action even between board meetings, enabling her to stay on top of this rapidly evolving situation.\n\nThe board made it clear they are doing everything in their power to ensure that all SDCCD students are kept safe and able to continue attending class, including those without computers and internet access, but Carroll said that they cannot make a decision on whether to stay open at this time.\n\n\u201cThe resolution \u2026 before the board today does two things,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cIt would have the board declare an emergency within our district, which will be very helpful in our planning and recognizing the actual situation for what it is.\n\n\u201cSecond, assigning to the chancellor authority to take action between board meetings that may be necessary to keep people safe.\u201d\n\nThis evening, the @sdccd Board of Trustees held a special meeting and declared an emergency due to the coronavirus situation and authorized the chancellor to take actions to manage the district\u2019s response including ensuring continuity of operations and instruction. #StudentsFirst pic.twitter.com\/YwtH1B4K50 \u2014 Jack Beresford (@SDJackB) March 13, 2020\n\nThe meeting addressed various topics concerning SDCCD schools, including the rapidly developing situation with COVID-19.\n\nThe Associated Students Government raised concerns about uncertainties around classes. Speaking to the board, City College ASG Senator Keith Dolderer questioned whether the decision to temporarily move students to online classes would have exceptions for students and faculty who wish to continue attending school on campus.\n\n\u201cIf some of the teachers and the students request to continue to go to campus, is there a way to implement some kind of waiver form that would allow students and faculty, given that everyone is in agreeance within whatever classroom, to be able to attend classes there? This was brought up to me by many students,\u201d Dolderer said.\n\nMesa College Associated Students representative Kilma Lattin also spoke about the uncertainty and concerns of Mesa students.\n\n\u201cThere is confusion,\u201d Lattin said. \u201cIt seems like nobody really knows from a leadership standpoint, so we\u2019re looking forward to clear direction, however that comes about.\n\n\u201cMesa College has been great with information and has been forthcoming, so on behalf of students who I represent, I\u2019m excited to hear that (the board is) talking about it.\u201d\n\nCarroll acknowledged the challenges of making decisions in circumstances that she called unprecedented.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a pandemic like this in decades,\u201d she said. \u201cMany institutions have closed completely. Most are in the process of (deciding how) to keep the student body safe \u2026 by not forcing them into group interaction.\n\n\u201cHow do we keep continuity of our operations and instruction while we are surrounded by a barrage of data and directives? (It\u2019s a) very fast-moving situation. We want to be orderly in phasing in changes.\u201d\n\nCarroll said the first changes will come after assessing which classes can be converted to online, and how quickly it can be done.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working with professors to see what options there may be,\u201d Carroll said. \u201cWhat are the options for students who may not be able to take classes online? We\u2019re hoping over the next two weeks we can resolve these issues, and by no later than the end of spring break know what lies ahead.\u201d\n\nBoth the board and attendees who made public comments stressed the need for clear directives and frequent updates on whatever decisions that district and school officials feel is necessary.\n\nCarroll also noted that National University Chancellor Michael Cunningham offered up to three classes free of charge to students who need them during the crisis.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be necessary,\u201d SDCCD board member Maria Nieto Senour said. \u201cSo, I think one of the really important things is to keep communication flowing as much as we can because people will have unique situations or special conditions that we may not anticipate. We will do our best to stay on top of all that.\u201d","category":"state_of_emergency","population":261.0,"lat":43.3719,"lng":-96.9872}

USA TODAY\n\nThe Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota has declared a state of emergency and is asking for assistance in preparing for COVID-19.\n\nOglala President Julian Bear Runner is requesting the federal government provide medical supplies and tests for Indian Health Services on the Pine Ridge Reservation. He's also for protective measures be put in place for the Oglala nursing home and schools, according to the declaration he announced on Tuesday night.\n\nThe tests were supposed to be sent from the federal government to the county, but that hasn't happened, Bear Runner said. That lapse means that it's a threat to the Oglala tribal members without any way to test or treat it, he said, adding that that was \"alarming\" for him to hear.\n\n\"It was brought to my attention that the Indian Health Service here in Pine Ridge does not have the capabilities to properly test and diagnose for the COVID-19,\" he said. \"Who knows how long we will be walking with this disease and not be able to properly diagnose that, quarantine and treat those who have been affected.\"\n\nMap: Where in South Dakota has coronavirus been detected?\n\nAll IHS facilities are capable of testing patients for COVID-19 at no cost to the patient, according to an IHS statement. Clinicians at IHS collect samples and are using public health labs in their jurisdictions to test the samples. Testing is based on the local epidemiology of COVID-19, a patient's risk or exposure and the course of the illness, according to IHS.\n\nThe presumptive positive COVID-19 case in Charles Mix County is an IHS patient and the sample is currently being tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation, according to IHS. The federal agency is working with the state to identify anyone who has been in contact with the patient and may need to be tested, according to IHS.\n\nCoronavirus: South Dakota lawmakers say state has enough in budget for coronavirus response\n\n\"The IHS will continue to keep our tribal partners informed as the situation develops,\" IHS said in its statement.\n\nSouth Dakota officials announced there were five presumptive cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the state on Tuesday. In one of the cases, a man in his 60s died in Pennington County, but he had underlying health conditions and it was unclear on Tuesday whether the virus directly caused his death.\n\nBear Runner said he wants tribal members to use common sense to prevent the spread of the virus. He said he wants people to know that tribal leaders are doing everything they can to keep COVID-19 from spreading on the reservation.\n\nStory continues below:\n\n\"I don't want the people to panic. I don't want them to overreact, but I do want to assure the people that we, as elected officials of the Oglala Sioux Tribe, our departments, our employees, that we are staying on top of this, side by side with the emergency management team, to protect the health and welfare of the Oglala people,\" he said.\n\nThe Oglala Executive Board met on Tuesday after the state announced the cases and believed declaring a state of emergency was necessary, Bear Runner said. The Oglala, as well as a few other tribes in South Dakota, banned travel for tribal employees earlier this month because of the virus. The tribe has also created a response team for COVID-19 and is meeting with IHS staff.\n\nOglala tribal officials are also working to change the administrative leave policy to be more flexible to address individual situations, he said.\n\nThis content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

Many certainly spread the virus before showing symptoms & after suggested quarantine.\n\nConservative estimates suggest actual cases in each state are about 10 times the number of diagnosed, but researchers in Boston project it is upwards of 50 times the number of diagnosed.\n\nWe can see from China, Italy, Seattle, San Francisco, and New York where this is going.\n\nOur health care system will be overrun in a matter of weeks, if not before.\n\nDecisive action today will save lives.\n\nThere is also a strong economic case to make to take aggressive actions now. The longer we fail to act, the longer this continues. That will lead to more job loss, more closed businesses, more bankruptcies. It will not take a long-term view to see that waiting to act did not help local economies and small businesses.\n\nThese are our families, our friends, our communities at stake. I know this is weighing heavily.\n\nYou can save lives and mitigate the economic impact by aggressive, decisive action.\n\nPLEASE DECLARE A STATE EMERGENCY.\n\nShut down non-essential services through executive action.

As of the last public report from Fort Bliss, there were seven infections involving soldiers and civilian defense department employees at the facility.\n\nThe death and surging cases are the latest signs that the virus has become a national security challenge.\n\n\u201cWe will not report the aggregate number of individual service member cases at individual unit, base or Combatant Commands. We will continue to do our best to balance transparency in this crisis with operational security,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said in a statement on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon identified the first service member who died from the virus as Army Capt. Douglas Linn Hickok, a guardsman from New Jersey who had been hospitalized since March 21.\n\n\"Today is a sad day for the Department of Defense as we have lost our first American service member -- active, reserve or Guard -- to Coronavirus,\" U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said.\n\n\"This is a stinging loss for our military community, and our condolences go out to his family, friends, civilian co-workers and the entire National Guard community. The news of this loss strengthens our resolve to work ever more closely with our interagency partners to stop the spread of COVID-19,\" Esper added.\n\nBeyond the virus' spread within the armed forces, top U.S. commanders around the globe had previously expressed concerns that as allies shut down borders and travel, there's a risk that military readiness may start degrading, several defense officials told CNN.\n\nStill, the Department of Defense stressed in a news release Monday that it has \"adopted dramatic mitigation measures to protect service members, civilian employees, contractors and their families from Coronavirus.\"\n\n\"These include mandating social distancing, termination of certain work and training activities and providing testing and care for our community members,\" the release said.\n\nConcerns about the pandemic's spread drove the U.S. Marine Corps to temporarily suspend basic training for 50% of its new enlisted recruits on Monday, and the Pentagon is increasingly preparing for the possibility of wider outbreaks across the force than originally anticipated.\n\nEarlier this month, the U.S. Army began suspending \"non-mission essential functions,\" including some non-critical training of units in the field and physical fitness training involving large numbers of troops, according to an internal Army directive that was obtained by CNN.\n\n\"Mitigation measures taken by the Army to blunt the spread of COVID-19 have proven insufficient,\" the internal order said.","category":"None","population":10188.0,"lat":31.8137,"lng":-106.4119}

These numbers are going to go up, possibly dramatically.\u201d\n\nThe second person to test positive with coronavirus was a middle-aged man who traveled outside the country. He\u2019s recovering in isolation at home, Vohra said. Health officials are investigating the case trace the patient\u2019s contacts and contain any fallout, Vohra said. The patient was tested several days ago, and the county received the positive test results Saturday morning.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nVohra also provided an update on the county\u2019s first coronavirus patient: that person is recovering and none of their family members show signs of symptoms. While Vohra couldn\u2019t confirm the patient tested negatively, he could confirm the patient hasn\u2019t tested positive again.\n\nFewer than 60 Fresno County residents have submitted swabs for testing, and 50-75 people are being monitored after they returned from travel. While Fresno County doesn\u2019t have a lab that can test the swabs, the county has multiple labs available to send samples to, said David Pomaville, director of Fresno County Public Health Department.\n\nOne person with coronavirus on average could infect two or three others.\n\nDeclaring a state of emergency will give the county flexibility in managing its approximately 7,000 employees, many of whom have families affected by the school closures, Pomaville said. Later on, the declaration could also help the county apply for any funding relief. So far, costs incurred because of the coronavirus pandemic mostly amount to overtime pay, Pomaville said.\n\nVohra spent the weekend helping test people for COVID-19 out of an emergency clinic that was set up outside a medical facility. Test results for those patients will return in several cases.\n\n\u2018Social distancing\u2019\n\nWhile the risk of contracting the virus remains low for many Fresno County residents, health officials recommended people prepare for \u201csocial distancing.\u201d That means avoiding social gatherings of 250 people or more for people with low risk. More vulnerable populations, such as the elderly or those with compromised immune systems, it\u2019s best to avoid gatherings bigger than 10 people.\n\nIt\u2019s important to face the pandemic, and the public health department is ready to deal with and manage it, Vohra said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident we will rise to this occasion,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Mayor Lee Brand attended the news conference where county officials gave updates, he did not make any announcements for the city of Fresno. Those will come Monday, he said.\n\nHealth officials also addressed the public anxiety and stress about the epidemic.\n\nDawan Utech, director of Fresno County Behavioral Health, said it\u2019s important to establish trusted resources, such as information from the county\u2019s health departments.

(Courtesy Fulshear City Council livestream)\n\nhis declaration will be in place for no more than seven days unless extended by city council.\n\nAt the March 24 regular meeting, Fulshear City Council voted to extend the county\u2019s declaration of local disaster for public health emergency through April 23. The Council will meet again on April 21, and can decide to make changes based on developments of the coronavirus.Fulshear Mayor Aaron Groff signed a local disaster for public health emergency related to the coronavirus at 8 a.m. March 19, according to a press release. City services are operational, per the release, but the public will not be allowed in the following facilities: Fulshear City Hall, Fulshear Police Department, Fulshear Utility Billing Services, Fulshear Development Services and the Irene Stern Community Center.This declaration follows a March 18 event in which the Development Services Department located at 29255 FM 1093, Ste. 12-C, Fulshear, was temporarily closed due to possible employee exposure of the coronavirus, per a March 18 press release \u201cHowever, after a thorough investigation, along with discussions with the employee and all involved, it was determined that the employee did not come in contact with, nor was exposed to a person who had tested positive for COVID-19,\u201d the release stated.The city planned to reopen the department March 19, according to the March 18 release.Community Impact Newspaper reached out to learn the number of positive coronavirus cases confirmed in the city of Fulshear, but the city\u2019s public information officer did not immediately respond.As of 8:45 a.m., the city of Katy reported that the Houston region has 63 positive COVID-19 cases with 29 in Harris County, 12 in Fort Bend, zero in Waller County and Zero in the city of Katy. The state of Texas has 174 cases.At the March 17 regular Fulshear City Council meeting, Fulshear City Manager Jack Harper announced several new policies for city staff and advice for residents to follow as the unprecedented coronavirus continues to evolve.\"This has been an evolving, fluid situation that changes literally, as each of us knows, not only week by week but day by day and even hour by hour,\" Harper said.The first policy implemented is a pandemic leave policy, which states that if a city employee contracts the virus and becomes ill, the city will allow the employee to first use their sick leave, then vacation time and, if needed, the city would consider approving 80 hours for sick leave, Harper said.The hours would have to be paid back to the city, though not necessarily in cash as long as the employee is still working. If an employee is terminated, they will owe the city money.The next implementation is a self-quarantine policy, he said. If city employees or anyone from their immediate household traveled internationally, they must self-quarantine for at least 14 days.The city is also implementing a telework policy, for which the city weighed essential versus nonessential employees to decide which city employees would be able to work from home, Harper said.\"While we have been monitoring this since December ... as far as the city response, Fort Bend County has declared a state of emergency, and ... it is our responsibility to adhere to that,\" Harper said.As of March 17, there were 10 COVID-19 cases in Fort Bend County and 64 cases and one death in Texas, said Fulshear Police Department Sgt. Felix Vargas, who has been monitoring the evolving coronavirus closely.\"A special shoutout goes to the men and women of the Fulshear Police Department because they are truly on the front lines, and they will have more personal interaction with other people than any other department, so I am really proud of them,\" Harper said.Harper recommended that citizens pay their bills online or in the mail rather than in person.\"Right know, there [are] a lot of concerns throughout the United States about what's safe and what's not safe, but at the end of the day, I'm really proud of the men and women who work for the city of Fulshear because they are dedicated to serving each and every one of you all in the city,\" Harper said. \"They are still here doing their job, and no matter what happens, the city will ensure that all operations continue and that no one should be able to notice the difference.\"","category":"state_of_emergency","population":10044.0,"lat":29.693,"lng":-95.8792}

Additionally, more than 3,500 people have died and nearly 6,000 have recovered.\n\nWorldwide, more than 809,000 people are confirmed to have contracted COVID-19, with 39,000 deaths and 172,000 people recovered.\n\nWhite House Coronavirus Task Force holds press briefing\n\nPresident Donald Trump warned the U.S. public during the press conference saying, the country is about to enter a \u201crough two week period.\u201d\n\nDr. Fauci gave some optimistic words in his statements, yet urged the American public to stay vigilant for the next month. Fauci said they have been making efforts \"to get the hot spot places, the New York's, the New Jersey's.\" Going on to say it's in an effort \"to prevent them from getting to that spike, and the answer to that is mitigation.\" Dr. Fauci told reporters that these efforts have been working. He says that the additional 30 days of stay at home orders is a necessity.\n\nDr. Birx came to the podium and said, regarding the previous estimate of possible deaths given by the White House at 100,000 200,000: \u201cthat is a projection.\u201d Birx confirmed that the peak of that will come over the next two weeks, so the first weeks of April.\n\nDr. Fauci said that the death rate always lags, so we should be prepared that even though we continue to see deaths, we can still be doing \"really, really well\" in terms of mitigation.\n\nReporters gathered in the Brady Briefing Room Tuesday at the White House as the group of administration officials given the mission of leading the coronavirus battle in the US was set to update the public.\n\nReporters at the briefing received flyers promoting a 30 day period to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nPresident Trump greeted reporters starting out by staying, \"15 days ago we published our nationwide guidelines to slow the spread.\" The White House is asking the public to follow these guidelines for the next 30-days with the president saying this is a matter of \"life and death.\"\n\nU.S. officials are mulling if advice given by the World Health Organization on wearing masks might change. Currently if you are not sick, officials ask that you do not wear a mask, but if the mask shortage that's endangering health workers ends White House officials could broaden their request for who should wear them.\n\nWorldwide, the top priority for masks goes to health workers, who are in close contact with patients. The WHO also recommends the sick wear them. It has insisted there is no proven benefit for the general population even if there weren't a shortage.\n\nU.S. officials say any change in advice would have to come once health workers have enough masks.\n\nDr. Fauci says White House may recommend broader use of masks\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci said the White House coronavirus task force is looking into the idea of recommending broader, community-wide use of masks to deter the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nFauci said the task force first wants to make sure that such a move wouldn\u2019t take away from the supply of masks available to health care workers.\n\n\u201cBut once we get in a situation where we have enough masks, I believe there will be some very serious consideration about more broadening this recommendation of using masks,\u201d Fauci said in a CNN interview Tuesday. \u201cWe're not there yet, but I think we're close to coming to some determination.\u201d\n\nHe said wearing a mask may prevent an infected person from spreading the virus.\n\nFauci is the director National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leader of the U.S. response to the pandemic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday he could see broader use of masks on a temporary basis.\n\n\u201cI mean, you know, we want our country back. We're not going to be wearing masks forever, but it could be for a short period of time,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe World Health Organization on Monday reiterated its advice that the general population doesn't need to wear masks unless they're sick. Since the epidemic began in China, the WHO has said masks are for the sick and people caring for them.\n\nU.N Secretary General says pandemic could be most challenging crisis since WWII\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is warning that the world faces the most challenging crisis since World War II, confronting a pandemic threatening people in every country that will bring a recession \u201cthat probably has no parallel in the recent past.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. chief said at the launch of a report Tuesday on the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 there is also a risk that the combination of the disease and its economic impact will contribute to \u201cenhanced instability, enhanced unrest, and enhanced conflict.\u201d\n\nGuterres called for a stronger and more effective global response to the coronavirus pandemic and to the social and economic devastation that COVID-19 is causing.\n\nHe stressed that this will only be possible \u201cif everybody comes together and if we forget political games and understand that it is humankind that is at stake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe magnitude of the response must match the scale of the crisis \u2014 large-scale, coordinated and comprehensive, with country and international responses being guided by the World Health Organization,\u201d the secretary-general said, noting that not all countries are following WHO guidelines.\n\nGuterres announced the establishment of a COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund to support efforts in low- and middle-income countries, with the aim of swiftly enabling governments to tackle the crisis and promote recovery.\n\nUS death toll surpasses China's official count\n\nThe U.S. death toll from the coronavirus has climbed past 3,500, eclipsing China's official count.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported Tuesday that deaths in New York state had risen more than 300 from the day before, reaching about 1,550, mostly in New York City.\n\nThat puts the U.S. ahead of China's official death toll of about 3,300.\n\nCNN anchor Chris Cuomo tests positive\n\nCNN anchor Chris Cuomo announced Tuesday morning that he has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nCuomo, the brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, explained on Twitter that he had been exposed to people in recent days who then tested positive and he had \"fever, chills and shortness of breath.\"\n\nHe said he is quarantined in his basement and plans to continue to do his CNN shows from there. Cuomo added that he hopes he didn't give it to his kids or his wife, because that would make him feel worse than the illness.\n\nU.S. State Department official has died from virus\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo says a State Department official has died from the coronavirus, the first American fatality among the U.S. diplomatic corps from the pandemic.\n\nPompeo didn't give details about the official who passed away or where the person contracted the disease. He says about four to five dozen State Department employees had tested positive for the virus, including locally employed staffers at a handful of the 220 U.S. embassies and consulates abroad.\n\nNY convention center starts taking patients\n\nNew York's mammoth convention center started taking patients to ease the burden on the city's overwhelmed health system and the tennis center where the U.S. Open is held was being turned into a hospital Tuesday.\n\nNew York has been the nation's deadliest hot spot, with over 1,200 deaths statewide, the majority of them in New York City \u2014 a toll Gov. Andrew Cuomo called \u201cbeyond staggering.\u201d\n\nSouthwest cuts flight schedule by 40%\n\nSouthwest Airlines said Tuesday it is temporarily reducing its flight schedule by more than 40%. The company said the cuts are now in place for May 3-June 5 and brings the airline to approximately 2,000 flights a day.\n\n\"The cuts proactively address significantly lower passenger demand, operational disruptions, and the ongoing suspension of our international service,\" Southwest said in its announcement.\n\n7-Eleven donates masks\n\n7-Eleven said Tuesday it has donated one million masks to FEMA in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a release, the company said it supplied all of its stores and franchisees with masks for employees to use and the rest have been donated.\n\nU.S. virus death toll surpasses death toll from 9\/11 attacks\n\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the U.S. from the new virus, according to the John Hopkins tracker. This number surpasses the number of people who died in the initial attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.\n\nThe John Hopkins tracker also indicates that almost 6,000 people have recovered from the virus, which causes the disease known as COVID-19.\n\nTo put the virus death numbers into context, according to the CDC, it's predicted that 24,000-62,000 people have died from the flu between October 2019 and March 2020.\n\nWalmart announces additional steps for worker safety\n\nWalmart has announced it will be taking additional health and safety measures to keep its workers safe amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn a letter on the Walmart website, the company said it would begin taking the temperatures of associates as they come to work. Employees running a temperatures of 100 degrees or higher will be paid for reporting to work and asked to go home. The company has also ordered masks and gloves for employees to use.\n\n\"As our company and country continue to deal with the spread of COVID-19, we remain focused on the health and safety of our associates.\" John Furner, President & CEO said in a statement.\n\nNYC reports 1st coronavirus death of a person under 18\n\nNew York City has recorded its first coronavirus death of a person under 18 years old, according to the city Health Department.\n\nThe city's 914 deaths from the pandemic include one person in the 0-17 age group, the department reported Monday. Details including the person's exact age were not disclosed.\n\nMore than 1,200 have died of COVID-19 across New York state, and 9,500 people are hospitalized with the disease statewide. More than 2,300 are in intensive care, and more than 66,000 have tested positive for the virus.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that he expects the crisis to stretch at least into May. \u201cFor the weeks ahead, let\u2019s not kid ourselves, it gets a lot worse before it gets better,\u201d he said on NBC's \u201cToday.\u201d\n\nWorld virus infections top 800,000; Spain sees record deaths\n\nSpain's coronavirus deaths have jumped by a record number as the country's medical system strains to care for its tens of thousands of infected patients and the world total climbed to more than 800,000 cases. In the United States, New York's governor begged for health care reinforcements, saying up to 1 million more workers were needed. Spain and Italy are still struggling to avoid the collapse of their health systems, with Spain saying hospitals in at least half of its 17 regions are at or very near their ICU bed limits. Spain also has more than 13,000 infected medical workers.\n\nChina warns epidemic isn't over for their country\n\nChinese officials say the coronavirus epidemic isn\u2019t over in their country and that daunting challenges remain.\n\nForeign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Tuesday that authorities need to make sure that infected people arriving from abroad don\u2019t spread the disease and start new outbreaks.\n\nShe hit back at U.S. criticism of her country\u2019s handling of the epidemic, saying that China and the U.S. should work together to fight it.\n\nSpain records 849 new deaths in one day\n\nSpain recorded on Tuesday 849 new coronavirus deaths, the highest number since the pandemic hit the southern European country, according to the country\u2019s health ministry.\n\nWith both new infections and deaths up around 11% each, to a total of 94,417 confirmed cases and 8,189 fatalities, Spain is seeing a slight rebound in the outbreak.\n\nThat's despite an overall timid slowdown in its spread for the past week, allowing authorities to focus on avoiding the collapse of the health system. At least one third of Spain's 17 regions were already at their limit of capacity in terms of intensive care unit usage, while new beds are being added in hotels, exhibition and sports centers across the country.\n\nBritish death toll higher than previously thought\n\nMore people with the new coronavirus have died in Britain than previously announced, according to newly published figures that include deaths both in and out of hospitals.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics says that 210 deaths recorded England and Wales up to March 20 mentioned COVID-19 on the death certificate. That is 40 more than the 170 deaths among people with the virus reported by the Department of Health for the same period.\n\nThe two sets of figures use different reporting methods and timing. The Department of Health statistics record hospital deaths. Tuesday\u2019s higher figure includes people who died in nursing homes and other settings. Some of those are people who were not tested for the virus but were suspected of having it.\n\nRussia cases spike\n\nRussia registered 500 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus on Tuesday in the biggest spike since the beginning of the outbreak that brought the country's total to 2,337 cases.\n\nThe report comes as Russia edges closer to declaring a state of emergency, with many regions and cities ordering lockdowns and sweeping self-isolation protocols.\n\nMoscow, the country's capital, has been on lockdown since Monday, with most businesses closed and residents not allowed to leave their apartments except for grocery shopping, buying medicines, taking out trash or walking their dogs. Similar regimes are in place in more than 30 Russian regions.\n\nDenmark considering gradual lift of restrictions\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Denmark could start lifting some restrictions next month if the coronavirus curve continues to flatten out.\n\nFrederiksen said late Monday that if Danes continue to stand together \u2014 at a distance \u2014 the government will consider gradually opening up in two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nShe underlined that the crisis was far from over but there was growing evidence that Denmark, which started a gradual lockdown on March 11, had \u201csucceeded in delaying the infection,\u201d adding it gave \u201ca rise to optimism.\u201d\n\nAlso in the Nordic region, Finland has decided to extend by a month the duration of the emergency conditions in the southern part of the country affecting the daily lives of some 1.7 million people, nearly a third of Finland's population.\n\nBritish Airways suspends all flights at Gatwick Airport\n\nBritish Airways has suspended all its flights at Gatwick Airport amid a collapse in demand.\n\nThe carrier says that \u201crestrictions and challenging market environment,\u201d led to the decision.\n\nThe aviation industry has been hard-hit by the pandemic that has prompted travelers around the world to stay home.\n\nAirports themselves are also slowing down. Just 33 flights were due to take off or land at Gatwick on Tuesday, according to aviation data provider FlightStats.

We need every country to keep responding according to their local situation.\u201d\n\nHe said the WHO realizes there is no one-size-fits-all approach but there are common tactics. \u201cThose are: finding, isolating and testing case early, tracing and quarantining contact quickly, and putting in place multiple public health interventions to place physical distance between people to slow and stop transmission.\u201d\n\nJapan extends travel warnings to 49 countries\n\nJapan has extended its highest travel warnings to 49 countries, including the United States, Canada and Britain, as well as all of China and South Korea.\n\nThe country is urging Japanese citizens not to visit places where coronavirus infections are escalating, the foreign ministry said in a statement Tuesday.

{"city":"Liberty","state":"TX","publish_date":"04-01-2020 00:00","url":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2020\/4\/1\/21201104\/texas-pastors-religious-liberty-coronavirus-stay-at-home-hotze","title":"Texas pastors demand a \u201creligious liberty\u201d exemption to coronavirus stay-at-home orders","text":"Last week, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, who oversees the area of Texas that includes Houston, issued an order requiring \u201call individuals currently living within Harris County ... to stay at their place of residence except for Essential Activities\u201d (in Texas, the title \u201ccounty judge\u201d refers to the chief executive of a county government).\n\nLike many similar orders handed down by state and local officials throughout the United States, which are intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, Hidalgo\u2019s order closes most businesses within the county and shuts down most places where people gather in large groups. Although it allows faith leaders to \u201cminister and counsel in individual settings, so long as social distance protocols are followed,\u201d it requires worship services to \u201cbe provided by video and teleconference.\u201d\n\nThat restriction on in-person worship services has sparked a lawsuit, filed by three Texas pastors and Steven Hotze, a medical doctor and anti-LGBT Republican activist whose political action committee was labeled a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. These four men ask the Texas Supreme Court to strike down Hidalgo\u2019s order, claiming, among other things, that it violates the \u201creligious liberty\u201d of pastors who wish to gather their parishioners together during a pandemic.\n\nThe case is named In re Hotze.\n\nUnder existing precedents, the petitioner\u2019s arguments in Hotze are not strong. They rely heavily on older US Supreme Court decisions that were effectively overruled by the Supreme Court\u2019s later decision in Employment Division v. Smith (1990) (although it\u2019s worth noting that Smith is very much out of favor with judicial conservatives and could, itself, be overruled by the Court\u2019s current majority).\n\nThe Hotze petitions also essentially ask the Texas Supreme Court to place the temporary interests of a few pastors before the county\u2019s interest in combating a deadly disease. The US Supreme Court has long held that the government may take targeted action to protect especially compelling interests \u2014 even when doing so implicates constitutional rights.\n\nYet, while there is little legal support for the Hotze petitioners\u2019 arguments, the Texas Supreme Court is notoriously conservative \u2014 all nine of its members are Republicans \u2014 so there is, at least, some chance that the Hotze petition succeeds.\n\nIt is at least as likely, however, that the Texas justices will recognize that they need to place some limits on the religious liberty doctrine. Unlike other high-profile lawsuits about religious exemptions to generally applicable laws, Hotze does not pit a Republican interest group (such as business owners with conservative religious views) against a group associated with Democrats (such as LGBTQ people).\n\nHotze places the public health of an entire community against the interests of a handful of pastors (and, potentially, parishioners) with an idiosyncratic view of the pandemic.\n\nThe government may limit religious liberty if it has a sufficiently compelling reason to do so\n\nThe Hotze petition mingles legal arguments with Trumpian rhetoric and familiar Republican Party talking points. One subsection of the petition argues, falsely, that the coronavirus is less dangerous than the flu. An entire section of the petition suggests that Judge Hidalgo\u2019s order is invalid because it \u201cpicks winners and losers.\u201d\n\nThe petition also makes some fairly basic legal errors. It argues, for example, that the First Amendment\u2019s clause protecting the \u201cfree exercise\u201d of religion requires courts to strike down Hidalgo\u2019s order unless that order is supported by a \u201ccompelling government interest.\u201d But the Supreme Court rejected this reading of the First Amendment in Smith.\n\nUnder Smith, \u201cthe right of free exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a valid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).\u201d That is, so long as Hidalgo\u2019s order does not single out places of worship for inferior treatment that it does not impose on similar organizations, the order does not violate the First Amendment.\n\nThat said, there is a case pending before the US Supreme Court right now that asks the justices to overrule Smith. And the argument against Smith is likely to receive a very sympathetic audience from the Court\u2019s Republican majority. The Texas Constitution also contains strong language protecting religious freedom, and the state\u2019s highest court is free to interpret that language differently from the US Supreme Court read of the First Amendment in Smith.\n\nSo it is not that much of a stretch to say that Texas pastors enjoy strong constitutional protections against a government order regulating how they conduct worship services.\n\nYet, even the Hotze petitioners admit that these protections are not unlimited. Rather, they concede that the government may take actions that limit religious freedom if such actions are \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to advance a \u201ccompelling interest.\u201d\n\nThis test, which is also known as \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d is the same test the US Supreme Court applies to laws that restrict speech or that discriminate on the basis of race. But, even in the context of censorship or race discrimination, strict scrutiny is not insurmountable. A study by UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, for example, found that federal courts applying the compelling interest test upheld 22 percent of free speech restrictions and 27 percent of laws that engaged in discrimination between 1990 and 2003.\n\nThe government interest at stake in Hotze, moreover, is protecting human life from a disease that threatens to kill millions. And Hidalgo\u2019s order is narrow in that it does not ban worship services. It simply requires them to be temporarily held online until the pandemic passes.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic could force the US Supreme Court to place some limits on \u201creligious liberty\u201d\n\nUntil fairly recently, the Supreme Court recognized that there must be some practical limits on a religious objector\u2019s ability to seek exemptions from generally applicable laws. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the Court in Smith, \u201cto make an individual\u2019s obligation to obey [the] law contingent upon the law\u2019s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State\u2019s interest is \u2018compelling\u2019\u201d is to permit that individual \u201cto become a law unto himself.\u201d\n\nAccordingly, the Court typically had been reluctant to grant religious liberty exemptions to a law when granting such an exception could harm third parties. And it was especially reluctant to give religious liberty exemptions to businesses. As the Court explained in United States v. Lee (1982), \u201cwhen followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice, the limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on the statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), the Supreme Court held, for the first time, that religious objectors may sometimes wield those objections to limit the rights of third parties \u2014 Hobby Lobby held that business owners who object to birth control may refuse to include contraceptive coverage in their employee\u2019s health plans.\n\nThus far, however, the Court\u2019s latest line of religious liberty cases has largely pitted conservative religious groups against laws favored by liberals, including laws protecting birth control access and laws prohibiting anti-LGBTQ discrimination. Hotze is different because the pandemic impacts Democrats and Republicans alike. Indeed, if the pastors behind Hotze get their way, the biggest losers are likely to be their parishioners, who will be at immediate risk of infection.\n\nHotze, in other words, potentially offers the courts an ideal vehicle to draw limits around the new \u201creligious liberty\u201d doctrines advanced by cases like Hobby Lobby. It\u2019s hard to imagine a more compelling interest than preventing a deadly disease from spreading unchecked through the population. And Hotze shows that everyone, liberal and conservative alike, benefits from a society with universal laws.","category":"shelter_in_place","population":6366.0,"lat":30.047,"lng":-94.7908}

Greg Abbott in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile some individual organizations, including school districts and churches, and businesses had already undertaken their own measures to reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus and contracting the COVID-19 disease, Thursday's declarations by the state, county and city mandates certain closures and restrictions on public activities including restaurants, bars, movie theaters, gyms, event centers and other businesses catering to the public. The restrictions also cover weddings, religious gatherings, parties, funerals, sporting events, social events and conferences as hospital and care center visitations.\n\nPublic and private gatherings and functions are limited to no more than 10 people present, with exceptions made for large building and offices as long as social distancing recommendations are followed and they are not in the same room or space.\n\nThe local declarations are in place for seven days, through midnight Friday, March 27, unless Mineral Wells City Council and Palo Pinto County Commissioners extend the disaster period for their respective entities \u2013 which is likely.\n\n\"We want to be sure that everybody understands that the actions we are taking are for the health and safety of our community,\" said Palo Pinto County Judge Shane Long. \"I realize there are some inconveniences that come with that.\"\n\nLong and Mineral Wells Mayor Tammy Underwood read their respective declarations in council chambers at the Mineral Wells City Hall Annex \u2013 attended only by them, City Manager Randy Criswell, Mineral Wells Emergency Management Coordinator and Fire Chief Mike Pool and a member of the media.

In some cases officials are involved in statewide calls, such as one Underwood participated in Thursday with the governor's office.\n\nMineral Wells officials held back issuing a disaster declaration earlier in the week because there were not yet any confirmed or presumptive cases of the virus in the county or an adjacent county. However, once Gov.

Everyone has to do their own part. So please don't be defiant about what these rules are. The quicker that we all abide by this and stop the spread, the quicker we can get back to life as we know it and love it. So I just ask that every individual do your part and take care of yourself, your family and your neighbor.\"\n\nCity officials on Tuesday closed non-essential facilities and suspended some services.\n\nThe city's disaster declaration includes several steps and protocols such as authorization to \"temporarily or permanently acquire by lease, purchase, or other means sites required for installation of temporary housing units or emergency shelters for disaster victims; and (2) enter into arrangements necessary to prepare or equip the sites to use the housing units or shelters, including arrangements for the purchase of temporary housing units or shelters and the payment of transportation charges.\"\n\nIt also provides for the establishment of quarantine rules if necessary.

Laura Kelly to shut down abortions in Wichita during the threat from coronavirus COVID-19.\n\nThe recommendation would redefine nearly all abortions as nonessential medical services that could not be provided during the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order issued by Kelly to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe measure, aimed at the Trust Women Wichita Clinic, is largely symbolic because the commission doesn\u2019t have the authority to alter the governor\u2019s order and she\u2019s indicated publicly she supports keeping women\u2019s health clinics open.\n\nThe 4-1 commission vote came Wednesday after a tense debate between Michael O\u2019Donnell, who proposed the measure, and Jim Howell who supported it, versus the commission\u2019s only female member, Lacey Cruse.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m raped in the middle of the night and this (coronavirus emergency) goes on another eight weeks, are you going to make me have my rapist\u2019s baby?\u201d Cruse asked. \u201cAre you going to make a woman who is going to die because of the baby, are you going to make her die? Those are the types of things that you\u2019re asking.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell said he based his motion to shut down abortions on photographs of out-of-state license plates taken by anti-abortion protesters outside the Trust Women clinic.\n\nHe said the photos and protesters\u2019 observations show that the clinic is bringing in patients and providers from other states where the coronavirus is more prevalent, although he conceded that an initial report of a California doctor at the clinic was false.\n\n\u201cMy heart does break for women that are put in those (rape) situations,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said. \u201cI have family members that have been sexually assaulted myself that have been put in situations that no one would want to dream about, (but) we are in an unprecedented time with COVID-19 and limiting exposure.\n\nBy allowing abortions, \u201cWe are putting people that are vulnerable, putting them in a much more vulnerable situation by not knowing if these people are practicing at the clinic have the virus, have come in contact with other people with the virus,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said women needing life-saving abortions should be treated at a hospital rather than the clinic.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t political, this is concern about human life, protecting life whether it\u2019s the unborn or individuals that may or may not come in contact with COVID-19,\u201d he said.\n\nCruse said O\u2019Donnell was only pushing for the ban for political gain and that there is no hospital in the county that will perform abortions.\n\n\u201cI feel like you\u2019re just speaking out of your \u2026\u201d she said, before stopping herself and continuing: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like you are really speaking factually about this.\u201d\n\nHowell read from a long list of accusations against the clinic made by unnamed abortion opponents, including one allegation that a security guard there had handed a sidewalk protester a trash bag full of vomit and used tissues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve not substantiated the stories,\u201d Howell said. \u201cBut that\u2019s what\u2019s been reported and I\u2019ve talked to people who said they witnessed it and this is what happened. So if this is the type of behavior that is going on, I have very grave concerns about the spread of COVID-19.\u201d\n\nJulie Burkhart, the CEO of the clinic, has said the facility is following the same coronavirus prevention procedures used by hospitals and actually had the protocols in place before a lot of other health care facilities.\n\nBurkhart was not allowed to attend the meeting. Only the commissioners and limited staff could be in the room because of the governor\u2019s order limiting public gatherings to 10 people or fewer.\n\nHowever, Cruse read Burkhart\u2019s written testimony into the record of the meeting.\n\nIn it, Burkhart said the county\u2019s action, if it ever takes effect, would actually spur more travel than it would prevent, because women from Kansas would need to go to Colorado or New Mexico for abortion services.\n\nTexas and Oklahoma have already banned abortions during the COVID-19 threat.\n\nO\u2019Donnell originally proposed recommending a full shutdown of the Trust Women clinic for the duration of the emergency.\n\nBut Commissioner David Dennis offered an alternate motion, that was adopted, to allow non-abortion care such as cervical cancer screening and birth control services to be done by the clinic.\n\nThe current rules were established by Kelly, cover the whole state and preempt county stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe governor said in a news conference Wednesday that women\u2019s clinics should and will be allowed to stay open under her emergency order.\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s reproductive health is considered an essential need and all healthcare clinics will fall under that category,\u201d she said.\n\nSenate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, also weighed in, issuing a statement taking the side of the commission majority.\n\n\u201cWhile high risk screenings and all elective procedures throughout the state are being canceled and doctor\u2019s offices are struggling to survive, why should an elective abortion be an exception?\u201d she said. \u201cPersonal protective equipment is in short supply during this pandemic. Making an exception for an elective abortion is inexcusable.\u201d\n\nEven if that state rule were not in place, county Health Officer Garold Minns is the only one with the direct authority to order stay-home rules in the county, although the commission can make recommendations to him.\n\nContributing: Jonathan Shorman of The Eagle","category":"None","population":null,"lat":null,"lng":null}

The restrictions also cover weddings, religious gatherings, parties, funerals, sporting events, social events and conferences as hospital and care center visitations.\n\nPublic and private gatherings and functions are limited to no more than 10 people present, with exceptions made for large building and offices as long as social distancing recommendations are followed and they are not in the same room or space.\n\nThe local declarations are in place for seven days, through midnight Friday, March 27, unless Mineral Wells City Council and Palo Pinto County Commissioners extend the disaster period for their respective entities \u2013 which is likely.\n\n\"We want to be sure that everybody understands that the actions we are taking are for the health and safety of our community,\" said Palo Pinto County Judge Shane Long. \"I realize there are some inconveniences that come with that.\"\n\nLong and Mineral Wells Mayor Tammy Underwood read their respective declarations in council chambers at the Mineral Wells City Hall Annex \u2013 attended only by them, City Manager Randy Criswell, Mineral Wells Emergency Management Coordinator and Fire Chief Mike Pool and a member of the media.

Everyone has to do their own part. So please don't be defiant about what these rules are. The quicker that we all abide by this and stop the spread, the quicker we can get back to life as we know it and love it. So I just ask that every individual do your part and take care of yourself, your family and your neighbor.\"\n\nCity officials on Tuesday closed non-essential facilities and suspended some services.\n\nThe city's disaster declaration includes several steps and protocols such as authorization to \"temporarily or permanently acquire by lease, purchase, or other means sites required for installation of temporary housing units or emergency shelters for disaster victims; and (2) enter into arrangements necessary to prepare or equip the sites to use the housing units or shelters, including arrangements for the purchase of temporary housing units or shelters and the payment of transportation charges.\"\n\nIt also provides for the establishment of quarantine rules if necessary.

Trump and Texas Governor Greg Abbott made similar declarations earlier today.\n\nAccording to the new release, the declaration was made pursuant to the Texas Disaster Act of 1975 and the Texas Government Code Section 418.108(a), which designates the mayor as Emergency Management Director for the city and allows him to authorize the use of all available resources to assist in the city\u2019s response to the public health emergency.\n\n\u201cCity officials have determined that extraordinary and immediate measures must be taken to respond quickly, prevent and alleviate the suffering of people exposed to and those infected with the virus, as well as those that could potentially be impacted by COVID-19,\u201d the release reads. \u201cCity officials have been taking measures to mitigate the virus, including increasing community awareness providing information and methods for personal health and safety via social media and the City\u2019s website. City leaders ensure the public that the City\u2019s Continuity of Operations (COOP) and Continuity of Government (COG) plans are actively reviewed and updated to ensure that critical government services remain uninterrupted during this crisis.\u201d\n\nPharr is also taking measures to assist residents by announcing it would not be shutting off water for non-payment during the duration of this crisis.\n\nCity officials are encouraging all residents to follow health and safety precautionary measures, and heed the advice of authorities to stay safe during this disaster.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":79487.0,"lat":26.1685,"lng":-98.1904}

The declaration, enacted on March 18 by Rollingwood Mayor Michael Dyson to deter the spread of COVID-19, was set to expire Wednesday.\n\nThe action follows the more restrictive shelter in place orders enacted by the city of Austin and Travis County on Tuesday. The city falls under the county\u2019s restrictions now in effect.\n\nThe city can implement more stringent regulations than Travis County but, at a bare minimum, must enforce the county\u2019s declaration, Dyson said.\n\nAlthough the order lists qualifying essential services that are exempt from its restrictions, council members said residents and contractors have asked whether that exemption includes residential and commercial construction that doesn\u2019t affect critical infrastructure within the city, such as drainage pipelines.\n\nAccording to Dyson, the city currently has 80 active construction permits. City officials, including City Attorney Charles Zech, have requested clarification from Travis County as to whether all construction is considered \"essential\" or whether such activity must be stopped as of the county\u2019s shelter in place order.\n\n\"That\u2019s why we\u2019re seeking clarification on what essential is,\" Dyson said. \"It is possible that the county\u2019s intent was for all commercial and residential to button up immediately at 11:59 (p.m. on Tuesday)?\"\n\nLocal law enforcement officers have discretion as to how they handle these types of issues, Zech said, noting that a health and safety issue may exist when a construction job site suddenly shuts down.\n\nRollingwood Police Chief Jason Brady said his department has already received some complaints from neighbors referencing construction issues. He said his officers followed up on these reports on Wednesday and found four separate construction crews working on three residential job sites in close proximity to each other on Timberline Drive.\n\n\"If you\u2019re looking at the intention of the order from the county judge, you\u2019ve got lots of crews that were completely different crews all walking amongst each other,\" Brady said. \"So those are things to consider. \u2026 The goal (of the order) was to keep people from gathering in large numbers to stop the spread of the virus.\"\n\nHe said three of the sites voluntarily shut down since they were at a point at which they could end their activity. However, he said his staff left one crew onsite for two additional hours in order to secure exposed rebar that posed a safety hazard.\n\n\"We thought, at that point, there was more danger to leave that exposed than not,\" Brady said. \"This is an emergency situation, and there\u2019s going to have to be a lot of discretion, case by case, as to what\u2019s appropriate.\"\n\nThe city intends to send a formal notice to local contractors informing them that they will likely have to suspend their projects at least for a couple of weeks, by Friday, Dyson said. The measure is intended \"to safeguard against any kind of potential damage to the property or health and safety items.\" Contractors can contact the city on a case-by-case basis if they have extenuating circumstances, he said.\n\n\"One of the things that I want us to bear in mind is we have to send city staff and inspectors, city personnel, to monitor these situations,\" Dyson said.\n\nCouncil Member Amy Pattillo said she hopes the community and contractors can come together with a public safety focus to ensure the city doesn\u2019t have projects that may get damaged with a delay in completing them, such as construction shell sites that don\u2019t have a roof or sites that lack a security alarm.\n\nCouncil Member Buck Shapiro said he favored limiting site excavation on a case-by-case basis, allowing one trade on each building site with two or three of their workers as opposed to shutting down all construction in the city.\n\n\"I think the economic ripple effect of this is going to be something unprecedented in our time,\" he said. \"I think (my idea) allows people who live paycheck to paycheck to keep working and make money and pay their bills. And, I think the risk, at that point, is very minimal if you limit the number of trades to one and you limit that trade to how many folks they can have out there.\"\n\nHowever, in doing so, Dyson said the city would be asking its officials and contractors to go out and inspect these sites as well as its police officers to ensure that only a single trade is in place, actions that may go outside of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\"We are staring down the barrel of a health crisis here and everybody needs to pull together to do the absolute best we can do,\" Dyson said.\n\nAt the meeting, Dyson announced:\n\n\u2014 Two residents began a program pairing local volunteers with Rollingwood\u2019s most vulnerable residents to perform needed errands for them, such as grocery shopping, following COVID-19 restrictions. The program is not sponsored by the city. For more information, residents should call Rollingwood City Hall at 512-327-1838; Rolling Police Department at 512-328-1900 or email Dyson at mdyson@rollingwoodtx.gov.\n\n\u2014 A municipal disasters services committee was established.\n\n\u2014 An operational disaster service organization was established.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":1560.0,"lat":30.2736,"lng":-97.7867}

Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.\n\nThe coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2.\n\nExperts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it.\n\nThe disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.\n\nDr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals.\n\n'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).\n\n'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.'\n\nThe first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31.\n\nBy January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.\n\nThe first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.\n\nWhere does the virus come from?\n\nAccording to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals \u2013 the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively.\n\nThe first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation.\n\nAlthough the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.\n\nA study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats.\n\nHowever, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.\n\nDr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China.\n\n'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.'\n\nSo far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?\n\nExperts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.\n\nIt is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19.\n\nAnother reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.\n\n'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.'\n\nIf the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.\n\n'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.\n\n'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'\n\nHow does the virus spread?\n\nThe illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms.\n\nIt is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nOriginally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.\n\nWhat does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?\n\nOnce someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms \u2013 but they may still be contagious during this time.\n\nIf and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.\n\nIn a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.\n\nFigures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why.\n\nWhat have genetic tests revealed about the virus?\n\nScientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.\n\nThis allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.\n\nExaminations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much \u2013 changing is known as mutating \u2013 much during the early stages of its spread.\n\nHowever, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people.\n\nThis means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.\n\nMore study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately.\n\nHow dangerous is the virus?\n\nThe virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people.\n\nExperts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is.\n\nHowever, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.\n\nDr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.\n\nCan the virus be cured?\n\nThe COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.\n\nAntibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money.\n\nNo vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nCurrently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.\n\nPeople who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.\n\nAnd airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).\n\nHowever, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.\n\nIs this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?\n\nThe outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'.\n\nPreviously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.","category":"deaths","population":491.0,"lat":33.6499,"lng":-98.4677}

According to City Manager Wyatt Shields, city staff have been going door to door with information to senior housing facilities as well as property managers at apartment buildings.\n\nShields also addressed how residents should approach testing for COVID-19. The first step is contacting a doctor when experiencing symptoms.\n\n\n\n\"The criteria for getting a test is strict, and that is driven by the lack of testing equipment,\" said Shields. \"That is being ramped up quickly, so I think that situation will change and there will be more testing at the physician level.\"\n\nThe Fairfax County Health Department, which covers the city, advised there are no immediate plans for mass testing like drive-through testing, Shields said. Virginia and Maryland's governors and the DC mayor pressed for federal support to host a drive-through testing site in each jurisdiction.\n\nSEE ALSO: Virginia Coronavirus Updates: What To Know For Week Of March 15\n\nCouncilmember Ross Litkenhous suggested reallocating staff affected by closures to take questions from residents on a central phone line.

She called for city outreach to urge property managers not evict tenants.\n\n\n\nShields said there is limited emergency rent relief, but there should be consideration to increase that relief in the city budget.\n\nThe city continues to provide updates on the new coronavirus impact online. Large-scale emergency messages will also be communicated through Falls Church Alerts.\n\n\n\nHere is the guidance for residents to mitigate the spread of illness:\n\nPractice social and physical distancing: keep a 6-foot distance from others; bring disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer when in public; and do not shake hands, hug, or otherwise make physical contact with others.\n\nStay home when sick.\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown.\n\nThe coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2.\n\nExperts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it.\n\nThe disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.\n\nDr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals.\n\n'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses).\n\n'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.'\n\nThe first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31.\n\nBy January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge.\n\nThe first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.\n\nWhere does the virus come from?\n\nAccording to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals \u2013 the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively.\n\nThe first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation.\n\nAlthough the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat.\n\nA study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats.\n\nHowever, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was.\n\nDr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China.\n\n'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.'\n\nSo far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it?\n\nExperts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly.\n\nIt is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19.\n\nAnother reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold.\n\nSpeaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them.\n\n'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.'\n\nIf the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die.\n\n'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in.\n\n'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.'\n\nHow does the virus spread?\n\nThe illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms.\n\nIt is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nOriginally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person.\n\nWhat does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms?\n\nOnce someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms \u2013 but they may still be contagious during this time.\n\nIf and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all.\n\nIn a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people.\n\nFigures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why.\n\nWhat have genetic tests revealed about the virus?\n\nScientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world.\n\nThis allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause.\n\nExaminations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much \u2013 changing is known as mutating \u2013 much during the early stages of its spread.\n\nHowever, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people.\n\nThis means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it.\n\nMore study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately.\n\nHow dangerous is the virus?\n\nThe virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people.\n\nExperts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is.\n\nHowever, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true.\n\nDr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.\n\nCan the virus be cured?\n\nThe COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain.\n\nAntibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money.\n\nNo vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology.\n\nCurrently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people.\n\nPeople who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public.\n\nAnd airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature).\n\nHowever, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport.\n\nIs this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic?\n\nThe outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11.

In a small proportion of patients, COVID-19 can cause death, particularly among those who are older or who have chronic medical conditions. Symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Symptoms appear within 14 days of being exposed to an infectious person. COVID-19 spreads primarily through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nTo lower the risk of respiratory germ spread, including COVID-19, the Virginia Department of Health encourages the following effective behaviors:\n\n\u2022 Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.\n\n\u2022 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.\n\n\u2022 Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.\n\n\u2022 Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\n\u2022 Stay home when you are sick.\n\n\u2022 Avoid contact with sick people.\n\n\u2022 Avoid non-essential travel.\n\nFor the latest factual information on COVID-19, you're encouraged to check both the Virginia Department of Health and the CDC.\n\n","category":"state_of_emergency","population":2323.0,"lat":38.4875,"lng":-78.6172}

Larry Hogan, a Republican, issued an executive order on Monday tightening previous restrictions placed on residents and businesses. The order takes effect at 8 p.m. on Monday.\n\nShortly after, Virginia and Washington, D.C., followed suit. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, ordered residents to stay at home until June 10. \"This is an unprecedented and difficult time,\" he said.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser tweeted that, \"Staying at home is the best way to flatten the curve and protect yourself, your family, and our entire community from COVID-19.\" The order will go into effect at midnight on April 1.\n\nIn all three orders, people are allowed to leave their homes only for essential reasons, such as obtaining food and medicine or going to work if their job is considered essential. Some outdoor exercise is permitted, as long as people practice social distancing. Violators could be guilty of a misdemeanor and face imprisonment or fines.\n\nCombined, the order covers more than 15 million people.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe mayor of Washington, D.C. and the governors of Maryland and Virginia have ordered their residents to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus, putting over 15 million people on lockdown as the region experiences an uptick in confirmed cases.\n\nThe orders essentially demand a shutdown of the entire Capital region, with residents instructed to leave home only for essential activities such as food, medicine, caring for family, and limited forms of outdoor exercise.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan officially ordered residents to stay at home on Monday. A few hours later, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam followed suit, telling residents they needed to stay at home until June 10. By late afternoon, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser completed the shutdown of the Capital region, officially ordering city dwellers after the city previously shut down all non-essential businesses.\n\nBoth governors lamented that some residents had continued to go out and gather, despite both states banning gatherings of more than ten people to prevent viral transmission.\n\nThe Washington D.C., Virginia, and Maryland region saw a sharp rise in coronavirus cases this month.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Maryland had 1,413 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, according to the state's department of health. So far 15 people have died and over 300 have been hospitalized. By Monday afternoon, Virginia had confirmed a total of 1,020 COVID-19 cases and 25 deaths, per its health department.\n\nMeanwhile, in Washington, D.C., 401 people had tested positive and 9 had died as of Sunday, March 29.\n\n\u2014Governor Larry Hogan (@GovLarryHogan) March 30, 2020\n\nWashington, D.C.'s stay-at-home order is the \"best way to flatten the curve,\" mayor says.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Bowser tweeted that \"due to an increasing number of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in DC and across the region and the nation, I've issued a stay-at-home order for the District of Columbia.\"\n\nThe city's residents were already barred from gathering in large groups, and non-essential businesses had been ordered to close. Restaurants could still fill take out and delivery orders, however, though many establishments have opted to close for financial and safety reasons.\n\n\u2014Mayor Muriel Bowser #StayHomeDC (@MayorBowser) March 30, 2020\n\nBowser's order takes effect at midnight on April 1.\n\nIt permits Washingtonians to leave their home for essential activities such as grocery shopping, obtaining medical care that cannot be conducted through telemedicine, and certain essential forms of travel.\n\nBut Bowser warned that those willfully violation of the order could be found guilty of a misdemeanor and face a $5,000 fine, up to 90 days of imprisonment, or both.\n\nMaryland is \"no longer asking\" people to stay home. It's now mandatory.\n\n\"This is a deadly public-health crisis,\" Hogan said. \"We are no longer asking, or suggesting that Marylanders stay home. We are directing them to do so.\"\n\nThe stay-at-home order takes effect at 8 p.m. on Monday.\n\nAnyone who violates the order would be guilty of a misdemeanor, Hogan said, and if convicted could face jail time or a fine up to $5,000.\n\n\"No Maryland resident should be leaving their home unless it is for an essential job, or for an essential reason, such as obtaining food or medicine, seeking urgent medical attention, or for other necessary purposes,\" Hogan said.\n\nThe executive order signed by Hogan provides a full list of \"essential\" activities that include caring for pets, relatives, and friends. The order permits outdoor exercise in forms such as walking, hiking, running, or biking, but they cannot be conducted in groups of more than 10 people.\n\nMaryland began taking action to impose social-distancing orders earlier this month. The governor declared a state of emergency on March 5, and on March 23 he ordered all nonessential businesses to close and told residents to avoid groups of 10 people or more. Monday's executive order updates those directives to a stay-at-home directive.\n\nBut Hogan said many residents were still not listening.\n\n\"Despite all of those actions and our repeated warnings for more than three weeks, and in spite of the rapid escalation of this crisis across the world, the nation, and our state, some people are still choosing to ignore those executive orders and directives.\n\n\"Those individuals are endangering themselves and their fellow citizens,\" Hogan said.\n\nVirginia's governor orders residents to stay at home after 'beaches and recreational areas were literally packed.'\n\n\"It is clear more people need to hear this basic message: stay home,\" Northam said at a Monday press conference, after lamenting that people still flocked to beaches and parks despite orders from the government to practice social distancing.\n\nUnder Northam's order, residents would need to stay at home except to conduct essential tasks, and the order will be in effect until June 10. \"It will take time to show results,\" he said.\n\nVirginia's stay-at-home order is similar to Maryland's in regards to what activity is allowed and prohibited. People could leave their homes for essential reasons, such as buying groceries, caring for animals or family members, getting exercise as long as they practiced social distancing.\n\nBut any parties or social gatherings of more than 10 people were prohibited. Beaches would be closed to any activity except exercising or fishing, he said, and people should not go to the store unless they needed to stock up on multiple items.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented and difficult time,\" Northam said. \"And it will be hard for people.\"\n\nRead more: These Republican governors are ordering everyone to stay home because of coronavirus, defying Trump's impatience to reopen the economy","category":"shelter_in_place","population":127.0,"lat":38.7122,"lng":-78.1598}

It wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether Trump\u2019s latest move changes GM\u2019s plans with Ventec.\n\nA person familiar with the plans between GM and Ventec said Trump invoking the act was a \u201cpure political move\u201d and face-saving attempt that changes nothing, given the companies had already announced plans to next week start producing up to 10,000 potentially life-saving ventilators a month for patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\n\u201cHe has to blame someone because of his administration\u2019s lack of urgency,\u201d said the person, who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nThe Korean War-era statute invoked by Trump can force certain American companies to produce materials considered essential during a national emergency.\n\n\u201cOur negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course. GM was wasting time,\u201d Trump said in a statement.\n\nVentec and GM said in an earlier joint news release Friday that their combined supply networks had \u201cdeveloped sourcing plans\u201d for enough of the more than 700 parts to build 200,000 machines if the government needed them. The ventilators will be built at GM\u2019s 2.6-million-square-foot manufacturing facility in Kokomo, Indiana, and begin shipping at the end of April.\n\nAdvertising\n\nGM, based in Detroit, will deploy 1,000 of its workers to expand production of the ventilators.\n\nThe companies announced their decision to move forward despite the fact that the Trump administration had not committed to a price for the ventilators and pulled back from a previously planned midweek announcement of the venture. In their release, they pledged to ramp up production to a peak of 10,000 a month, \u201cwith the infrastructure and capability to scale much further.\u2019\u2019\n\nBefore that announcement, Trump on Friday morning blasted the automaker and its CEO on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAs usual with \u2018this\u2019 General Motors, things just never seem to work out,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators \u2018very quickly\u2019. Now they are saying it will only be 6,000 in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke \u2018P\u2019.\u201d\n\nA follow-up tweet said that \u201cInvoke P\u201d referred to the Defense Production Act.\n\nAdvertising\n\nTrump had been escalating a war of words with politicians and medical experts who differ with him over how many ventilators are needed. On Thursday, Trump questioned New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s assertions his state needs at least 30,000 ventilators to meet an anticipated onslaught of COVID-19 patients.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they\u2019re going to be,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Fox News host Sean Hannity. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. You know, you go into major hospitals sometimes they\u2019ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they\u2019re saying, \u2018Can we order 30,000 ventilators?\u2019\u201d\n\nWashington state health officials on Friday could not provide information on the projected need for ventilators and the number currently available.\n\nBeth Zborowski, spokeswoman for the Washington State Hospital Association, said her organization also did not have information on the number and projected need.\n\n\u201cI only have ICU and semi-ICU beds,\u201d she said in an email, referring to 1,685 intensive care beds for critically ill patients and 1,652 semi-ICU beds statewide.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that ICU beds will always have a ventilator and that there may not be a one-to-one ratio of ventilators for semi-ICU beds, but there will be some,\u201d Zborowski said.\n\nShe said semi-ICU beds are for patients who don\u2019t need the same level of care as those in ICU, but still need critical care and might be on a ventilator.\n\nIt\u2019s possible some hospitals might have more ventilators than they have beds, Zborowski said.\n\nShe said it is important to note that numbers of patients on ventilators or using ICU beds will fluctuate, and that other patients suffering from heart attacks, strokes, flu and pneumonia also might require the devices.\n\n\u201cThe state is working to get an additional supply of ventilators and there is an effort underway to understand how many ventilators are available, meaning not currently in use,\u201d she said.\n\nA new University of Washington analysis estimates nearly 20,000 patients nationwide will need ventilators to keep them alive when hospitalizations peak. In Washington, the estimate is 236, and it is not clear whether the state will have enough of the machines, according to the hospital association.\n\nThe Washington State Department of Health on Friday announced an additional 516 cases and 28 deaths from COVID-19. The newly released numbers bring the total of confirmed cases in Washington to 3,723, with 175 deaths.\n\nAdvertising\n\nBenton, Chelan, Clark, Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish and Whatcom counties reported new deaths Friday. The bulk of the cases remain in King County, which also reported new cases and has now confirmed 1,828 infections and 125 deaths.\n\nPeople familiar with the GM-Ventec talks have said Ventec has handled all of the negotiating with the government on price. The joint news release indicated GM was providing its Indiana plant \u201cat cost\u201d to the Bothell company.\n\nThe New York Times on Thursday night reported that Ventec sought $1 billion for up to 80,000 of its ventilators. But one person familiar with the talks said $1 billion represents the total amount the government would allocate to all ventilator suppliers, not just Ventec \u2014 which would have the direct federal contract, while GM would be the company\u2019s subcontractor. In Ventec\u2019s case, he added, the company had asked for \u201cbetween $200 million and $300 million\u201d mainly so it could front the cost of ordering parts from suppliers worldwide with unprecedented speed.\n\nGM issued a release immediately after Trump invoked the Defense Production Act on Friday afternoon, stating: \u201cVentec, GM and our supply base have been working around the clock for over a week to meet this urgent need. Our commitment to build Ventec\u2019s high quality critical care ventilator, VOCSN, has never wavered.\u201d\n\nVentec\u2019s VOCSN, approved by the FDA two years ago, is a multifunction ventilator, priced midway between the $5,000 for a typical home-care device and $50,000 for top-end intensive care unit (ICU) hospital models. At 18 pounds with a nine-hour battery, it combines five separate pieces of equipment \u2013 a ventilator, oxygen source, cough assist pump, suction unit and medication-delivery nebulizer \u2014 into one, making it practical for rapid deployment to remote locales or triage centers.\n\nVOCSN\u2019s combined unit also reduces the number of medical personnel needed to manage patients in more confined emergency spaces. A typical ICU device requires a critical care doctor, respiratory therapist and a nurse to monitor multiple pieces of equipment.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u201cThis pandemic is unprecedented and so is the response, with incredible support from GM and their suppliers,\u2019\u2019 Ventec CEO Chris Kiple said in the release. \u201cHealth care professionals on the front lines deserve the best tools to treat patients and precision critical care ventilators like VOCSN are what is necessary to save lives.\u2019\u2019\n\nThose familiar with ventilator production and car manufacturing plants say it would be next to impossible for Ventec and GM to deliver 40,000 machines \u201cright away\u201d as Trump\u2019s tweet suggested.\n\nTodd Olson, CEO of Minneapolis-based Twin City Die Castings \u2014 supplying about 20 of the parts that Ventec and GM will use \u2014 said it will take several weeks before the companies can hit their targeted capacity.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go from zero to 10,000 or 20,000 or something like that,\u201d Olson said. \u201cEven General Motors themselves probably couldn\u2019t do it [with cars]. It\u2019s going to take a period probably through the summer to ramp up to maximum capacity. But they\u2019ll make a meaningful difference with units out in I think, a month or two.\u201d\n\nErik Gordon, a University of Michigan professor specializing in entrepreneurship and technology commercialization \u2014 who closely follows GM and the automotive industry \u2014 said it would take time to reconfigure the automaker\u2019s assembly line to start producing volumes in the tens of thousands.\n\n\u201cGM is used to very high volume assembly but their plants are custom-built to design particular categories of vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, it isn\u2019t like you can just say \u2018Close down this assembly line at the Buick plant on Friday and on Monday we\u2019re going to make ventilators, or toaster ovens or refrigerators.\u201d\n\nOne scenario had the companies producing up to 20,000 ventilators a month by August. Reaching 10,000 a month is expected to happen far sooner, possibly by late spring.\n\n\u201cGM is in the position to help build more ventilators because of the remarkable performance of GM and Ventec\u2019s global supply base,\u201d GM CEO Barra said in the release announcing the venture. \u201cOur joint teams have moved mountains to find real solutions to save lives and fight the pandemic.\u201d\n\nSeattle Times staff reporter Steve Miletich contributed to this report.\n\nHow is this outbreak affecting you?

No passengers or crew will be allowed to disembark and the timing of the transit wasn\u2019t immediately clear.\n\nHolland America Line said via a Facebook post, \u201cWe greatly appreciate this consideration in the humanitarian interest of our guests and crew\u201d and said it was working with authorities to finalize details.\n\nThe Zaandam and 1,243 passengers and 586 crew left Argentina on March 7. South American ports began denying it docking on March 15.\n\nHolland America said Friday that four passengers had died of causes it did not describe, and that two had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nPanamanian officials initially denied the ships transit for health reasons. Panamanian pilots and other workers come aboard ships as they make their way through the tricky, narrow passage.\n\n50,000 in Philippines violate quarantine regulations\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 Nearly 50,000 people have violated quarantine regulations and night curfews in the Philippines and officials warn that police will make more arrests to toughen the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar told The Associated Press that 49,333 violators have been apprehended in the two weeks since the main northern island of Luzon and other regions were placed under a month-long lockdown.\n\nMany of those violators were treated leniently and allowed to go home after being warned or fined. But Eleazar says penalties will be stricter due to widespread defiance.\n\nCurfew violators would be locked up if local ordinances in provinces and cities allow such arrests. Authorities will look for detention centres big enough to allow \u201csocial distancing\u201d among those who will be arrested.\n\nOfficials on Sunday reported 343 new cases of the COVID-19 disease, bringing the country\u2019s total to 1,418, including 71 deaths. It\u2019s the biggest-single day jump in infections as the Philippines acquired more test kits and opened more testing centres.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases\n\nTOKYO \u2014 Health officials in a Japanese prefecture of Chiba, near Tokyo, reported a total of 86 confirmed cases of the virus over the weekend in a mass infection at a facility for people with mental disabilities.\n\nThe Chiba prefecture said 58 people tested positive at the facility Hokuso Ikuseien on Saturday. Infections of 28 more people at the facility and their families were confirmed Sunday.\n\nAnother 26 staff members at Eiju General Hospital tested positive in Tokyo, where rapid increase of new cases have prompted the Japanese capital to request its residents to stay home. Tokyo reported 68 new cases Sunday, a new record for a single-day increase, bringing a prefectural total to about 430.\n\nJapan has more than 2,400 cases, including 712 infected on a quarantined cruise ship near Tokyo, with 62 deaths.\n\nSerbia: Angry dog owners flood social networks\n\nBELGRADE, Serbia \u2014 Pet owners in Serbia are furious over the populist government\u2019s decision to ban even a brief walk for people with dogs during an evening curfew to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nAngry dog owners have flooded social networks, warning that the ban could harm their dogs\u2019 health and cause frustration and anxiety for both the animals and their owners.\n\nVeterinarian Nenad Milojkovic said protecting animal rights is a test for a society during hard times such as an epidemic. He said skipping the evening walk could worsen the condition for the dogs with urinary problems and \u201caggravate basic hygienic conditions in people\u2019s homes.\u201d\n\nSerbia\u2019s government made the decision on Saturday, revoking a previously introduced 20-minute permission for dog owners to walk their pets.\n\nSerbia has imposed some of the harshest measures in Europe against the spread of the new coronavirus, including a total ban on movement for people over 65 years and a curfew from 5 p.m. until 5 a.m.\n\nRandom coronavirus checks come to Norway\n\nOSLO, Norway \u2014 Norwegian health authorities say they are set to start performing random coronavirus tests, following the experiment Iceland has done.\n\nCiting officials at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Norwegian public broadcaster NRK said Sunday such random testing among all citizens will provide answers to two key questions: how many of those who appear to be infected actually have the coronavirus and how wide the spread of the virus is.\n\nNRK said Iceland, with its 12,000 random tests among its population of 340,000, has the largest number of tests per capita in the world. Norway, a nation of 5.4 million, has so far reported 4,054 coronavirus cases with 25 deaths.\n\nPope calls for cease-fire in all conflicts\n\nVATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Francis is backing the U.N. chief\u2019s call for a cease-fire in all conflicts raging across the globe to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. He also said his thoughts are with those constrained to live in groups, citing in particular rest homes for the elderly, military barracks and jails.\n\nDuring his traditional Sunday blessing, the pope called for `\u2019the creation of humanitarian aid corridors, the opening of diplomacy and attention to those who are in situations of great vulnerability.\u201d\n\nHe cited U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 appeal this past week for a global truce `\u2019to focus together on the true fight of our lives\u201d against the coronavirus.\n\nFrancis, as he has throughout most of the coronavirus emergency due to bans on public gatherings, addressed the faithful from his private library in the Apostolic Palace, and not from a window overlooking St. Peter\u2019s Square as is tradition.\n\nFlights resume in China\u2019s coronavirus epicentre\n\nBEIJING \u2014 Airline flights from the Chinese province at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak resumed Sunday in another step toward lifting restrictions that kept tens of millions of people at home.\n\nThe first flight took off from Yichang, a city in Hubei province, bound for the eastern city of Fuzhou with 64 passengers, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\n\nMost access to Wuhan, the city where the first coronavirus cases were reported in December, was suspended on Jan. 23. Restrictions spread to other cities in Hubei, cutting train, air and road links.\n\nThe government has been gradually relaxing restrictions since the Communist Party declared victory over the outbreak. Subway and bus service in Wuhan resumed Saturday and the city\u2019s train station reopen.\n\nAirports in Hubei were scheduled to have a total of 98 departing flights on Sunday, Xinhua reported.\n\nSpain: Daily deaths hit a sombre new record\n\nMADRID \u2014 Spain says it has hit a new daily record for coronavirus deaths with 838 fatalities in the last 24 hours for a total of 6,528, the world\u2019s second-highest death count behind Italy.\n\nSunday\u2019s number is slightly up from Saturday, when 832 people were reported to have died from the virus.\n\nThe number of infections rose by more than 6,500 from Saturday to Sunday for a new total of 78,797. The rate of that increase in infections, however, continues to decrease.\n\nSpain has been in lockdown for two weeks under a national state of emergency. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez\u2019s Cabinet will approve on Sunday a new decree to tighten those controls and impede workers from commuting to work in all industries unrelated to health care and food production and distribution for two weeks.\n\nCoronavirus","category":"disaster_declaration","population":226.0,"lat":47.7595,"lng":-118.52}

We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear,\u201d said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief.\n\n\u201cAll countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in the response,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are deeply concerned by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction.\u201d\n\nThe WHO added that Iran and Italy are the new front lines of the battle against the virus that started in China.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re suffering but I guarantee you other countries will be in that situation soon,\u201d said Dr. Mike Ryan, the WHO\u2019s emergencies chief.\n\nItaly weighed imposing even tighter restrictions on daily life and announced billions in financial relief Wednesday to cushion economic shocks from the coronavirus, its latest efforts to adjust to the fast-evolving health crisis that silenced the usually bustling heart of the Catholic faith, St. Peter\u2019s Square.\n\nIn Iran, by far the hardest-hit country in the Middle East, the senior vice-president and two other Cabinet ministers were reported to have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. Iran reported another jump in deaths, by 62 to 354 \u2014 behind only China and Italy.\n\nREAD MORE: Novel coronavirus outbreak affecting Canadians\u2019 March break travel plans\n\nREAD MORE: Trudeau promises $1 billion for COVID-19 research, resilience\n\nIn Italy, Premier Giuseppe Conte said he would consider requests from Lombardy, Italy\u2019s hardest-hit region, to toughen the already extraordinary anti-virus lockdown that was extended nationwide Tuesday. Lombardy wants to shut down nonessential businesses and reduce public transportation.\n\nThese additional measures would be on top of travel and social restrictions that imposed an eerie hush on cities and towns across the country from Tuesday. Police enforced rules that customers stay 1 metre (3 feet) apart and ensured that businesses closed by 6 p.m.\n\nMilan shopkeeper Claudia Sabbatini said she favoured stricter measures. Rather than run the risk of customers possibly infecting each other in her children\u2019s clothing store, she decided to close it.\n\n\u201cI cannot have people standing at a distance. Children must try on the clothes. We have to know if they will fit,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nConte said fighting Italy\u2019s more than 10,000 infections \u2014 the biggest outbreak outside of China \u2014 must not come at the expense of civil liberties. His caution suggested that Italy is unlikely to adopt the draconian quarantine measures that helped China push down new infections from thousands per day to a trickle now and allowed its manufacturers to restart production lines.\n\nChina\u2019s new worry is that the coronavirus could re-enter from abroad. Beijing\u2019s city government announced that all overseas visitors will be quarantined for 14 days. Of 24 new cases that China reported Wednesday, five arrived from Italy and one from the United States. China has had over 81,000 virus infections and over 3,000 deaths.\n\nFor most, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. But for a few, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia. More than 121,000 people have been infected worldwide and over 4,300 have died.\n\nBut the vast majority of people recover. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.\n\nIn the Mideast, the vast majority of the nearly 10,000 cases are in Iran or involve people who travelled there. Iran announced another increase in cases Wednesday to 9,000. Iran\u2019s semiofficial Fars news agency said they include Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri, who had not been seen in photos of recent top-level meetings. Fars said Iran\u2019s ministers for cultural heritage, handcrafts and tourism, and for industry, mines and business were also infected.\n\nREAD MORE: B.C. officials confirm 7 new COVID-19 cases, including two health care workers\n\nREAD MORE: Think before you buy or sell stocks amid COVID-19 market turmoil, B.C. professor urges\n\nCases in Qatar jumped from 24 to 262. Kuwait announced a two-week shutdown of the country.\n\nFor the global economy, virus repercussions were profound, with increasing concerns of wealth- and job-wrecking recessions. U.S. stocks sank again in early trading Wednesday, wiping out most of a huge rally from a day earlier as Wall Street continues to reel from worries about the coronavirus.\n\nThe Wall Street plunge followed a steep decline by markets across Asia, where governments there and elsewhere have announced billions of dollars in stimulus funds, including packages revealed in Japan on Tuesday and Australia on Wednesday.\n\nItaly\u2019s government announced Wednesday it was earmarking 25 billion euros (nearly $28 billion) to boost anti-virus efforts and soften economic blows, including delaying tax and mortgage payments by families and businesses.\n\nBritain\u2019s government announced a 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) economic stimulus package and the Bank of England slashed its key interest rate by half a percentage point to 0.25%.\n\nNormal life was increasingly being upended.\n\nWith police barring access to St. Peter\u2019s Square, emptying it of tens of thousands of people who usually come on Wednesdays for the weekly papal address, Pope Francis instead live-streamed prayers from the privacy of his Vatican library.\n\nIn France, the government\u2019s weekly Cabinet meeting was moved to a bigger room so President Emmanuel Macron and his ministers could sit at least 1 metre (more than 3 feet) apart.\n\nAthletes who usually thrive on crowds grew increasingly wary of them. Spanish soccer club Getafe said it wouldn\u2019t travel to Italy to play Inter Milan, preferring to forfeit their Europa League match rather than risk infections.\n\nOlympic champion skier Mikaela Shiffrin said she would be limiting contact with fans and fellow competitors, tweeting that \u201cthis means no selfies, autographs, hugs, high fives, handshakes or kiss greetings.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S., the caseload passed 1,000, and outbreaks on both sides of the country stirred alarm.\n\nFormer U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who are vying to take on President Donald Trump in the presidential election, abruptly cancelled rallies Tuesday and left open the possibility that future campaign events could be impacted, too. Trump\u2019s campaign insisted it would proceed as normal, although Vice-President Mike Pence conceded future rallies would be evaluated \u201con a day to day basis.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, deaths soared among Italy\u2019s aging population. Authorities said Italy has suffered 631 deaths, with an increase of 168 fatalities recorded Tuesday. In Spain, the number of cases surged past the 2,000-mark on Wednesday. Belgium, Bulgaria, Sweden, Albania and Ireland all announced their first virus-related deaths.\n\n\u201cIf you want to be blunt, Europe is the new China,\u201d said Robert Redfield, the head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAlso sounding the alarm at a Congressional hearing in Washington was Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\n\u201cBottom line, it\u2019s going to get worse,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said that if the virus is not halted by vaccines and cures, up to 70% of the country\u2019s 83 million people could ultimately become infected, citing estimates that epidemiologists have been putting forward for several weeks. Germany has some 1,300 confirmed infection. Merkel\u2019s comments fit a pattern of government officials using sobering warnings to try to get people to protect themselves, most notably by washing their hands and not gathering in large numbers.\n\nDozens of cases have been tied to a conference in Boston, and leaders in multiple states were announcing curbs on large events. Colleges emptied their classrooms as they moved to online instruction and uncertainty surrounded the upcoming opening of the major league baseball season and college basketball\u2019s championships. Even the famed buffets of Las Vegas were affected, with some of the Strip\u2019s biggest being closed as a precaution.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrifying,\u201d said Silvana Gomez, a student at Harvard University, where undergraduates were told to leave campus by Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m definitely very scared right now about what the next couple days, the next couple weeks look like.\u201d\n\n___\n\nBarry reported from Soave, Italy; Leicester reported from Paris.

Officials from the city\u2019s emergency management division, South King Fire and Rescue, Federal Way Public Schools and others also presented. Courtesy photo\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: The Mirror has updated this story to reflect that Mayor Jim Ferrell signed a proclamation on Monday morning declaring a state of emergency after our initial story that stated he hadn\u2019t decided to do so by the end of the business day on Friday, March 6.\n\nFederal Way Mayor Jim Ferrell declared a state of emergency Monday morning, signing the proclamation and following suit of neighboring jurisdictions who took similar measures last week due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\u201cIn light of the developing situation, [the city] thought it would be legally prudent to issue the proclamation and make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can as a city to ensure the safety of our community,\u201d the mayor told the Mirror just minutes after signing the proclamation.\n\nFerrell said his decision was prompted by further review of the situation, and consultation with city emergency manager Ray Gross, Federal Way city attorney Ryan Call and the newly constituted outbreak advisory team.\n\nDeclaring a local state of emergency provides the city with the option to make emergency purchases without the need to go through the formal process. While the city is not contemplating any emergency purchases at the moment, Ferrell said he wanted to show his constituents the city is taking the situation \u2014 and their well-being \u2014 seriously.\n\nThe outbreak advisory team consists of department directors and other key staff members in a multi-disciplinary team to address all the issues that could potentially be impacted by COVID-19, Ferrell said. The team will be meeting every week and as necessary.\n\nIn addition to the declaration, Ferrell said the city has decided to cancel all non-mandatory meetings that occur at City Hall through March 31, which includes commission meetings and other larger group meetings, such as the upcoming all-city staff meeting scheduled for March 24.\n\nThis decision excludes City Council and committee meetings, although staff will be communicating with council about the possibility of accomplishing committee meetings virtually. The March 17 council meeting will be held as scheduled.\n\nFerrell said the widespread nature of the outbreak throughout the country, combined with the actions taken by regional partners and the state government, prompted him to declare a state of emergency. His staff on March 6 had told the Mirror that the mayor believed their was no need to declare an emergency at that time.\n\n\u201cThe mayor believes there\u2019s no need to do that now,\u201d Tyler Hemstreet, the city\u2019s communications coordinator, told the Mirror on March 6. \u201cWe would be taking all those cues from Public Health \u2026 The situation would have to be a lot more dire than it is now for us to do that,\u201d Tyler Hemstreet, the city\u2019s communications coordinator, told the Mirror on March 6.\n\nHemstreet said on March 6 the mayor would declare a state of emergency if he needed purchasing power.\n\n\u201cUltimately the only gain to doing that (declaring an emergency) would be to gain power over the purchasing protocols if we needed something to deal with the outbreak that we would have to go to the council to get approved for first or go out to bid,\u201d Hemstreet said.\n\nOr if the city needs to pay Parks Department employees overtime, for example, the city wouldn\u2019t have to negotiate with the union, he added.\n\nSo far, King County Public Health has confirmed one woman in Federal Way tested positive for the virus following her return from South Korea. In addition, Ferrell said during an update to the City Council on Tuesday night that there could likely be more positive coronavirus cases in Federal Way.\n\nCHI Franciscan provided the city with a \u201cheads up\u201d that they are \u201cexpecting several positive COVID-19 test results in the next 24-hours at St. Francis,\u201d Ferrell said at the March 3 meeting. This information was provided to the mayor by Ray Gross, Federal Way city emergency manager, Ferrell said.\n\nA King County Public Health spokesperson told the Mirror as they see more community transmission, they expect to see patients in all hospitals. The spokesperson told the Mirror to reach out to St. Francis for specific case information about their hospital.\n\nHowever, a St. Francis spokesperson declined to provide any information to the Mirror regarding whether any of their patients have tested positive for the virus and said to check with Public Health.\n\nThe mayor did not have any updates on Monday morning about the potential positive cases at St. Francis.\n\nFerrell shared at the March 3 meeting that the novel coronavirus situation is \u201cchanging daily, if not hourly.\u201d\n\nWhile the mayor declared a state of emergency, he has not activated the city\u2019s Emergency Operations Center yet as the EOC leadership does not think that it is necessary to do so yet, Ferrell said.\n\nThe EOC would open when resource management, information management and policy discussion is needed, such as the February 2019 snowmageddon.\n\nMeanwhile, at least nine of the 39 cities throughout the county issued a proclamation of civil emergency and activated their emergency operations centers last week, including the city of Auburn Mayor Nancy Backus\u2019s declaration on March 5 and Renton Mayor Armondo Pavone declared a state of emergency on March 6.\n\nAt the moment, Hemstreet said there is no issue with resource management or policy questions, therefore there is not a need to open the the emergency center in Federal Way.\n\nHe pointed to the city of Redmond as an example of a jurisdiction that needs help with resource management. Redmond Mayor Angela Birney declared a proclamation of local emergency on March 2, as seven Redmond fire medics and one Redmond police officer were quarantined after being exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nHemstreet noted that as Ferrell weighs whether to activate Federal Way\u2019s EOC, he has spoken with mayors in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe center in Federal Way is operated by the city\u2019s emergency manager, the mayor and designated staff, along with staff from Federal Way Police, South King Fire and Rescue, city Public Works, Parks, legal and public information officers.\n\nIn some cases, additional management may include staff from Lakehaven Water Sewer District, the Federal Way Public Schools district and St. Francis Hospital.\n\nVolunteers from the Amateur Radio Club and the Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) also help in a crisis situation.\n\n\u201cThe primary purpose of the EOC is to manage limited resources, gain situational awareness, establish priorities of response, start recovery planning, establish joint policy, conduct unified information release,\u201d according to Hemstreet.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"state_of_emergency","population":96690.0,"lat":47.309,"lng":-122.3359}

Caulfield proclaimed a state of emergency in the city of Lakewood in response to COVID-19. The Lakewood City Council ratified the declaration at its meeting the same evening.\n\nThe declaration is a proactive move on behalf of the city, which has currently seen minimal disruptions to its day-to-day operations due to COVID-19. However, the community, including residents, families, students and businesses have experienced severe disruption to their daily lives due to the increased diagnoses of COVID-19 across the state, including the region\u2019s three largest counties: King, Snohomish and Pierce.\n\nHaving the proclamation of civil emergency in place allows city leaders to take necessary and extraordinary measures that are required to inhibit a dramatic spike in occurrences of COVID-19. It also acknowledges that the city\u2019s response will require the use of all city resources and as a result means the city will need to access state and federal resources, including financial assistance.\n\nCurrently City Hall is operating on regular business hours (8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.), however visitors are asked to remain home if experiencing flu-like symptoms or other illness. Visitors are also asked to practice social distancing and remain six feet from public counter space in an effort to limit the potential spread of the virus.\n\nThe city\u2019s police officers are equipped with personal protective equipment for responding to incidents where people may be sick, and are taking extra precautions and steps to limit public contacts.\n\nAdditionally, the Lakewood Senior Activity Center implemented a temporary closure effective March 17 to March 31 out of an abundance of caution for its active older adult members. The center will reassess at the end of the month whether it can reopen based on the recommendations of public health officials.\n\nThe city urges all residents at this time to follow the directives of public health officials. It also encourages residents to support one another and help neighbors or friends if they are unable to grocery shop or get items they need. We also encourage residents to support local business where you can, either through purchasing food to-go from restaurants that are no longer allowed to offer dine-in seating, or by other means.\n\nThe city also urges its residents to find ways to relieve the stress and anxiety felt right now in light of the uncertainty around this situation. City parks and trails are open and are a great stress reliever \u2013 especially if you put away your phone and enjoy the beauty around you.\n\nThe city thanks all of its residents for coming together during this time and encourages people to stay up to date on the latest health directives from the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":60296.0,"lat":47.1628,"lng":-122.5299}

It also allows the council to convene on short notice, rather than following usual notification requirements.\n\nThe coronavirus has already changed how the council operates. To maintain safe distances between council members and attendees Thursday night, the chairs in the council chamber were spaced 6 feet apart. The council met in a separate workshop room but a video feed was streamed into the chamber so the public could watch.\n\nFour council members -- Chet Makinster, Hillary Strobel, Ruth Kendall and Christine Schott -- attended the meeting through video calls from home. Regular council meeting attendee George Brajcich was the only member of the public in attendance.\n\nCity Attorney Jim McNamara said there is no time frame on the emergency declaration. However, it is directly tied to the coronavirus outbreak, so when that crisis dies down, the need for the emergency declaration naturally would die down as well, he said.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":65619.0,"lat":46.146,"lng":-122.963}

Burney will retain his role for the foreseeable future, as the search for a permanent hire has been suspended because of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cThere will be an online certification form to submit with a box to check,\u201d Burney said of the utility safeguard. \u201cAt the end of it, we\u2019ll work with folks on a payment plan.\u201d\n\nThe city also will waive the fee retailers are required to charge customers for use of paper bags. Offering free paper bags will help reduce the level of contact store workers have with reusable bags brought in from customers\u2019 homes.\n\nBurney also noted that temporary lodging is being provided for some homeless people at severe risk from COVID-19. He specified after the meeting that the city has partnered with the county to secure 10 rooms for people who have been living at the mitigation site downtown. He declined to specify the location of those rooms.\n\nWhile Olympia will continue to provide essential services during the emergency period, all city buildings will be closed through at least March 31. City parks and bathrooms remain open, but playgrounds will be cordoned off.\n\nHomeless services and building inspections also will continue as planned.\n\nOlympia police officers will continue responding to the most significant calls for help, such as ones where the suspect is present or there is an immediate threat to person or property, but will begin handling less severe situations via telephone. Online crime reporting portals are available. The Olympia Police Department business offices will be closed to the public until at least March 31.\n\nThe city will look for guidance from the state when it comes to additional measures, such as potential relief for mortgages or rent and a freeze on evictions. Mayor Cheryl Selby said those actions aren\u2019t as easily under the purview of the city.\n\nMayor Pro-tem Jessica Bateman, who is running for state legislator, said Tuesday that she\u2019s heard Gov.

The legislation came together in little more than a week \u2014 and more than triples Trump\u2019s request \u2014 sped along by fears of the outbreak\u2019s growing threat.\n\nTrump is sure to sign the measure, which has the blessing of top Republicans like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and top House Republican Kevin McCarthy of California.\n\n\u201cThis moment calls for collaboration and unity,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to give our public health experts and healthcare professionals the surge resources they need at this challenging time.\u201d\n\nThe agreement came together after Pelosi, D-Calif., dropped a demand, opposed by Republicans and the drug industry, to guarantee that any vaccines and drug treatments developed with government-backed research \u2014 but manufactured by drug companies \u2014 be offered at \u201caffordable\u201d prices. Pelosi opted to avoid a confrontation that could have delayed the legislation\u2019s path through Congress.\n\nInstead, more than $3 billion would be dedicated to research and development on vaccines, medicines for treatment, and diagnostic tests, including $300 million for the government to purchase such drugs from manufacturers at \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d prices to distribute them to those who need it \u2014 which is the standard applied in earlier crises like the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak.\n\nIt also would provide more than $2 billion to help federal, state and local governments prepare for and respond to the coronavirus threat, including $300 million for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s rapid response fund. Another $1.3 billion would be used to help fight the virus overseas.\n\nAlmost $1 billion would provide medical supplies and other preparedness steps: $350 million to aggressively go after the virus in \u201chot spots\u201d like Washington state; $500 million to buy drugs, masks and other medical supplies for states, local governments and hospitals; and $100 million for community health centers. It would devote $500 million to Medicare for remote \u201ctelehealth\u201d consultations that would permit sick people to get treatment without visiting a doctor.\n\n\u201cThis robust, bipartisan agreement goes far above the President\u2019s totally inadequate request to actually meet the needs we are hearing from our states and will help ensure tests and vaccines are available to everyone who needs them,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.\n\nThe legislation comes as the outbreak in the U.S. appears increasingly likely to affect workers who would be instructed to stay home, immigrants who may fear seeking treatment because they are in the U.S. illegally, and homeless people. Widespread school closures are possible as well.\n\n\u201cThe American people are apprehensive about the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. and abroad. Global financial markets are on edge,\u201d said Sen.

The 90-day proclamation of emergency was issued at 1 p.m. Monday. It cited declarations on the federal level by President Trump, Gov. Inslee at the state level and by the Kitsap Public Health District.\n\nHere is Putaansuu\u2019s message:\n\nAs your Mayor, I\u2019m here to provide leadership to you and the employees of our City who provide necessary services to our Community. Unfortunately, in our recent past, we\u2019ve experienced a tornado and a snowstorm that shuttered our community, but we\u2019ve also witnessed unparalleled compassion and consideration for our neighbors in need when these events unfolded. I\u2019m confident that this event will be no different.\n\nThese are unprecedented times and the information changes on the hour. I wish I had all the answers, but I know the answers differ slightly for each of us. We must remain calm and make decisions based on facts from credible sources like the Kitsap Public Health District, Washington State Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nLinks to all these organizations and facts sheet for what to do if you or someone you know is exposed to the virus can be found at the City of Port Orchard\u2019s website. To keep informed, I encourage everyone to sign up for email bulletins from the Kitsap Public Health District at Kitsappublichealth.org.\n\nWith the information we know today, practicing social distancing to prevent and at least slow the spread of the virus is prudent. Social distancing is a non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) whereby people reduce their risk of contact with infected individuals by:\n\nCreating and using ways to increase the distance between people in settings where people commonly come into close contact (within 6 feet) with others. Avoid gatherings of people where close contact with others is a natural . Everyone should practice the following healthy habits and NPI\u2019s to prevent the spread of COVID-19:\n\nWash your hands often.\n\nCover coughs and sneezes with an elbow or tissue.\n\nAvoid close contact with people who are sick.\n\nClean and disinfect frequently used objects and surfaces.\n\nStay home when you\u2019re sick and avoid close contact with others.\n\nPlease help us by not spreading the virus to City Hall by utilizing the resources found in our City of Port Orchard Preventive Measures, which can be found on our website on the COVID-19 information page.\n\nWe want to be here to assist you but can\u2019t perform our mission if we become ill, too. COVID-19 will have physical, social, emotional and economic impacts to our community, but I also know that in time life as we know it will return to normal.\n\nTake care, stay healthy, but most of all, protect and care for the ones you love.\n\nSincerely\n\nRob Putaansuu\n\nPort Orchard Mayor","category":"state_of_emergency","population":13997.0,"lat":47.5164,"lng":-122.661}

Declares State Of Emergency As Part Of Coronavirus Response","text":"Updated Sunday, March 15, 2020 at 9:50 p.m. Check back here for the latest coverage on the coronavirus.\n\nThe city of Charleston, West Virginia, has declared a state of emergency as part of its response to the coronavirus. According to a news release, Mayor Amy Goodwin signed a proclamation Sunday that allows city officials to issue emergency policies and mobilize resources such as personnel, services and equipment.\n\nCharleston\u2019s state of emergency was issued despite West Virginia reporting no confirmed cases of the virus. The proclamation was issued moments before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the suspension of gatherings of 50 or more people for the next eight weeks.\n\nHowever, testing in the state has been extremely limited. West Virginia health officials say 41 residents have been tested for the disease. As of Sunday at 9:50 p.m., 38 tests yielded negative results with three results still pending. Those numbers do not account for testing conducted by some hospitals or commercial laboratories.\n\nGoodwin said the threat of the coronavirus and its likely inevitable spread in West Virginia could force municipalities such as Charleston to enact lockdowns. She said the emergency declaration would allow her and other city officials to put a lockdown in place should it become necessary.\n\n\"I think that West Virginians need to plan and prepare for that to happen,\" Goodwin said by phone Sunday night. \"[They need to] plan and prepare for social distancing for quite some time; to plan and prepare for this virus to wreak havoc in the state of West Virginia with our businesses and our lives for quite some time.\"\n\nCity officials say the state of emergency will remain in place until a similar proclamation is issued to rescind the measure. Goodwin said she would rather enact policies that keep residents safe than look back and wish she had done more.\n\n\u201cSomebody yelled at me across the street the other day, they said, \u2018Mayor, are we overreacting?\u2019 And my response to them was \u2018Boy, I hope so. But, unfortunately, I don't think so,\u2019\u201d Goodwin said Sunday night by phone. \u201cAs mayor, it's my responsibility. It's my job to ensure that if we need to make critical decisions, life-saving decisions, at a moment's notice that we're able to do that \u2013 and I can't wait on the state or anyone else to do that for our city. We need to do it ourselves.\u201d\n\nGov. Jim Justice said in a Friday news conference that he believes the virus \u2014 which has, as of Sunday night, stricken more than 162,000 people globally and caused more than 6,000 deaths \u2014 is in West Virginia but has not been detected.\n\n\u201cWe know it\u2019s here,\u201d Justice said. \u201c I mean, let\u2019s be real. It has to be here. We just haven\u2019t found it yet.\u201d\n\nJustice and other state officials have taken various steps to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, including closing schools until at least March 27, and suspending visitations at state corrections centers. Universities around the state have also extended their respective spring breaks and are transitioning to online learning environments. The governor has announced a news conference to be held Monday at 2 p.m. to update the status of the state's response to the pandemic.\n\nAlong with the issuance of Charleston\u2019s state of emergency, Mayor Goodwin said Monday\u2019s scheduled meeting of the city council would be held electronically.\n\n\u201cI was very limited in my way of being able to ask members to stay to stay at home,\u201d Goodwin said. \u201cWe can still have counsel, we just need to do it online. Without this declaration, I was not able to do that.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated population of just over 47,000 residents, Charleston is West Virginia\u2019s largest city and the state capital.","category":"state_of_emergency","population":142858.0,"lat":38.3484,"lng":-81.6323}

If they had been approved for paid time-off during the closure, they have to use that allotted time and not use the policy.\n\nThe six Baraboo Common Council members present for the special meeting voted unanimously to update the policy with the new emergency declaration language. Members John Ellington, Scott Sloan and Dennis Thurow were absent.\n\nIf an employee runs out of sick leave when this policy is implemented, they can receive their usual rate of pay up to 40 hours per week until the emergency declaration is ended.\n\nPer the emergency declaration, anyone looking to obtain a license or a permit must complete online applications. Inspection questions can still be sent to Building Inspector Megan Krautkramer. All \u201cnon-essential\u201d committee and commission meetings are also canceled.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).\n\nWash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.
