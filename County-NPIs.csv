Montgomery Advertiser

A circuit judge has amended his order calling for the release of some inmates in Autauga, Elmore and Chilton county jails with bonds under $5,000.

Presiding Circuit Judge Ben Fuller, of Autauga County, entered the order Wednesday afternoon calling for all inmates to be released. The amendment gave sheriffs the discretion on releasing inmates based on their perceived threat to the public. The order states the inmates would be released on their own recognizance in an effort to ease overcrowding over fears of the spread of the coronavirus.

Fuller's actions had law enforcement and other judges in the circuit scrambling. They apparently were not consulted before the original order came down.

Victims and relatives of victims were burning up the phone lines Thursday at the three district attorneys offices in the circuit.

""They were all concerned about the order and just what that meant for their cases,"" said Chief Assistant District Attorney C.J. Robinson. ""We couldn't file the necessary motions we need to file because of all the calls.""

The office is reviewing each case. Release of inmates deemed a threat to the public or law enforcement will be protested.

""We understand the coronavirus pandemic and the potential exposure risks that are on everyone’s mind, but our main concern is to protect our community,"" Robinson wrote in a lengthy post on his Facebook page. ""Make no mistake; the safety of victims will take precedence in our decision-making.""

The Alabama Supreme Court has suspended all court actions due to the fear of the spread of the coronavirus. The exception is proceedings deemed to be emergencies. Robinson said the release protests can be made through court records, and hearings may not be required on each case.

Autauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger was conducting an audit of inmates Wednesday night to determine who would be covered.

""I have the discretion on releasing anyone, whether they can post bond or not,"" Sedinger said. ""If I feel there is a threat to the public, I won't release them.""

The metro holds inmates charged with felonies and inmates arrested on misdemeanor charges by the Prattville Police Department.

""We will be reviewing all our cases that apply,"" said Police Chief Mark Thompson. ""If we feel the person is a threat to the public or a threat to officer safety, we are going to protest their release.""

By noon Thursday, Sedinger had released seven inmates arrested by the Prattville PD on misdemeanor charges, but only after the approval of Thompson.

Elmore County Circuit Judge Bill Lewis Jr. entered a subsequent order following Fuller's original order. Lewis' order tells the sheriffs in all three counties not to release any inmates involved in his cases for five days until he has a chance to review their files.

The circuit is served by three judges, with Sibley Reynolds representing Chilton County.

Most crimes that would get a $5,000 or under bonds are misdemeanors and some Class C and D felonies. District Attorney Randall Houston has concerns.

""If you have a sex offender in jail who has not gotten an approved address to live after release, he may have a $5,000 bond,"" Houston said. ""He gets out under this blanket order..

""My concern is this is a blanket order with the decision made by a judge without consultation of us or other judges. A judge who who has no knowledge of all the cases.""

Crimes on the list that could receive a $5,000 or under bond include criminally negligent homicide, a misdemeanor, some domestic violence cases, some DUI cases, incest, sexual abuse, enticing a child for immoral purposes, escape and some robbery charges.

Experts caution that the highly infectious COVID-19 could wreak havoc in jails and prisons, where the social distancing recommendation public officials are spreading far and wide is impractical at best.

In letters to state leaders in Mississippi, Florida and Louisiana on Tuesday, dozens of civil rights groups urged prison and jail officials to consider releasing some prisoners on compassionate release, such as those with compromised immune systems, older prisoners, prisoners with chronic health issues and pregnant prisoners.

The suggestion isn't without precedent.

In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, local officials began expediting a process to release more than 200 inmates before illness struck. In Los Angeles, officials have begun releasing prisoners with less than 30 days to serve in their sentence, legal under state law, in a bid to reduce the jail's population.

""We are trying to make as much room as possible, so when this virus hits our jail, the jail can deal with these people, quarantine them and deal with it instead of letting them sit there and infect the whole entire jail,"" Brendan Sheehan, administrative judge of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, told CNN.

Commission approves Coosa River toll bridge project,"TALLADEGA, Ala. (WIAT) — The Talladega County Commission has voted to approve licensing for the Coosa River Express. The toll bridge would connect Highway 280 in Sylacauga to Interstate 65 in Calera.

Talladega County Commission passes licensure for Coosa River Express toll bridge project with 5-0 vote. Now the project needs licensing approval from Shelby County. @CBS_42 — Malique (@MaliqueRankin) January 14, 2020

Now that the Coosa River Express has approval from Talladega, Tim James Inc., the company in charge of the project, needs the green light from Shelby County.

Residents of Talladega County came to the commission meeting Monday night with mixed feelings on how this may affect their quiet way of life. “It’s going to be hard to balance that slow, country living, safe setting for our children to go to school during the day, practice in the afternoon and come home safely without fighting the traffic,” said one Talladega county resident.

Not everyone was concerned with traffic and safety. “Because I don’t want the south end of the county, or the county as a whole to fall behind the rest of the state economically,” said another resident.

Several of the residents that spoke during the public input portion of the meeting feel the bridge project would make Sylacauga a more attractive place to live.

One of the speakers at the Monday night meeting was the executive director of the Coosa Riverkeeper. She raised concerns over the environmental impact the project may have. “If Tim James Inc is able to construct this toll bridge on Lay Lake, he may be kicking up dirt with PCB’s. I’m here today because I don’t want to be responsible for telling our children they shouldn’t get into the river because we put economic development over their future,” said Justinn Overton.

Tim James, the man in charge of this project, shut down those claims. “I don’t know what they’re talking about. That’s it. We have the very best environmental engineers there is in this part of the country. They handle the permits…”

Although support for the project was divided, commissioners voted unanimously to give the Coosa River Express a license in Talladega County.

Tim James said we can expect to see his project on Shelby County Commission agendas in the coming months.

Pensacola News Journal

Escambia County Commissioners have ordered that Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key Beach close to the public for two weeks, starting at midnight Friday and lasting until April 2.

After more than three and a half hours of discussion at a special meeting Friday, the commissioners voted unanimously to close all public areas of the county's beaches.

Violating an emergency order during a declared state emergency is a misdemeanor offense.

The board also voted unanimously to have the Bob Sikes tolls go to all-electronic collections immediately, a move that was initially planned for April.

After the vote, Gulf Islands National Seashore announced it would follow the lead of local governments and the Fort Pickens, Perdido Key, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa areas would be closed as of 5 p.m. Friday.

In addition, the county is asking the state of Florida to close its beaches on Perdido Key.

Escambia County's decision to close its beaches was an abrupt departure from officials' message the day prior. On Thursday, Escambia County Commissioner Robert Bender held a press conference to say Pensacola Beach would remain open as members of the hotel industry pledged to limit their occupancy rates to 50%.

Bender said the county would keep the beach open but urged visitors to follow social distancing guidelines, limiting themselves to groups no larger than 10 people and maintaining at least 6 feet of separation.

But hospital executives and Dr. John Lanza, director of the Florida Department of Health in Escambia County, sent a letter to the county Thursday calling on commissioners to take more steps to stop people from gathering in large crowds, including closing beaches.

A similar letter sent to Santa Rosa County Commissioners is what convinced officials there to have a change of heart and close Navarre Beach, said Santa Rosa County Commission Chairman Don Salter.

Also on Friday, Escambia County was going to consider following the city's lead to limit restaurant operations to take-out only, an order Pensacola Mayor Grover Robinson issued Thursday. But that decision was taken out of the County Commission's hands when Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order limiting all restaurants in the state to carryout or delivery only.

Commissioner Doug Underhill said he didn't support measures to limit restaurant services, saying they would hurt local workers and he didn't believe any relief would make it to them from the federal government.

""It's impossible for me to believe that there's this mass infusion from the federal government that is going to be coming in a timely enough fashion to actually protect these workers that I'm most concerned about,"" Underhill said. ""I don't know if you know who these people are, but they live their lives on a very thin margin. The paycheck pays the bills. The tips pay for the groceries.""

Underhill also said there was not enough data about the coronavirus to support making the decision.

Baptist Health Care President and CEO Mark Faulkner told the commission the measures were needed to limit the spread of the virus and preserve the health care system's capacity to treat patients. He said more testing can be done to get a true handle on the problem.

""We've walked into a dark room with small flashlight, and we've said, we've had one (positive test),"" Faulkner said. ""When we turn on the lights, we're going to see we have a lot more than one. We don't have the ability to turn on the lights right now.""

When originally opting to keep the beaches open, Bender said the county was following guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

However, Grant Bridges, a Pensacola Beach lifeguard, said that on Casino Beach, especially around the pier, people have not been adhering to the guidelines to stay in groups of 10 or less and are ignoring lifeguards' instructions to disperse.

""We have groups of 30, 40, 50 high schoolers going there every day,"" Bridges said. ""We have Navy guys going behind, too, and wrestling and getting intoxicated. These are the facts. Really what concerns me is Casino Beach. That's where we have the most rescues. That's where we have the most people go.""

Bridges added he and his two sisters, who also are lifeguards, are worried that they'll rescue someone who is infected with the coronavirus and bring it back to their family and older parents.

""I'm seriously concerned that if we keep these beaches open, continuing this crisis, people like me, lifeguards like me will put their families at risk,"" Bridges said.

Ultimately, after hours of discussion, the entire commission decided to shut down the county's beaches for the next two weeks. Bender said he hopes projections about how the virus will impact the health care system are wrong.

""This is a huge economic impact, but lives do matter more,"" Bender said. ""We can come back from economic impacts. So when we do get some direction or requests from our health care professionals, it becomes difficult for me to look them in the face and either tell them I can't do that, or they don't know what they're talking about.""

With its vote Friday, Escambia County became the last county in Northwest Florida to order its beaches closed. Santa Rosa County on Friday morning ordered Navarre Beach to close, a day after officials said at a press conference that the beach would stay open.

Beaches at Okaloosa and Walton counties, as well as public beaches in Destin, have also closed. Panama City Beach leaders voted Friday to close the city’s nine miles of beaches starting at 7 p.m. Friday through Thursday — at which point the council will reconvene and determine if the closure should be extended.

Under the terms of the Panama City Beach emergency ordinance, police will have discretion in how to enforce the closure, such as blocking the beach access points. Failure to comply with the closure could result in a $500 fine or up to 30 days in jail

Beaches to the west of Pensacola across the state line have also closed after Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey ordered their closure.

Joining the federal and state governments, the commission voted and approved the declaration of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic at a special called meeting on Tues.

During the meeting, the Escambia County commission and other elected county officials considered the closure. “First thing is to recognize this is unchartered territory. This is a challenge that is facing the county, the state, the country—well it’s the world, and in our lifetimes we have not had this type of outbreak of a virus to deal with. No one really knows exactly what the best thing to do is, but the best thing you can do is err on the side of precaution,” said County Administrator Tony Sanks. Sanks explained that the closure is simply out of precaution; as of right now there are no confirmed cases in the county.

The preventative measure is to ensure the health and safety of all residents and employees. The decision did not come without thorough consideration. Consulting with every head of office in the courthouse before and during the meeting, the commission considered the benefits to closing now in an effort to slow the spread of the virus.

“This virus does not pay attention to state and county lines. It is easily transmittable and it is something we really need to pay attention to,” said Sanks.

Meeting with other county commissioners throughout the state on Mon., Chairman Karean Reynolds shared an update from the Association of County Commissions of Alabama.

“We had an Alabama Association County Commission meeting yesterday. The Gov. gave a report from our task force on this particular topic. The CDC website had 36 confirmed cases this afternoon in the state. Throughout the state of Ala. 40% of our hospital beds are being used. The CDC recommended that you do not engage in social gatherings of 20, the President took it to 10,” said Reynolds.

With these facts in hand, Reynolds and the commission reached out to elected officials for guidance in the matter.

“I want to thank our elected officials for working on this with us. Thank you for giving of your time to help us make this difficult decision,” said Reynolds.

Addressing the room about the rapidly changing climate surrounding the virus, Sanks explained the great need for social distancing. “Today, the surgeon general said that we have the same number of cases today as Italy did two weeks ago. If we don’t take big measures now, in two weeks where will we be? I think it is important to make every effort you can to reduce contact with the public and with our employees.”

Following the recommendations by elected officials, the CDC, state and federal governments, the commission deemed it in the best interest of the citizens of Escambia County to close the courthouse and declare a state of emergency.

With this declaration the following will go into effect:

Escambia County facilities shall be closed to the public through April 5, 2020. The Chairman, Vice Chairman, and County Administrator are hereby authorized to execute the necessary contracts, agreements, and other documents necessary for the continuity of government under the provisions of the Code of Alabama , §31-9-10(b). The Sheriff’s Office, County Jail, Emergency Management, County Commission & Administration, ECATS, Agency on Aging and Road Department & Engineering are departments providing essential services to the public or support services and shall continue to operate. All employees will continue to be paid during the time that the county facilities are closed.

During the closure, the court system of Ala. will remain open; however, all in-person trials have been suspended until next month. Residents will still be able to contact local officials. Contact information will be posted on the door of the courthouse. The contact information is listed below for all individuals needing assistance during the closure.

Alabama,Etowah,43907,https://www.gadsdentimes.com/news/20200317/etowah-county-local-cities-declare-state-of-emergency-over-covid-19,"Etowah County, local cities declare state of emergency over COVID-19","The Etowah County Commission on Tuesday declared a local state of health emergency for the county in response to the spread of the COVID-19, a novel coronavirus that has in recent days seen cases confirmed in Alabama.

Despite no results showing the pandemic has been detected in Etowah County as of Tuesday, a resolution passed by the commission states that the health emergency has or will imminently threaten the county.

A number of local municipalities also issued emergency proclamations in support of the county’s declaration.

The county’s resolution allows the commission to “waive procedure and formalities otherwise required by law pertaining to the performance of public work, entering into contracts, the incurring of obligations, the employment of temporary workers and the purchase and distribution with or without compensation of supplies, materials and facilities, and the appropriation and expenditure of public funds.”

The resolution was passed in an effort to limit the number of meetings needed during the emergency while still giving the county the authority to continue to conduct business.

Through the resolution, commissioners could discuss matters without reaching a physical quorum, including via phone or video conferencing. Commissioners could not vote on actions without a quorum, but action could be taken in an emergency without a vote.

Commissioners approved the resolution during a regular meeting after discussing the ongoing coronavirus situation during a work session held beforehand.

Local municipalities including Gadsden, Rainbow City, Attalla and Glencoe passed resolutions declaring local emergencies on Tuesday. Hokes Bluff was expected to pass a similar resolution during a meeting later Tuesday evening. Southside’s City Council is not expected to meet until next week.

The proclamations from the municipalities offered support to the county, while also acknowledging that extra steps could be taken to ensure that essential services could continue within each city during the emergency.

The declarations stem from Section 31 of the Alabama Code, which lays out emergency management organizations and the powers of local governments during an emergency.

Under the law, municipalities and local governments are able to prepare for emergencies by developing emergency management plans, providing rescue teams and other emergency management workers, establishing control centers to serve as command posts during an emergency and more.

During an emergency, though, the municipality or county can waive some procedures pertaining to the performance of public work to react quickly in times of need. They also are authorized to close any and all public buildings under their control or impose a public safety curfew.

Many municipalities have already begun closing city halls, public libraries and other facilities in response to the coronavirus in an effort to impede its spreading, and the county has postponed some court hearings while working to ensure that the courthouse could remain open to the public for matters that require coming to the courthouse.

Still, commissioners and Chief Administrative Officer Shane Ellison urged the public to utilize online services for driver’s license renewals, car tag renewals, mobile home renewals, recordings and property tax information, amongst other available services.

They also discussed restricting entrance to the courthouse to the ADA-compliant entrances on the south and west sides of the building, where hand sanitizer or hand washing stations will be available. The courthouse also plans to ask those who enter who show signs of illness to leave the facility.

After declaring the state of emergency, the commission agreed to plan not to meet until its next scheduled public meeting on April 7. Should action be required before then, an emergency meeting likely would be called.",state_of_emergency,103931

After 5 p.m. today, all Jefferson County non-essential retail stores are mandated to shut down to try and slow the spread of COVID-19 in the most sweeping of any such regulation in any Alabama county. As of Monday morning, Jefferson County accounted for 79 of Alabama’s 167 coronavirus cases.

Law enforcement officers will begin to patrol shops and businesses in the state’s most populated county, first to ensure compliance and secondly to make sure criminals aren’t taking advantage of an already-stressful situation.

“I’m having the cars on each beat to make sure that everyone is aware the law does apply to them,’’ said Bessemer Police Chief Mike Roper. “We are not trying to arrest anyone. It’s very important that they do it. And it needs to be volunteer. It’s for their safety and the public’s safety.”

Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall on Saturday sent a memo to all law enforcement in Alabama informing them of how they can legally enforce the health order. Marshall said those who knowingly and willing violate the Alabama Department of Public Health’s orders during the coronavirus pandemic could face misdemeanor charges and fines of up to $500.

“While the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the government’s evolving response seem to demand some restraint related to criminal enforcement of this order, if a violator has been made aware of the health order and the refusal to comply presents a threat to public health and safety, the penalties of Section 22-2-14 are available as an enforcement tool,” Marshall wrote in the memo.

Alabama law says “any person who knowingly violates or fails or refuses to obey or comply with any rule or regulation adopted and promulgated by the State Board of Health of this state shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” The law also says if a person continues to violate or not comply with the order, they can be charged with an additional offense daily.

On Thursday, State Health Officer Scott Harris, issued this order:

Prohibited gatherings of 25 or more where people cannot stay 6-feet away from each other.

Closed all beaches, senior citizen centers, colleges and universities.

Childcare centers except those providing care for the children of essential workers

Prohibited visitation at hospitals and senior living centers.

Prohibited on-premise dining and consumption at all restaurants and breweries. Only take-out or curbside pickup is permitted.

Elective dental procedures postponed.

Jefferson County Health Officer Mark Wilson issued a stricter order and ordered all nonessential businesses closed, even expanding the list of mandated closures on Sunday night to include all hair salons, barber shops and retail stores.

“This is a matter of life and death,’’ Wilson said in a video statement announcing the expanded restrictions and saying his earlier announcements left confusion. “I’m aware that many people are asking questions about what is essential or not. This is not a time to look for loopholes.”

Jefferson County law enforcement leaders say they are aware of Marshall’s memo and plan to keep an eye on compliance.

“At this point, we are advising citizens and businesses of the various Health Department notices and violations because everything is too new and fluid. We are referring them to the updated information and asking them to comply,’’ said Birmingham Police Chief Patrick Smith. “Repeated violations may result in further action by the Health Department, referral of businesses for business license review to the Public Safety Committee or enforcement of the misdemeanor sections.”

“It is not our goal to over police the conditions, but we do want people to take this seriously - and I do believe many have - and voluntarily comply to keep everyone safe and reduce the transmission of the virus,’’ he said.

“I would encourage the community to adhere to the Health Department’s restrictions and guidelines to keep children and families safe, by keeping them home as much as possible to limit exposure,’’ Smith said. “If you have to call the police for any reason, alert the dispatcher, if you or someone in your home has been diagnosed with Covid-19 or showing symptoms, so that we are able to respond appropriately to limit any exposure.”

Jefferson County Sheriff’s Deputy Chief David Agee said he is expecting 100 percent compliance.

“Our enforcement efforts haven’t changed – our objective is to catch criminals,’’ he said. “But if we get a complaint, we will respond to it. We will advise them they are in violation and give them a chance to comply. I think that’s the best way to handle it.”

In Mountain Brook, Police Chief Ted Cook said the Chamber of Commerce is making sure all affected businesses know about the order. “We’d much rather educate than have to issue violations,’’ he said. “Most of our businesses do everything they can to follow the law. I wouldn’t anticipate any violations.”

Hoover Police Chief Nick Derzis said his department received complaints over the weekend about some businesses that remained open despite the restrictions. “We went by and talked to them and most didn’t know they were supposed to be closed,’’ he said.

Department leaders are meeting about the issue Monday. A challenge in Hoover, Derzis said, is that part of the city is in Jefferson County and part is in Shelby County, which is not under as many mandatory closures. “We’ll abide by whatever the Health Department puts out there and we’re hoping the businesses will adhere to whatever rules and regulations are issued.”

Homewood Sgt. John Carr said they, too, met today about the matter and how best to handle the situation, including issuing daily citations ranging from $25 to $500. ""We will be enforcing it,'' he said.",deaths,659479

“Testing continues to be a concern for us,” said state health officer Dr. Scott Harris, speaking at a press conference in Montgomery on Monday. “One of our continuing problems is locating specimen collection kits.”

Harris said every state in the nation is on the hunt for the critical testing supplies, which include swabs, viral transport media and transport tubes used to secure the samples for transport to labs.

The testing supplies are scarce in testing sites throughout Alabama, and it’s a problem shared by many other states.

“As you know, the states have been told that we are on our own in terms of finding this equipment, and so everyone is competing with each other, trying to find sources that can provide those materials,” Harris said.

President Donald Trump in a press conference last week told reporters that the federal government is not a “shipping clerk” and in a March 16 press conference said governors can get the critical supplies and masks faster by “getting them on their own.”

Eric Blank, chief program officer at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told The New York Times on Friday that there are “acute, serious shortages across the board” for supplies needed to do tests.

Labs across the country are scaling back the numbers of tests being done to preserve supplies for those whom health care providers think are most likely to experience severe complications or death from the virus.

As of Monday afternoon, the state’s lab in Montgomery had conducted 1,832 tests, and 196 were confirmed COVID-19 cases across 24 counties, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health’s statistics.

Commercial labs are not required to report negative tests to the state, so it’s unclear how many tests those labs have conducted. The lab conducting testing last week at Church of the Highlands in Birmingham said they’ve performed more than a thousand tests.



Alabama’s struggle to get the needed swabs and testing supplies also continues to limit the number of test sites across Alabama, Harris said.

There are 17 such testing sites connected to the State Department of Health and the Alabama Hospital Association, but there could be more if the needed supplies arrive, he said.

“We hope to have 25 sites fully functional by the end of the week,” Harris said.

Because testing supplies are low, Harris said the state is looking to only test those who have symptoms and are either hospitalized, have weakened immune systems or other health conditions, who are over the age of 65, are healthcare workers in a long-term health care facilities “and other types of patients can be considered on a case by case basis.”

“Generally speaking, we only want those symptomatic patients that meet these high-risk criteria,” Harris said.

People who don’t meet those criteria may still be able to be tested through commercial labs with a physician’s referral, Harris said, “but we’re trying very hard to preserve our testing capacity for those people who most need it.”

The lack of confirmed cases in some counties, and low case count in others, is likely due to less access to testing in those places, Harris said.

The state is trying to overcome barriers to testing in underserved areas, especially in rural spots, but said “there’s still a shortfall that exists there.”",school_business_closure,659479

ST. CLAIR COUNTY — The St. Clair County Commission declared a State of Local Emergency on Monday in response to the growing threat of the coronavirus.

St. Clair County Commission Chair Paul Manning signed the authorization as the coronavirus could impact the health, safety and economy of the people of the county.

The declaration allows the county to waive procedures and formalities typically needed. This includes:

Performance of public work and taking whatever prudent action is necessary to ensure health, safety and welfare of the community.

Entering into contracts.

Incurring obligations.

Employment of temporary workers.

Utilization of volunteer workings.

Rental equipment.

Acquisition and distribution, with or without compensation, of supplies, materials and facilities.

Appropriation of expenditure of public funds.

This precedes Jefferson County banning gatherings of 25 or more people. In addition, nursing homes will now ban visitors, restaurants, bars and brewers will be pickup or delivery only for one week. Starting Thursday, all private schools will be closed until April 6.

As of Monday afternoon, there were 29 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Alabama. Seventeen of those confirmed cases were in Jefferson County. There are still no deaths associated with the outbreak in the state.

Earlier in the day, the Alabama Department of Public Health urged people to avoid gatherings of more than 50 people, unless they can maintain a 6-foot distance between others, to limit spread of the coronavirus outbreak.

The advice follows guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, State Health Officer Scott Harris said.

Harris said restaurants are urged to keep a 6-foot (2-meter) distance between tables and limit admittance to 50% of capacity. Harris said people attending weddings and funerals should also try to maintain 6-foot (2-meter) distance. He said workplaces may not be able to maintain the distances but should try whenever possible.

Senior citizens, and those with health problems, should be more careful, Harris said. Senior adults or those with chronic health problems should avoid gatherings, outside of close family, of 10 or more people, and should avoid travel by air, train or bus, the state health department said.

“I think if we all cooperate, if we all manage to do this then we will have a little bit of time where we are inconvenienced and uncomfortable but I know we will come out OK on the other side,” Harris said.

For most people, coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. People with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover, according to the World Health Organization.",state_of_emergency,86308

Apache Junction declared a state of emergency on Friday after announcing temporary closures of its library and other city facilities earlier in the week to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.

“We don’t want anyone to be alarmed,” Mayor Jeff Serdy said in a written release. “This just allows the city to access funds if there are federal funds that are allocated.”

Apache Junction is a community of more than 40,000 residents that crosses over from Maricopa County into Pinal County.

""We want to protect our citizens and visitors during this serious situation, and this is the most prudent way to address it at this time,"" Serdy said.

Serdy encouraged residents to follow CDC recommendations to avoid large groups and stay home.

What's closed and open in Apache Junction

The library is closed, but residents can continue to use online services.

The Apache Junction Multi-Generational Center closed indefinitely, and all city classes and fitness programs have been suspended through the end of the month.

The city has temporarily suspended senior programs, including in-person dining, at the multi-generational center. Meals will be supplied to seniors on a drive-thru basis and by delivery.

City-run special events are suspended through the end of March.

Refunds of registration fees or facility reservations and membership suspensions will be offered as requested.

The Apache Junction Water District issued a temporary moratorium on water service disconnections during the pandemic. It encourages residents who can make a payment to do so online, by mail or at one of the city's dropbox locations.

Other city operations, including the City Clerk's Office and Development Services Department, remain open.

City crews will increase their cleaning schedule for public buildings and sanitize high-touch areas.

The move follows Governor Doug Ducey’s declaration of a statewide public health emergency, and directions issued from the Chief Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court.



Effective March 17, the following measures will be in place:

All in-person proceedings shall be avoided to the greatest extent possible, consistent with core constitutional rights.

Through March 31, all hearings which would not result in the violation of a specific codified time limitation will be rescheduled, unless otherwise ordered by the judge assigned to a particular case under extraordinary circumstances.

For all in-custody defendants, every hearing set forth in Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 1.5(c)(1), will be conducted by an interactive audiovisual system, unless otherwise ordered by the judge assigned to a particular case under extraordinary circumstances.

The attendance of persons, other than court officials, at all court proceedings in Cochise County is limited to parties, attorneys, victims, witnesses, jurors, one parent of a juvenile defendant, and jail personnel, until further order of Presiding Judge James L. Conlogue.

“I urge citizens to remain calm,” she said.

At the same time, she declared a state of emergency in the county, mostly, as she explained, to free up access to federal and state funds in the event they are needed.

“The good news is we have no positive reports [of coronavirus] in Mohave County,” Bishop said.

It is a fair assumption, though, that the virus is already in the community, County’s Public Health Director Denise Burley said. She advised the public to visit the Public Health Department’s website (https://bit.ly/2x95T8a) and Facebook for daily updates.

As of March 18, the county had conducted 12 tests with no positive results reported, said county Public Health Nursing Services Manager Lynne Valentine.

“Our testing capability is limited, as it is throughout the state,” Burley said.

There are no immediate plans to arrange mass testing sites, she continued. To be tested, one must still demonstrate both symptoms and exposure, like a recent travel or a contact with a coronavirus carrier. If someone in the county would test positive, their whole family would be asked to stay home, Burley said.

Mohave County Emergency Coordinator Mike Browning said elements of a county Emergency Operation Center have already activated and the county is prepared to move to full-scale operation, if needed.

Friday, March 20, will bring another important meeting, Bishop said. The county will be deciding on further closures, such as libraries or less essential departments. The future of local small businesses, and employees in the county who have already lost their jobs, will be discussed.

Workers are particularly affected in Laughlin, Nevada, and Bullhead City, after casinos and businesses in Clark County, Nevada closed after that county reported its first coronavirus death.

“We’re doing everything possible to address the crisis,” Supervisor Gary Watson of District 1 said. “We’ll get through this. Remain calm and faithful to your government. … Use common sense.”",state_of_emergency,203030
Arizona,Navajo,43911.73264,https://ktar.com/story/3036685/navajo-nation-orders-residents-to-shelter-in-place-as-coronavirus-spreads/,Navajo Nation orders residents to shelter in place as coronavirus spreads,"PHOENIX — The Navajo Nation expanded the stay-at-home order it put in place to combat the coronavirus spread on Friday night.

The same day the Navajo Nation Health Command Operations Center issued a shelter-in-place order for the community of Chilchinbeto in Arizona, they also issued a public health emergency for the entire nation.

“We are getting many reports of people still being out in public and putting elders and everyone at risk. This is a very serious situation and if need be, we will take steps to enforce the ‘Stay at Home Order’ even more,” Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said in a press release. “The more people go out in public, the greater the risk is for a massive health crisis on the Navajo Nation.”

The nation is requiring all residents stay home and isolated, with all non-essential businesses closed down to prevent the further spread of COVID-19. The order also outlines provisions for “essential activities, essential businesses, and any work necessary to the operations and maintenance of essential infrastructure.”

The decision comes after the Navajo Nation reported an increase in the total number of positive coronavirus cases to 14 on Thursday, an increase of 11 from the previous day. Chilchenbeto, a community of 500 people, had seven cases of COVID-19.

The other seven cases were in the Chinle, Arizona, and Shiprock, New Mexico, areas. Only three of the Navajo Nation cases were reflected in Arizona’s official count of 63 cases as of Friday.

Navajo County in Arizona reported 10 cases on Saturday morning and 104 cases were reported across the state, according to the Arizona Health Department Services.

“While there are a higher number of people receiving negative COVID-19 test results for the virus at this point, there are many tests that are awaiting results and confirmation,” Nez said in the release. “The purpose of the closure is to allow the Navajo Nation as a whole to isolate and quarantine.”

Most of Navajo Nation’s territory is in Arizona, but it spans across the Utah and New Mexico borders.

The nation’s shutdown is the latest around the state after Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey issued restrictions for counties across the state with positive coronavirus cases.

On Thursday afternoon, Ducey ordered restaurants in counties with confirmed COVID-19 cases to provide takeout options only, while gyms, movie theaters and bars in those areas shut down at close of business on Friday.

The shelter-in-place order could be hard to enforce for communities like Chilchinbeto, however, because the rural community has no local services and residents must leave town to buy supplies.

Yuma County issues declaration of emergency on COVID-19.

Yuma County has officially issued a declaration of emergency over COVID-19. Yuma County Supervisor Board Chairman Tony Reyes says board members approved the declaration this morning. Reyes says the Board’s decision was made as a proactive reaction to a serious public health threat.

""We’re trying to get ahead of this to be able to assure the public that the county and the department, the health department of the county, and every employee of the county is ready to take care of our residents, of our public,"" Reyes said Friday. ""And we want to make sure, if need be, and actions need to be taken that are drastic, we’ll be able to do that.""

Diana Gomez, director of the Yuma County Public Health Services District, assured the public that even though an emergency declaration has been made, there is no reason for anyone to panic.

""As of this moment, and it’s a rapidly evolving situation, there is no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Yuma County,"" Gomez said. ""When we become aware of a confirmed case we will notify the public.""

Gomez added that at this time there are also no “presumed cases” of COVID-19. She said a presumed case is when someone is believed to be showing symptoms of the virus, but test results have not yet confirmed it.

Gomez says that as testing becomes readily available, more cases will be discovered. She says that does not mean there is more disease in the county, but rather that more people infected are being discovered.

Officials reiterated that the best thing people can do to protect themselves is to wash their hands often and stay away from situations where they can be exposed.

Arkansas,Cleveland,43908,http://www.clevelandcountyherald.com/2020/03/18/governer-orders-school-closures/,Governer Orders School Closures – Cleveland County Herald,"RISON – Both the Cleveland County and Woodlawn School Districts closed their schools this week by order of Gov. Asa Hutchinson to help curb the spread of the COVID 19 coronavirus in Arkansas.

In a press conference Sunday, Hutchinson announced that he was ordering all public schools across the state to suspend on-site instruction beginning either Monday, March 16, or Tuesday, March 17, and for the schools to remain closed until Monday, March 30, at which time the state will assess the situation.

Hutchinson said he gave the two-day option since some school districts could use Monday to distribute AMI (alternative means of instruction) packets to students. AMI is a set of lessons that students can complete at home to avoid having to make up that day at the end of the school year.

Since the week of March 23-27 was already set aside for spring break, Hutchinson’s decision to close schools this week will make for two consecutive weeks that students will not be congregated together at school.

Cleveland County Superintendent Craig Dupuy and Woodlawn Superintendent Dudley Hume both announced Sunday afternoon after the press conference that they would be suspending on-site instruction on Monday, March 16.

The governor’s decision comes after announcing in a press conference last week that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) had recommended against broad closure of schools.

After hearing feedback on that policy from parents and school personnel after that announcement, Hutchinson said Sunday he decided to change course.

“But as we continue to look at the guidance from the CDC, where they do not recommend the broad closure of schools, it is also important to listen to the parents and educators who do not have a level of confidence in terms of their safety and what the situation with COVID 19 in their community,” Hutchinson said.

During a separate press conference Monday, Hutchinson said the CDC’s guidelines is to close schools three to four days only if a student at that school tests positive for a disease. He said the CDC advises that those school use the three-to-four day closure to thoroughly clean and sanitize the buildings.

Arkansas Department of Education Secretary Johnny Key said the state will be working directly with superintendents during the closure to see that all buildings are cleaned and disinfected during the two-week period.

“We think this is prudent at this time to make this call, and I appreciate the governor’s leadership on this,” Key said during Sunday’s news conference. “This is a very tough call to make because we know that students depend on so many things for their care and education in their local schools.”

Both Dupuy and Hume said they will be cleaning and sanitizing their buildings immediately.

Here is an overview of what each school district is planning during the closure:

Cleveland County

Dupuy told the Cleveland County School Board during its regular monthly meeting Monday night that he was requiring all teachers to be logged in to their school email accounts from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. each day this week to assist students with their work or answer questions. He said they will not be required to be online next week since that will be Spring Break.

As for cleaning the buildings, Dupuy said the custodial staff started scrubbing the doors, walls, floors, etc. of each building on Monday. Once that is completed, he said they will then use a mister to sanitize the buildings and no one will be allowed inside after that until March 30.

Woodlawn

Since Woodlawn was previously scheduled to be off this Friday, March 20, before the school closure was ordered, Hume said Woodlawn students will need to complete AMI packets two through five this week. Woodlawn had used AMI packet one earlier this year.

Hume said he was meeting with the school custodial staff Monday morning to begin a thorough cleaning of the buildings on campus. Hume cut off access to the school buildings after 9 a.m. Monday. He said no one will be allowed inside the buildings until March 30, unless directed by the administration.",school_business_closure,8593

""We're going to build us a brand new state-of-the art hospital,"" Sevier County Judge Greg Ray said when the votes were totaled.

The funding for the hospital will be generated from sale of up to $24,250,000 in bonds and a proposal for a 1% sales tax.

Complete, but unofficial, results showed 1,594 votes for the sales tax and 308 against along with 1,594 votes for the bond issue and 299 against. That's 82% in favor of the sales tax and 84% in favor of the bonds. Voter turnout was 29%.

The proposed location for the new county board-operated hospital is about four miles north of De Queen on U.S. Highway 71. Ray said the purchase of the land is already in the works.

Construction could start in spring 2020, Ray said. The feasibility report for the hospital has projected that the new facility will add an estimated 100 jobs to the community, Ray said.

Before the election, Ray was hopeful the issues would pass.

""We have had six town hall meetings and in all of them we got good responses, good feedback,"" he said. ""I felt good about it but I was surprised at how overwhelming the vote was,"" he said.

The town hall meetings were held in all parts of the county. Sevier County also includes the towns of Lockesburg, Horatio and Gillham.

The hospital would be a 12-bed facility, and Nabholz Construction Corporation would be the company hired to build the facility. The maximum amount for the bonds to pay for the hospital is set for $24,250,000, which would cover the costs of land, construction, improvements, parking, utilities, equipment and interest on the bonds,

The De Queen Medical Center stopped taking patients in February 2019 and officially closed in May. Ray and Steve Cole, the county Rural Development Agency chair, have worked since then to open a new hospital in the county.

Public health officials on Sunday announced five new cases of coronavirus in Northern California, including three new cases in Santa Clara County, and two health workers who were likely infected while exposed to a patient in Solano County.

The two Bay Area health care workers are ""presumptive positive"" with COVID-19 coronavirus, the Alameda County Health Department reported on Sunday. A presumptive positive case is a person who tested positive by a public health laboratory and is pending confirmatory testing at the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention.

Both patients are NorthBay VacaValley Hospital health care workers and are currently in isolation at home; one is a Solano County resident, the other is an Alameda County resident, according to health officials. Both also had exposure to the community-acquired case currently hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento. The woman in the initial case is slowly recovering, health officials said, and her family members had negative test results for COVID-19 so far and remain in quarantine.

“In her stay there of several days, there were many health care workers who came into contact with her,"" said Solano County Health Officer Dr. Bela Matyas. ""We were aware of that once we learned about her situation, North Bay hospital and public health officials very aggressively identified everyone who could have possibly had contact with her and then quarantined them.""

Maytas added the ""good news is that the ill health care workers, none of them are ill enough to require hospitalization.""

Public health and hospital staff said they quickly identified all health care workers in contact with the person during his or her hospitalization. All of those health care workers remain in isolation or in quarantine and will not return to patient care until they are cleared, the health department said.

The announcement also brought Santa Clara County’s total to seven cases of the new virus, known officially as novel coronavirus or COVID-19, the Santa Clara County Public Health Department said Sunday evening.

The fifth case involves an adult woman with chronic health conditions who was hospitalized. The sixth and seventh cases involve a husband and wife who recently traveled to Egypt. The husband has chronic health conditions, and the couple is currently hospitalized, according to the department.

“We understand that the evolving news about COVID-19 is concerning, and we are taking the situation very seriously. This news is not unexpected in the Bay Area, and we are ready for cases here. This is not the time to panic; now is the time for all of us to work together."" — Dr. Erica Pan, Health Officer, Alameda County Public Health Department.

A full contact investigation is underway for the two new health care worker cases, and individuals potentially exposed are in the process of being identified and evaluated.

Teams of epidemiologists from the CDC and California Department of Public Health are helping the health departments in tracing those who may be at risk for exposure because of the new cases.

Alameda County and Solano County Public Health Departments are monitoring these new cases’ conditions as well as their contacts for symptoms.

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have experienced mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

Similar to the flu, it appears to cause less severe illness in younger people; those with more severe impacts tend to be older, medically fragile individuals with underlying medical conditions.

“With the discovery of these new cases, we may see additional cases of COVID-19 in the community,” said Dr. Dean Kelaita, Calaveras County Health Officer.

One of the confirmed cases was a child who is currently enrolled at Copperopolis Elementary School.

Mark Twain Union Elementary School District Superintendent Julia Tidball reports the school will be closed until further notice starting Wednesday, March 11 and the district has asked all students, teachers and staff to stay home. All school events have been canceled.

California,Contra Costa,43900.68681,https://patch.com/california/concord-ca/coronavirus-contra-costa-county-updates-health-guidelines,Coronavirus In Contra Costa County: Emergency Declared,"CONTRA COSTA COUNTY, CA — Effective Tuesday and for the next two weeks, Contra Costa County public health officials are recommending that groups cancel large gatherings where 50 or more people are within arm's length of each other, including concerts, sporting events, celebrations, conventions, religious services and other church gatherings.

The new guidelines came as the county's Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency in the county to deal with the potential spread of the new coronavirus, or COVID-19.

As of Tuesday, a total of 10 Contra Costa County residents have tested positive for the new coronavirus. Of those, four were known to have had contact with people who previously tested positive. Six had no recent history of travel outside the United States or known contact with a confirmed case. In addition, three confirmed cases from outside Contra Costa have been treated at hospitals in the county.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading from person-to-person, not only in Contra Costa County. Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others. That is why the U.S. Centers For Disease Control and Prevention recommends that these patients be isolated either in the hospital or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer pose a risk of infecting others.

To slow the spread locally, officials with the county's public health department, Contra Costa Health Services, were scheduled to announce new public guidance in a briefing at 2 p.m. Tuesday. [Officials with CCHS said the briefing would be live-streamed on Contra Costa Health Services' Facebook page at 2 p.m. but it appears the video was delayed; if it becomes available we will share it here.]

The new guidelines are in addition to those released Friday by the county for people 50 and older, as well as people of all ages who suffer from serious illnesses such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, lung disease or immunosuppression. Friday, the at-risk community members were advised to avoid mass gatherings, such as parades, sporting events or concerts.



""CCHS is releasing updated health guidance to protect the community from novel coronavirus (COVID-19),"" CCHS Spokesman Karl Fischer said Tuesday. ""The updated guidance includes specific actions recommended for people at high risk of severe disease, community gatherings, businesses and employers, schools, public transit and the general public.""

Organizers are encouraged to cancel or postpone events for, or attended by, older adults or others who are at higher risk for severe illness. Those considered at higher risk are people 50 or older, as current evidence indicates that the risk of severe illness from the new coronavirus increases with age; and people of any age who have underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or chronic lung diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).

In adopting the emergency proclamation Tuesday, Board of Supervisors Chair Candace Andersen, said: ""The new coronavirus or COVID-19 presents our community with a challenge. While I urge you to be prepared, it is certainly not a time to panic. Following our health officials' guidelines will help prevent the spread of disease. The County and Contra Costa Health Services will continue to offer guidance and resources. Meanwhile, there is much each and everyone one of us can do to keep our families and communities well. It will take all of us working together.""

In voting unanimously in favor of the county emergency proclamation, supervisors said ""everyone plays an important role.""

The proclamation, the board said, will help the health department mobilize county resources, accelerate emergency planning, streamline staffing, coordinate agencies across the county, allow for future reimbursement by the state and federal governments, and raise awareness about how everyone can prepare in the event COVID-19 begins to spread in the community.

""The County and its health department will continue to work with multiple agencies and jurisdictions to keep residents informed during this local emergency,"" County Administrator David Twa said.

City and county officials, including public health, emergency and law enforcement representatives will update the community this afternoon on how Del Norte is handling the COVID-19 pandemic.

Among the topics that will likely be discussed is the concern that people from out of the area are visiting local beaches and other outdoor attractions, Crescent City Mayor Blake Inscore told the Wild Rivers Outpost on Monday.

The news conference will be streamed at 4 p.m. on the Del Norte County and Crescent City YouTube channels.

In a video address to the community, Inscore urged Del Norters to maintain social distancing, staying home except to obtain essential needs such as food, prescriptions and to see their medical providers. He also addressed reports circulating on Facebook and other social media outlets over the weekend regarding people coming into Del Norte County from other areas.

“We’ve seen what other coastal communities have done, especially on the Oregon coast and (we’ll) be discussing that today,” Inscore said in the video. “We are concerned, just as you are, with your safety and the safety of our community as a whole.”

Though he couldn’t say whether Del Norte County or Crescent City will follow the footsteps of many Oregon seaside communities that have asked visitors to leave, Inscore said “we at least need to talk about it.”

Inscore said it’s especially a discussion that should come from the Crescent City Police Department, Del Norte County Sheriff’s Office and possibly even the California Highway Patrol.

“We should be talking about it because people are concerned about it,” he told the Outpost.

In Del Norte County, 35 COVID-19 tests have been administered as of 11:20 a.m. Monday, according to the Public Health Branch. The results for 26 tests have returned negative and nine are pending, according to the Public Health Branch.

Statewide, there are a total of 1,733 positive COVID-19 cases and 27 deaths as of 2 p.m. Sunday, according to the California Department of Public Health.

California Governor Gavin Newsom issued a stay-at-home order Thursday that covers the entire state and will be in place until further notice. Essential services that continue to be open include gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, farmers markets, food banks, convenience stores, take-out and delivery restaurants, banks and laundromats.

Essential state and local government functions, including law enforcement, are also open.

Businesses that are closed include dine-in restaurants, bars and nightclubs, entertainment venues, gyms and fitness studios, convention centers, hair and nail salons, and public events and gatherings.

El Dorado County on Thursday joined dozens of other California counties and cities to declare a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus outbreak, ensuring resources and funding are available to slow the spread of COVID-19.

There were not any confirmed COVID-19 cases in El Dorado County on Thursday afternoon, according to a news release. All COVID-19 tests conducted in the county have been negative.

But officials there say it was appropriate to declare a public health emergency due to confirmed cases in the region and the high likelihood that El Dorado County will have a confirmed case at some point soon.

“It is a prerequisite for requesting and receiving any available federal or state funding and will allow us access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission in El Dorado County,” Dr. Nancy Williams, the county’s public health officer, said in the release.

Within hours of the state’s first reported death due to COVID-19 complications last week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus. Sacramento, Placer and Yolo counties have done the same.

El Dorado County officials said Thursday’s declaration allows them to provide or receive mutual aid from other jurisdictions and helps in open up resources, mutual aid and staffing.

The county continues to work closely with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and California Department of Public Health on coordinated testing, investigations and guidance and help to health care providers. The joint efforts also include monitoring for acute respiratory illness and gathering information to detect new cases for lab testing and confirming infection.

El Dorado public health officials were encouraging local facilities, such as long-term care and nursing facilities that have elderly and frail residents, to create procedures that include limiting and screening visitors, and daily monitoring. They also have been encouraged to consulting with public health officials.

Following guidance from state officials, El Dorado’s Public Health agency was not recommending that local school districts close campuses Thursday, except for postponing or canceling non-essential large gatherings. Officials said the county also was considering limiting non-essential meetings and gatherings, but any specific details will be announced as they are developed.

Williams said the risk of transmission for COVID-19 remains low for the public. But she also said it’s important for people to notify their healthcare provider to determine whether testing is needed if they have respiratory symptoms and have traveled to a country with active COVID-19 within the last 14 days or if they have been in close contact with a person to have lab-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis.

The Fresno County Board of Supervisors declared the novel coronavirus an official emergency Tuesday, following recommendations from federal and state officials, but at least one supervisor said it’s an overreaction.

In two separate votes, the supervisors gave the county’s emergency director and its health officer the power to pursue state and federal emergency funds as they become available.

Officials announced the emergency earlier in the week but Tuesday’s vote during a special meeting made it official. The county began monitoring the virus after it first showed in China, according to David Pomaville, director of the county Public Health Department.

“I think this is going to be with us for a while,” he said. “I assure you every week we’ll see some changes.”

Two Fresno County men have tested positive for the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, officials said on Sunday.

The first was a man older than 65 who had been on a Grand Princess cruise; the second was described as a middle-aged man who had traveled abroad. Both are recovering and have been instructed to self-quarantine, according to county health officials.

Declaring a state of emergency also will give the county flexibility in managing its approximately 7,000 employees, many who have families dealing with school closures, according to Fresno County Administrative Officer Jean Rousseau.

Library shutdown

The county will begin shutting down its libraries due to recommendations to keep gatherings to 10 people or fewer, Rousseau said. Officials are also assessing which employees can work from home and which must interact with the public.

“We still have services to provide,” he said. “We just have to be very careful how we do that.”

Tax season is also ramping up as April approaches. Officials said sending checks in the mail is the safest way to pay taxes for the public and for public employees.

Some industries, like those in the agricultural sector, will continue to operate through the emergency, officials noted. Producing food can’t come to a halt for several weeks, according to Supervisor Brian Pacheco, who is a dairyman.

“We don’t have a choice,” he said. “We have to milk, feed and water the animals every day.”

County officials say they are working with farmers to make sure their work force is being monitored and ensure they are allowed time off, if they need it.

Brandau: Many are alarmist

Though county officials were urging the precautionary measures, Supervisor Steve Brandau said many public officials were being alarmist.

“I think that many in government and in our society have been overreacting to the Chinese coronavirus,” he said. “This overreaction causes me great concern over the economy.”

“I’m very concerned about sending the message that we should be shutting everything down,” he said

He ultimately voted with the rest of the supervisors to declare the emergency, noting it loosens the protocol in case an emergency contract is needed to respond to the outbreak.

City of Fresno

Fresno Mayor Lee Brand declared a state of emergency on Monday in response to the coronavirus and announced a number of measures the city is taking to serve residents during the pandemic.

The Fresno City Council voted unanimously the same day to approve the mayor’s declaration. The council supported a price-gouging ordinance after reports that some markets were selling items at exponentially high rates.

Officials have also thinned out some of the less necessary items from the City Council meeting scheduled this week. No ceremonial matters are scheduled for Thursday’s meeting, for example.

State response

Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday urged all movie theaters and gyms across California to shut down temporarily, and for restaurants to close except for takeout service.

That order escalated the governor’s directive a day earlier, when he said all bars and nightclubs statewide should close and that restaurants should limit their occupancy. He said Californians older than 65 should voluntarily self-isolate at home.

Newsom gave Monday’s executive order hours after President Donald Trump and the White House recommended no gatherings of more than 10 people be held for at least the next 15 days.",state_of_emergency,955272

Although the individual risk for contracting COVID-19 continues to remain low in Lake County, all community members should take the opportunity to plan for the possibility of local cases and the potential for community spread. Clearly, the virus is spreading widely—as of March 8, 2020, there were four hundred twenty-three (423) cases in the United States with nineteen (19) deaths. Outbreaks continue to spread in Africa, Americas, Eastern Mediterranean, Europe, South East Asia and the Western Pacific– and the global impacts are beginning to be felt.

Lake County Public Health is prepared to manage and investigate suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19. Public Health will continue to work closely with federal, state, and local partners to provide the public with accurate information about actions to be taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and to care for those who may become ill with this virus. As with other respiratory infections, there are steps that everyone can take to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

People Can Protect Themselves By:

The best way to prevent the spread of illness, including; seasonal flu, novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and other respiratory illness is to practice everyday illness prevention steps:

Washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing

If soap and water are not readily available, use alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, making sure to rub your hands together until the sanitizer is dry

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash

Avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.

Staying home if you are sick, especially from work, school and public places.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces

Personal Preparation Measures Include:

Gradually stock up extra supplies of important items, such as: soap, hand sanitizer, tissues, over the counter medications and prescription medications.

Gradually stock up on non-perishable foods.

Create a back-up plan for work, school and childcare in the event of closures.

Talk to your workplace about getting ready. Plan for telework, if possible.

Create a space in your home to care for sick family members.

Replace handshakes with elbow-bumps – make a game of this with your kids.

What to Do if You Think You’re Sick:

Previously, all testing was being performed at the CDC laboratory in Atlanta.

Diagnostic testing for Coronavirus is becoming more available with state testing at 19 California Public Health Laboratories including in Sonoma County. Commercial labs like Quest are now offering these tests. Unfortunately, the capacity continues to be limited, so during this transition period, only the highest risk patients are recommended to receive testing. Speak with your medical provider if you have symptoms.

Call Ahead if You Have Symptoms:

If you develop a fever, cough and shortness of breath, and believe you could have COVID-19, notify your healthcare provider by phone. Call ahead so that you can be safely evaluated and prevent exposing others.

Always check with trusted sources for the latest accurate information about novel coronavirus COVID-19 by visiting the following websites:

In Madera County, there is currently one confirmed case of COVID-19 but health officials say declaring an emergency will help better prepare them should more cases arise.

“Things haven’t changed yet in Madera county, we still have one case, there’s no evidence of community spread so for me it’s the time to put everything in place to keep things the way they are and to keep things from going up,” said county health officer Simon Paul.

Officials say school closures have a cascading effect on other government services.

“What that does is provides us with flexibility in the county to allocate resources needed, reassign staff to different roles, as the situation changes in response to COVID-19,” said public health director Sara Bosse.

Though they say the risk hasn’t changed in the past few days, the anxiety has. Madera County Sheriff Jay Varney says disturbance calls are up.

“We saw someone with a pick-up truck in this area had like six cases of toilet paper stacked up in a pick-up truck. I mean you don’t need that for your family you’re either going to scalp that or you’re just scared and there’s no reason to be that concerned yet,” said Sheriff Varney.

Amid social distancing, officials encourage people to check in on family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.

“Ask one another, how are you doing, how are you coping, are there ways we can support and encourage one another,” said Bosse.

Health officials say the one case reported was travel-related and they currently monitoring seven other people.

This legal designation will allow both governments to operate more quickly in nimbly if the situation worsens, but do not reflect the existence of an actual crisis, and as the Mendocino County Sheriff’s Office noted in a tweet, are actions taken “proactively.” Indeed, no cases of COVID-19 have been identified in Mendocino County.

Since both the state and Mendocino County have declared an emergency, government agencies will be able to access additional funds, increases coordination between local, state, and federal government, and allow for federal re-reimbursement of other funds, in order to support local governments and better prepare for the likely spread of the COVID. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra also issued a warning to the public that price gouging due to the coronavirus is illegal and to report any instances to local law enforcement.

The Mendocino County Sheriff and the Interim Public Health Director will be holding a press conference covering local COVID preparedness efforts on Thursday morning at 9 a.m., which will be live-streamed on The Mendocino Voice Facebook page and the county’s Youtube page.

California,Mendocino,43908.02847,https://www.northbaybusinessjournal.com/northbay/napacounty/10831780-181/napa-sonoma-county-coronavirus-orders,"Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake counties pursue 'shelter in place' orders, while Napa Valley bans gatherings","Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake counties pursue 'shelter in place' orders, while Napa Valley bans gatherings

Napa: Bans public private gatherings of 50 or more: Effective 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, March 18 through 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, April 7

With seven other San Francisco Bay Area counties implementing shelter-in-place orders affecting nearly 7 million, Sonoma, Mendocino and Lake counties on Tuesday evening took a similar path to battle the new coronavirus.

Meanwhile, Napa County on Tuesday afternoon said it would seek to bar gatherings of 50 or more people, but Solano County on Tuesday said it would stick with Gov. Newsom's recommendations to slow the virus outbreak.

Mendocino County's public health officer around 8 p.m. Tuesday announced that the area would join the Bay Area joint order as of 10 p.m. Wednesday.

The Lake County public health officer is anticipated to issue shelter-in-place order for that area of the North Bay by Wednesday afternoon or evening, according to a Clearlake Police Department alert on the Nixle system at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday.

Effective midnight at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday in Napa County, public and private gatherings above 50 there are prohibited “in response to the increase scope and severity of COVID-19,” said Napa County Public Health Officer Dr. Karen Relucio.

The order, which extends until April 7, comes as Napa County has yet to log any confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Relucio’s announcement stated the county took the step in light of the spread of cases in areas surrounding the county.

Solano County was an early epicenter in California for COVID-19 cases and community spread of the virus. The county on Tuesday said it had nine confirmed cases.

The county's public health officer, Bela Matyas, M.D., M.P.H., in a YouTube video Tuesday explained his decision not to pursue a shelter-in-place order.

""Sheltering in place is not right terminology to be using for what is really social-distancing orders,"" Matyas said. He said the phrase is used for when residents are instructed not to go outside because the air is dangerous, such as during a toxic chemical spill or fire with smoke.

Matyas said the Bay Area orders mirror the social-distancing directives individually from Newsom and President Trump on Monday. He noted that the list of exceptions for ""essential activities"" in the orders is ""very long, and very little is not excluded from the concept of 'don't go to work.'""

""I think there has been a lot of significant misrepresentation of the content of those orders, and it's unfortunate because it's been accompanied by a lot more panic and concern,"" Matyas said. ""The problem is that people are over-reading the orders - they're overreacting - and it will potentially harm business if people are staying away from work that is essential, that should continue. And it's difficult for the economy to sustain that for any length of time. It will be difficult for people who lose their own income.""

Matyas said it's a misconception that the orders were necessary for workers to qualify for unemployment insurance. Rather, the governor's order was all that was needed, and Newsom also lifted the one-week waiting period for such assistance.

Sonoma County's shelter-in-place order took effect at midnight Wednesday but wasn't issued until Tuesday evening, after top county officials earlier in the day told the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors about such a plan.

Dr. Sundari Mase, the county’s interim public health officer, stopped short of issuing the order during the Board of Supervisors meeting Tuesday.

Sonoma County has documented four cases of community spreading of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19. Two of those people work in health care, including one person who is an employee at the Rohnert Park Health Center, a nonprofit clinic.

“I think moving forward more quickly is probably best at this point. We had four cases in three days, and I fully expect more this week,” Mase told the Press Democrat.

The county has released little to no other information about those four cases, withholding basic, general details under a the banner of patient privacy.

Officials in seven San Francisco Bay Area counties issued a shelter-in-place mandate Monday, affecting nearly 7 million people, including San Francisco itself.

The order says residents must stay inside and venture out only for necessities for three weeks starting Tuesday in a desperate attempt by officials to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

It affects the counties of San Francisco, Marin, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Cruz, as well as the city of Berkeley.

Napa’s order bars public or private gatherings of 50 or more persons “except as necessary to perform essential government functions. “ Public or private gatherings of fewer than 50 persons are permitted in the county “only if hosts or sponsors implement all of the COVID-19 risk mitigation measures.”

Local schools in Merced County began preparations Monday to shut down classes for at least a month amid the growing threat of coronavirus.

Meanwhile, the Merced County Board of Supervisors on Monday formally declared an emergency. As of Monday afternoon, Merced County had no confirmed coronavirus infections. Nearby Stanislaus County, however, has reported three infections.

Merced County Office of Emergency Services and the Department of Public Health first declared a health emergency Friday. The Board of Supervisors held an emergency meeting Monday to officially ratify the plan.

“This declaration wasn’t made lightly,” Supervisor Scott Silveira said about the local public health emergency. “This cuts through the bureaucratic red tape.”

The declaration opens the county to funding, reimbursement and resources, as well as expediting emergency response processes that are typically slowed by local provisions or regulations.

County officials said it is not a matter of if the county gets a confirmed COVID-19 case, but when. They stressed that the situation is evolving rapidly. “These two emergency declarations are preemptive,” Supervisor Lloyd Pareira said. “The emergency hasn’t shown itself in Merced yet.”

County Public Health Director Rebecca Nanyonjo-Kemp said it’s possible someone in Merced County could already have the virus, but without increased laboratory testing capability, the county cannot be sure.

“We have been impacted, as the rest of this state has been, with our laboratory testing capabilities to get a true and accurate portrait of the spread of disease throughout this community,” she said.

Twenty individuals have been tested for coronavirus in Merced County. All came back negative or are still awaiting results. That number does not include commercial labs, which recently gained the ability to test for COVID-19. However, the county would be notified if any tests were positive.

County officials continued to urge people to disseminate accurate information and curb the spread of misinformation, which can cause panic. Official information and resources can be found through the county, the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.

Impact on local schools and parents

On Sunday, Merced County school district superintendents and county education officials held an emergency meeting where they decided to close classes at all 20 local school districts starting Thursday, preschool through 12th grade, with classes expected to resume Monday, April 20.

School officials said they are using Monday through Wednesday to give school districts a chance to plan for drive-thru meal services, which will launch Thursday.

Some parents aren’t waiting until the schools officially close to keep their children at home. For example, unofficial numbers from the Merced Union High School District show that excused absences Monday were up to four and half times higher than normal, according to Sam Yniguez, district spokesperson.

Yniguez said parents who choose to keep their children at home can do so without repercussions. But if it makes more sense for parents to send their child to school before Thursday, that’s OK, too.

“This is one of the reasons why we’re not closing right away,” Yniguez said. “We are giving parents and caregivers time to get their affairs in order before the upcoming school closure which starts Thursday.”

Some parents said the situation is causing added stress.

“It’s definitely a disruption to our schedules, so there is some stress too because we’re not sure how long this will last,” said Dalia Magana, 35, from Merced. The mother of three was picking up her 9-year-old child near Burbank Elementary in Merced on Monday.

Magana said that she relies on child care, but she is able to work from home.

She said local education officials made the right decision in closing the schools.

“It’s safety measures and I think that it’s the right thing to do even though we’ll all have to sacrifice. I think we all have to do our part and be OK with disruptions, be OK with stress because it’s going to keep other people safe.”

David Smythe, a junior at Merced High, also said he understood the need for closures. “But I can see how it’s kind of unfair to seniors, especially this is their last year at this school and it’s kind of being compromised by them closing the school down,” he said.

Nathan Quevedo, spokesperson for Merced County Office of Education, said MCOE received messages from parents about the school closures. Some parents had questions about childcare options and what the closure will mean for parents who work full time.

“We really hope to have more information and more resources available for our communities in the next 24 to 48 hours. I can say that we’re developing a webpage now, mcoe.org/covid19, that will link directly to these resources,” Quevedo said.

Quevedo also said there are plans to have a map on the website with information about school meal preparations, which will most likely be a grab-and-go style, in order to try and limit the social interaction between nutrition services staff and the community.

“We really have to think about there’s still people that will provide vital services in our schools and make sure that they’re safe and that we have the correct protective gear, that we’re not putting them in a dangerous situation, we’re being thoughtful about all of it,” he said.

Quevedo echoed Yniguez sentiments, saying for parents who don’t feel safe sending their children to school, attendance is optional for most districts until Thursday.

“If (children) are exhibiting flu-like symptoms or if they don’t feel good, or if you as a parent just don’t feel safe sending your child to school, we understand,” he said.",state_of_emergency,263228

USA TODAY

Monterey County on Friday declared a local emergency related to the COVID-19 coronavirus — though no cases have been detected in Monterey County.

The move was a precautionary measure taken to activate and coordinate resources, county officials said Friday.

A health event in Gonzales and the Sea Otter Classic at Laguna Seca have also been postponed because of the coronavirus.

""After careful consideration, and although we are not experiencing any active cases of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) in our community, nor in Monterey County, we have decided to take the precautionary measure of postponing the Community Summit that was scheduled for this Saturday, March 7th at Gonzales High School to a future date,"" the city wrote in a letter.

Coronavirus is highly contagious respiratory virus that has infected more than 100,000 across the globe, including 260 in the United States. California has treated 70 people for the disease, according to the New York Times.

On Friday, Gonzales announced it would be pushing back the summit, which was planned to celebrate the city's selection for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Culture of Health Prize from among 200 communities that applied.

The prize honored five communities for ""pursuing innovative ideas and bringing partners together to rally around a shared vision of advancing health, opportunity, and equity,"" according to a prior press release from Gonzales.

The event was supposed to run from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., and Gonzales residents would also receive free T-Mobile hotspots.

FYI: How can Monterey County schools protect kids from the coronavirus?

The Sea Otter Classic, a four-day bicycling festival that draws tens of thousands to Laguna Seca, and the Bicycle Leadership Conference have also been postponed, the Steinbeck Rotary reported Friday. Information on a new date will be posted at www.seaotterclassic.com, possibly by the middle of next week.

They're among the latest events cancelled across the United States because of COVID-19. Austin's SXSW music, film and technology festival was cancelled Friday because of the coronavirus, which is spreading across the world.

In addition, the virus has led to two cruise ships' passengers being quarantined at sea, including the the Grand Princess anchored about 100 miles from Monterey Bay.

The U.S. Coast Guard flew test kits out to the ship Thursday. Of 46 people tested, 21 tested positive, according to USA Today.

Most infected people have mild symptoms, but its fatality rate has bounced between 2% an 3.4%.

That concerns health officials, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because it could easily spread among vulnerable populations.

At least 14 people have died across in the United States and more than 3,200 have died across the world.

Tips to protect yourself and others from coronavirus

This map shows the countries that have reported Coronavirus infections (Photo: PROVIDED/CDC)

The CDC has created a website dedicated to COVID-19.

It says the following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.*

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath

The CDC offers these tips for preventing COVID-19:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.

CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.

Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.

Impact: Salinas Chinese restaurant business dips slightly amid coronavirus outbreak

There is no specific antiviral treatment recommended for COVID-19, according to the CDC. People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. For severe cases, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.

People who think they may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider immediately, the CDC advises.

By midday Monday, public health officials around the Bay Area had confirmed at least 258 cases of the virus, including at least four deaths. The Bay Area accounts for more than half of the confirmed cases across the state.

Seven Bay Area jurisdictions instituted a shelter-in-place order effective Tuesday through at least April 7 in an effort to contain the spread of the new coronavirus. The order applies to residents in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara and Marin counties and the city of Berkeley.

In Napa County, a local public health emergency was declared last week by Napa County's health officer. Although there were no confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus among Napa County residents as of Monday, leadership of all four cities have all now followed suit.



The risk of COVID-19 infection in Napa County appears to be moderate, according to public health officials.



""Health and safety of our community and employees is of utmost importance to all of us,"" Napa City Manager Steve Potter said. ""The responsibility to keep our community safe is taken very seriously by city staff.""



In an abundance of caution and in light of the state's recent direction — asking bars, brewpubs, nightclubs and wineries to close, as well as asking those over age 65 to self-quarantine — the Napa City Manager's Office is working to develop a path forward to respond to the evolving nature of COVID-19, according to a city news release.

Potter declared a local emergency to help local small businesses access funds available from the Small Business Association and other resources, and to provide greater authority to quickly respond to the changing nature of the situation.

The Napa City Council meeting Tuesday was canceled, but a special meeting was held Monday night for ratification of the city of Napa's emergency proclamation.

Likewise on Monday, St. Helena City Manager Mark Prestwich declared a local emergency while also calling for social distancing measures intended to reduce ""the exponential growth rates of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic,"" according to a city news release.

Social distancing is a practice recommended by public health officials to stop or slow down the spread of contagious diseases. It requires the creation of physical space of at least 6 feet among people who may spread certain infectious diseases. Residents are strongly encouraged to practice social distancing in stores, restaurants and public spaces, and to avoid mass gatherings at this time.

St. Helena city residents 65 and older are encouraged to quarantine themselves and shelter at home.

In addition to California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling for the closure of bars, wine bars and brewpubs to help stop the spread of the virus, he also encouraged choosing take-out as a food option and asked restaurants to reduce their occupancy by half to keep people farther away from each other.



""As a city, we are working to balance continuing community services while also following guidance by health professionals to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" St. Helena City Manager Mark Prestwich said. ""Our essential services including police, fire and public works field operations will continue while City Hall and library services transition to this appointment-based approach for safety and social distancing reasons.""

In the city of Calistoga, the March 17 City Council meeting, the March 18 Mayor's Forum, the March 19 Council Goal Setting Workshop, and the March 25 Planning Commission meeting were all canceled.

All Calistoga City buildings are closed to the public with the exception of the police department lobby.



All Calistoga youth, young adult and senior recreation programs are suspended until March 31, including the Calistoga Community Pool and all aquatics programs. As previously reported, all Calistoga schools are closed through April 13. The Calistoga Boys & Girls Club is also closed.

The Calistoga Farmer's Market is closed through March 31.

The grocery store CalMart in Calistoga has instituted a phone-in and order pickup program for seniors and residents with medical conditions who are advised to home-quarantine. Deliveries are also being offered within 1 mile of the store. For information on the preorder program, call 707-942-6271.

In the city of American Canyon, all public meetings, gatherings and recreation programs have been canceled through April 12 — the lone exception being Tuesday's City Council meeting, which residents can watch on the city's YouTube Channel or its Facebook Page.

""Importantly, American Canyon remains open for business, albeit differently than before,"" City Manager Jason Holley said. ""While city facilities such as the treatment plants, Corporation Yard, Aquatic Center and Senior Center are now closed to the public, staff is still working at these locations to deliver services in new and different ways. Please continue to check for updates on our website for the latest information.""

The cities within Napa County are all in close contact with the Napa County Public Health Department, which is in contact with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding the new coronavirus. Napa County is updating its coronavirus webpage with pertinent information about the coronavirus crisis.

NAPA COUNTY (CBS SF) — Health officials on Wednesday announced Napa County is joining the coronavirus shelter-in-place order issued by eight other Bay Area counties beginning at midnight this Friday.

According to Napa County’s Public Health Officer, the “shelter-at-home order” is effective at 12 a.m. on Friday, March 20, and will remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. on April 7 unless otherwise modified.

COMPLETE COVERAGE: CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

The order requires that Napa County residents stay at home unless engaged in the outlined “essential activities” such as receiving medical treatment, or getting groceries or medical supplies as specified by other shelter-in-place orders. Residents are also allowed to go outside to exercise or take care of pets, as long as social distancing rules are followed.

The full order can be found online.

Anyone who sick is advised self-isolate, including to the extent possible, from the others you live with.

Individuals are also allowed to leave their homes to perform jobs necessary to the operation and maintenance of essential infrastructure, utilities, and telecommunication. Law enforcement, first responders, those who work in the news media and emergency and public safety personnel are exempt from the order while performing official duties.

While both Sonoma and Napa counties have had the lowest number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the greater Bay Area — Sonoma County had six patients as of Wednesday morning and Napa County had only two — officials with both counties have opted to join the current shelter-in-place order based on the recommendations of state and federal officials.

On Tuesday, Sonoma County officials announced the shelter-in-place order that went into effect Wednesday morning at 12 a.m.

“One proven way to slow the transmission is to limit interactions among people to the greatest extent practicable,” the announcement read. “By reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, this Order helps preserve critical and limited healthcare capacity in Napa County.”

California,Nevada,,https://yubanet.com/regional/nevada-county-declares-local-health-emergency-to-increase-coronavirus-response-resources/,Nevada County Declares Local Health Emergency to Increase Coronavirus Response Resources,"March 4, 2020 – Nevada County is declaring a local health emergency and local emergency in response to the emerging, rapidly evolving situation and increasing spread of novel coronavirus and COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus. There are no known cases of coronavirus in Nevada County currently.

“Nevada County Public Health has ramped up preparedness activities as we’ve seen COVID-19, the illness caused by the novel coronavirus, spread in California, and diagnosed most recently in Placer County,” said Jill Blake, Nevada County Public Health Director. “These declarations enhance Nevada County’s ability to proactively respond to local needs if or when a confirmed coronavirus case happens in Nevada County.”

The emergency declarations allow the County access to additional resources such as mutual aid, financial reimbursement and increased coordination with state and local partners. The local and health emergencies will be considered for ratification by the Board of Supervisors at their March 10th meeting next week.

“In addition to increasing our resources with emergency declarations, our Emergency Preparedness Program has been reaching out to their health care coalition partners, such as skilled nursing and residential care facilities, daily if not more frequently,” added Jill Blake. “We are making sure our community partners have the most up-to-date information on the coronavirus and are thinking about their Personal Protective Equipment resources and preparedness plans.”

Following the recent death of an elderly adult who contracted coronavirus in Placer County, Nevada County encourages the community to prepare for the possibility of local, sustained community transmission.

“We know that being elderly and having underlying health conditions greatly increases the risk of developing a severe case of COVID-19 and of dying from this illness, whereas healthy, younger populations might only experience mild flu-like symptoms,” continues Jill Blake. “Like Placer, we are encouraging our residents that are healthy and not at a higher risk to reach out to those more vulnerable and help them plan for the possibility of transmission of coronavirus in Nevada County. We are calling on all our community partners, from our in-home care facilities to those who have elderly neighbors, to help slow the spread and think through their own preparedness plans.”

The community can help slow the spread of coronavirus by:

• Washing your hands often for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water.

• Coughing into a tissue or your elbow if a tissue isn’t available.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth especially with unwashed hands.

• Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces. Nevada County Environmental Health has created recommendations for homes with known or suspected coronavirus infections (PDF).

• Keeping your distance from people who are sick, especially if they have a respiratory virus. If you think you are exhibiting symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) and have been exposed to the coronavirus, call your local health care provider. Contacting them in advance will make sure that people can get the care they need without putting others at risk.

Since there are no diagnosed local cases currently in Nevada County, now is a great time to prepare for an actual event. Public Health is asking the community to consider how they might adjust if daily routines are disrupted by an outbreak:

• Can you work from home/remotely?

• What are your transportation plans if public transportation is disrupted?

• If schools are closed, do you have an alternate plan for childcare?

• Do you have enough food, medications and other necessities to sustain you and your family if you needed to stay home?

California,Orange,43887,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-26/orange-county-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus-a-day-after-san-francisco-issues-decree,Orange County declares emergency over coronavirus,"Orange County has declared a local health emergency in response to the novel coronavirus, which has killed thousands globally, officials announced Wednesday.

The move is largely in response to a proposal to move coronavirus patients to a facility in Costa Mesa, which has sparked a bitter court battle, Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Michelle Steel and Vice Chairman Andrew Do said at a news conference. At the center of the dispute is a proposal to use the Fairview Developmental Center as a coronavirus quarantine site, an idea that drew swift and fierce condemnation from city, county, state and federal officials representing the area.

“The county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal government’s decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,” Do said.

He and other officials say the transportation of patients into Orange County does not “preserve the health of our community,” which has a population of more than 3 million.

The city of Costa Mesa requested a temporary restraining order from a federal judge on Friday that blocked possible plans to send the affected individuals to the center.

On Monday, U.S. District Judge Josephine Staton ordered federal and state officials to meet with local officials from the county and Costa Mesa to answer specific questions about how the Fairview center was chosen. According to Steel, the status of the restraining order will be decided on March 2.

“We will do whatever we can do keep Orange County coronavirus-free,” she said.

The declaration of a local emergency and a local health emergency creates a mechanism for officials to ask for mutual aid from county, state and federal partners in the event that resources are exhausted, county health officer Nichole Quick said. The declaration allows Orange County to better leverage resources for staffing and agency coordination.

“It expands our ability to respond in a nimble and flexible way in the future,” county health officer Nichole Quick said.

Quick said Orange County will start testing patients who exhibit flu-like symptoms for coronavirus.

There has not been any outbreak of the coronavirus in the county so far, although one resident has tested positive for the illness. That individual has since fully recovered, health officials said.

Wednesday’s decree follows San Francisco Mayor London Breed’s declaration of an emergency a day earlier on the heels of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s warning that COVID-19 is likely to spread within U.S. communities.

“Ultimately, we expect we will see coronavirus spread in this country,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday. “It’s not so much a question of if, but a question of when.”

“With 60 U.S. cases of coronavirus, we are facing a real-life crisis that must be managed,” Orange County Supervisor Donald P. Wagner said. “I support an emergency declaration, not because I necessarily believe the public is in more danger, but because the federal and state governments refuse to give us enough information to discharge our public health responsibilities. We want to be vigilant in ensuring the county is prepared and has sufficient resources to prevent and combat any possible outbreak of COVID-19.”

Rep. Katie Porter (D-Irvine) reiterated the declaration’s intention to prepare, not panic, the community.

“Coronavirus is a serious and growing threat, and the only way we’ll manage this public health emergency is with collaboration grounded in science,” she said.

San Diego and Santa Clara counties have already issued similar declarations.

Health officials in Orange County confirmed one of the first cases of coronavirus in the state in late January. Another patient tested positive in Los Angeles County. Both had traveled to Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.

On Wednesday, Gov. Gavin Newsom told reporters how the state is addressing coronavirus concerns.

“We’re not just preparing — we’ve been actively participating in addressing this issue for many months, aggressively,” he said. “In fact, there’s no other state in America that’s been more involved in addressing the issue.”

Newsom said he met with Trump administration officials to discuss the coronavirus when he traveled to Washington D.C. earlier this month to attend a National Governors Assn. meeting and the state continues to work closely with the federal government.

“We have had a very good relationship, open lines of communication, two-way conversations,” Newsom said. “We’re developing quite good levels of trust, and continue to work through this dynamic moment. I am proud of also being a Californian, where we’re not turning our backs on people, and that’s not the case in every state in this country.”

The governor said the state has been involved in monitoring and identifying individuals who have been repatriated to the state and other travelers returning to California independently on commercial flights.

“Everyone’s concerned,” Newsom said. “There hasn’t been a day since December that’s gone by where we haven’t demonstrably been engaged, and I think that’s an example of the resolve that we have to meet this moment head on. And so, rather than expressing concern, expressing anxiety, I want to demonstrate resolve to address that concern and anxiety, and I think that’s happening in all levels of government, both the county level, obviously at the state level and I couldn’t be more proud of our folks. But also I’ll say this, there’s no reason for me to say it, unless I believe it: at the federal level as well.”

In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city is taking precautions to monitor the spread of the virus.

“The city of Los Angeles will continue to be proactive and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I commend our city and county response agencies for their hard work to keep us safe. My office is working closely with federal, state and county agencies to monitor the situation,” Garcetti said in a statement to The Times.

The mayor’s office said Los Angeles International Airport is also taking precautions to keep travelers and employees safe, including the use of CDC health screeners at the LAX.

There have been more than 81,000 cases of confirmed coronavirus and more than 2,700 reported deaths, most in mainland China.

The first coronavirus death in California has been confirmed in Placer County, health officials say.

According to the Placer County Public Health Department, the deceased was an elderly adult with underlying health conditions. This person was just diagnosed presumptive positive for the illness on Tuesday, according to the health department.

Original story

Placer County declared a local health emergency after health officials confirmed the second case of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the county after a patient who recently traveled on cruise ship tested presumptively positive.

According to Placer County officials, the patient is an older adult who likely was exposed to the novel coronavirus while they were traveling on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico. It was the same cruise ship that a Sonoma County COVID-19 patient was on before contracting the virus.

The patient is critically ill and is isolated from other patients at the local hospital, county officials said.

RELATED: First case of coronavirus confirmed in Placer County

Placer County Public Health Officer Aimee Sisson told ABC10 in a phone interview that healthcare workers are quarantined after being exposed to the second confirmed coronavirus patient.

""We expect to see additional cases in coming days, including cases of community spread, not linked to ravel,"" Sisson said in a press release. ""We are declaring these emergencies today so we will be able to activate and deploy resources to adequately respond to an increase in cases.""

Placer County officials confirmed the first case of the coronavirus on Monday. The patient is a NorthBay VacaValley Hospital health care worker who had previously been exposed to another coronavirus case in Solano County.

Health officials said the health care worker is currently in isolation and showing mild symptoms. All those who had close contact with the patient will be quarantined and monitored.

According to the CDC, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a family of viruses that is spreadable from person to person. Coronavirus is believed to have been first detected in a seafood market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. If someone is sick with coronavirus, the symptoms they may show include mild to severe respiratory illness, cough, and difficulty breathing.

Currently, there is no vaccine. However, the CDC suggests the following precautions, along with any other respiratory illness:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Wash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.

The CDC also says facemasks should only be used by people who show symptoms of the virus. If you're not sick, you do not have to wear a facemask. The CDC says the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low.

California,Placer,,https://www.sacbee.com/news/coronavirus/article241352006.html,Coronavirus update: Placer County directs residents ‘stay home’,"Placer County issued a directive for residents to stay at home except to engage in “essential activities” Thursday, amid a growing effort by counties across the region to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The directive, effective at midnight, stops short of being a formal order, which other counties including Sacramento and those in the Bay Area have issued and carry the force of law. It applies to all cities and unincorporated areas within Placer County.

Under the directive, residents are directed to only leave their house to perform essential activities, such as obtaining medication, getting groceries, performing work to provide essential services or products, or engaging in outdoor activities so long as there’s six feet of space between people.

“It is critical that every member of our community heed this directive if we hope to slow the spread of this disease and prevent severe loss of life,” county health officer Aimee Sisson said in a statement.

“This is an extraordinary measure but we are in an extraordinary time, and we must act quickly to meet this moment.”

Additional action “is a possibility in the future,” said county spokeswoman Katie Combs-Prichard.

“As we receive reports of significant noncompliance, we will provide education and direction,” she said in an email.

Placer County has confirmed a total of nine cases of the novel coronavirus, including one death, as of Thursday afternoon. That is an increase of one case from Monday’s official count.

Placer County had previously offered “guidance” for residents to stay home as much as possible to limit the spread of the virus, which has killed 16 people in California so far.

The county has trailed behind other counties in releasing stricter rules for residents to curb the spread of coronavirus in California.

Bay Area counties ordered residents to “shelter in place” on Monday. Yolo County issued a similar order on Wednesday.

Earlier on Thursday morning, Sacramento County issued a formal order for residents to stay home unless going out for essential chores or services.

Sacramento County officials said on Thursday that the intention is not to cite or arrest anyone, but to have the ability to require bars to close and restaurants to only serve take-out of delivery food.

“As we continually learn more about COVID-19, how easily it is transmitted and how dangerous it can be for some portions of our populations at higher risk, it’s become clear how crucial it is for us to limit interpersonal interactions now,” Sisson said in a statement.

The list of “essential activities” listed by Placer County include:

▪ Maintaining the health and safety of oneself and their family or household members (including pets). This includes, but is not limited to, obtaining medical supplies or medication, visiting a health care professional, or obtaining supplies needed to work from home.

▪ Obtaining necessary services or supplies for oneself and their family or household members, or delivering those services or supplies to others. This includes, but is not limited to, obtaining canned food, dry goods, fresh fruits and vegetables, pet supplies, fresh meats, fish, and poultry, other house hold consumer products, and products necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and essential operation of residences.

▪ Engaging in outdoor activity, such as walking, hiking, or running, provided six feet of spacing is maintained between people who are not members of the same household.

▪ Performing work providing essential products and services at an Essential Business or to otherwise carry out activities specifically permitted in this Directive, including Minimum Basic Operations.

▪ Caring for a family member or pet in another household.

Some essential businesses listed by the county include grocery stores, healthcare facilities, agricultural production and processing companies, banks, gas stations and laundromats.",shelter_in_place,367309

A Declaration of Local Health Emergency was signed by Plumas County’s Public Health Officer Mark Satterfield on March 16 and ratified March 17 by the Plumas County Board of Supervisors. This declaration will allow the county to access necessary resources and staffing to appropriately respond to the threat of COVID-19. It will also provide the county with the ability to access state and federal resources.

The supervisors approved two resolutions during their regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday, March 17, adding Plumas to the list of counties in California declaring a local emergency county. A four-fifths vote was required of supervisors to pass both resolutions.

Supervisors, acting on the advice of County Council Craig Settlemire, accepted the two resolution proposals under urgency items on the agenda. Settlemire agreed that the resolutions were too late to post on the regular agenda and could not wait until the April 7 meeting.

Also, under Gov. Gavin Newsom’s emergency plan temporarily amending parts of the Brown Act, supervisors Kevin Goss and Sherrie Thrall attended the meeting by conference call.

In a report to supervisors, County Administrator Gabriel Hydrick discussed ways supervisors can allow telecommunications for county employees. It will return for possible action April 7. If approved, this would allow some county employees to work from home.

(KTXL) — Sacramento County declared a public health emergency Thursday due to the novel coronavirus.

Officials say the local emergency declaration will allow the county to receive outside mutual aid and request federal or state funding.

“Our intent in proclaiming a state of emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19 is to ensure uninterrupted access to the resources necessary to keep people as safe as possible and lessen disease transmission,” said Phil Serna, chairman of the County Board of Supervisors. “The proclamation should not be considered a reason for elevated concern; in fact, it is quite the opposite as it helps us in our mission to contain the virus.”

As of Thursday, there have been four confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county, according to Sacramento County Public Health officials. That number includes one person who is from somewhere outside of the county or state but is being treated in Sacramento County.

One person in Sacramento County has recovered from COVID-19.

UC Davis Medical Center has also reported all 89 employees who came in contact with a COVID-19 patient are doing well and will be able to return to work. Results from those who were tested came back negative, according to UC Davis Health.

Health officials say that case was the first known instance of COVID-19 community transmission in the country.

The patient, who is from Solano County, was initially hospitalized at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville. One of the hospital’s health care workers has since tested positive for the virus after coming in contact with the patient.

The order carries the force of law. Earlier this week, County Health Director Peter Beilenson announced the same restrictions, but issued them in the form of a directive, which did not have the force of law. A violation of the order can be treated as a misdemeanor crime. Yolo County issued the same order on Wednesday.

Beilenson and other county leaders said the intent is not to cite or arrest anyone, but to have the ability to require bars to close and restaurants to only serve take-out of delivery food.

Beilenson and Sacramento County Board Chairman Phil Serna were joined by Sheriff Scott Jones and District Attorney Ann Schubert in announcing the order, which will go into effect at the end of the day Thursday.

“As of March 19, 2020, at 11:59 p.m., the Sacramento County Health Officer is directing all individuals living in the county to stay at their place of residence except for essential activities,” officials said in a statement. “The legal order is based on the same directives of social distancing issued this week to slow the transmission of the disease, but it provides more detail and enforcement ability.

“To slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, the legal order limits activity, travel and business functions to only the most essential needs and is intended to protect those most vulnerable to the disease, and preserve local healthcare capacity.”

The order includes all incorporated cities — Sacramento city, Elk Grove, Folsom, Rancho Cordova, Citrus Heights, Galt and Isleton — and unincorporated areas including Arden Arcade, Carmichael, Fair Oaks, Foothill Farms, North Highlands, Antelope, La Riviera, Gold River, Vineyard, Elverta, Rio Linda, Orangevale, Mather, Rancho Murieta, Walnut Grove, Wilton and the Delta areas east of the Sacramento River.

“If there’s anybody who’s flippant about this, that is unacceptable,” said Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg. “If you’re flippant about this you are putting yourself, your loved ones, and many people at risk of serious illness or death.”

The order will be in effect until April 7 unless county officials announce a shortening or lengthening of the order. Gov. Gavin Newsom in a Wednesday evening video update said the next two months are a critical period for slowing the rising curve of the coronavirus spread.

“Today’s ‘Stay At Home’ order concludes a deliberative thought process that considers both the public’s critical role in slowing virus transmission and that emphasizes Sacramento County’s function as the steward of public health protection,” said Sacramento Supervisor Phil Serna. He added, “Today’s order reasonably balances a dire need to limit the spread of COVID-19 with great respect for everyone’s civil liberties, and our community’s continuing reliance on essential activities.”

Sheriff and DA on enforcement, arrests

Schubert in particular stressed the urgency of the moment and the need for people to take this order – and the virus threat – seriously, but not to panic.

“It is everyone’s moral responsibility to act today, not tomorrow or next week,” she said. “Time isn’t the main thing. Time is the only thing right now.”

She pointed out that the law “allows harsher penalties” in urgency moments, but said, “we don’t want to have anybody arrested during this crisis. We do not want to prosecute anybody.”

Sheriff Jones said he was representing the county department and police chiefs in cities in the county. “Neither the sheriff nor any of the police (departments) have any desire to make any arrest. We view our role as more of education.”

Her said local law enforcement agencies have full staffing and will respond to the public as they normally do, but may ask virus-related “screening” questions when called to a residence or incident site.

The Sacramento Police Department later echoed Jones’ comments. “A violation of this order could result in criminal or administrative penalties,” the police said in a public statement. “It is important to know that the Sacramento Police Department’s primary goal is to gain willing compliance through education.”

More infections, another death

As of Wednesday, 45 people in Sacramento County have tested positive for coronavirus – up from 40 on Tuesday –and three people have died. County officials said the third death was a person over age 70 with existing underlying health issues. All three deaths in the county have been older people with compromised health condition prior to contracting the virus, Beilenson said. County officials have declined to offer details about individual infection cases.

However, the number of infected people in the county, state and nationally is likely considerably higher than published numbers because the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 tested cases has been so limited so far, Beilenson said.

Sacramento now joins most greater Bay Area counties, including, Contra Costa, Alameda, Solano, Yolo, Napa, San Mateo and Santa Clara in taking the legal step.

The unprecedented step goes beyond the restrictions Newsom laid out on Sunday. Newsom as well called for people not to congregate and for bars, restaurants, gyms and other group places to close, but couched that as a request, not an order.

San Francisco Mayor London Breed was the first on Monday to turn the request into an order in her county, simultaneously with five other bay counties.

Critical time in fight against COVID-19

Federal, state and local authorities, and officials with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are uniformly calling the moment a critical juncture of the United States to attempt to slow the spread of the virus so that the country’s already strained healthcare system does not become overwhelmed with series cases.

Newsom on Wednesday night reiterated that concern, and said the state is working quickly to bring two hospitals online to deal with the crisis, one in the north state, one in the south, and is in talks with the federal government to get a hospital ship stationed off the coast of California.

Hospital officials are clearing space for an expected increase, potentially dramatic, in patient loads.

Sacramento officials said they initially did not want to alarm residents by issuing a full “stay at home” order, and chose instead on Tuesday to make it a strong recommendation. The gravity of the moment and the desire to align with other Northern California counties precipitated today’s decision to step up to a full order.

County officials in Yolo and Bay Area counties reiterated they do not intend to arrest or cite people, unless they run into an egregious situation where residents or businesses are refusing to cease their activities.

Sacramento officials are expected to explain where they stand on police and sheriff involvement during a morning press conference.

The new order though does allow officials to enlist law enforcement officers to proactively educate people about the rules and tell institutions, such as bars, that they must close.

Residents can still go to work, if their supervisors say they are needed at the workplace. The county is asking, though, that all non-essential workers be told to go home and work from home instead.

“The intent of this Order is to ensure that the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to the maximum extent feasible, while enabling essential services to continue, to slow the spread of COVID-19 to the maximum extent possible.”

The order allows people to leave their house to go for walks, exercise, and do go to open businesses, including grocery stores, banks, laundromats, hardware stores, health care facilities, pharmacies, pet food stores, and a few other businesses that are essential to basic household functioning.

In public, though, the order is for people to remain six feet apart. Grocery stores have been given the OK to limit the number of people in the store at one time to assure that people in the store can remain six feet apart, including in the checkout line.

Close businesses, conduct social distancing

The order states that while non-essential businesses must be closed to the public, business owners and supervisors are allowed to be on site to conduct “minimum basic operations.”

County residents are allowed to have visitors in their homes, though health chief Beilenson said that should involve no more than six people, and only people who are healthy, and should include social distancing of at least six feet during those gatherings.

The order states that “all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a household or living unit are prohibited, except for the limited purposes as expressly permitted. “

Bingo halls and card rooms are on the list of events that are required to close. Essential businesses that can remain open include but are not limited to grocery stores, healthcare facilities, agricultural production and processing companies, banks, gas stations and laundromats, among others.

Serna said the order represents a logical step as officials both understand the pandemic and deal with it.

“Each successive day for the past two weeks, local jurisdictions across Northern California have issued additional guidance and direction to limit the spread of COVID-19. Sacramento County has been no different,” Serna said. “With today’s announcement, we have in place a well-planned enforceable ‘order,’ and this latest step represents the conclusion of several sequential actions that have deliberately slowed virus transmission to date, and that will continue doing so well into the future.”

The county issued a list of essential activities, as follows:

▪ Engaging in activities or perform tasks essential to health and safety, or to the health and safety of their family or household members, such as, obtaining medical supplies or medication, visiting a health care professional, or obtaining supplies they need to work from home.

▪ Obtaining necessary services or supplies for themselves and their family or household members, or to deliver those services or supplies to others, such as food and other grocery and cleaning products.

▪ Engaging in outdoor activity, provided the individuals comply with Social Distancing Requirements as defined in this Section, such as walking, hiking, biking, running or equestrian activities.

▪ Performing work to provide essential products and services at essential businesses and government entities as well other nonprofit organizations.

▪ Caring for a family member or pet in another household.

▪ Attending private gatherings of not more than six non-relatives in a home or place of residence.",shelter_in_place,1462131

— San Bernardino Tuesday ordered the cancellation of all gatherings, regardless of size, within the county starting Wednesday through at least April 6. The county also announced its third confirmed case of coronavirus

The order also requires the closure of all movie theaters, gyms, health clubs, bars, adult entertainment establishments and other businesses that serve alcohol but not food.

Establishments serving food and beverage were told to follow guidelines issued by the California Department of Public Health — meaning restaurants could only serve food for delivery or take-out.

The order does not apply to essential activities such as work, public transportation, airport travel, grocery stores, charitable food distribution, certified farmers’ markets and shopping at stores or malls, the county said. Nor does the order apply to congregate living situations.

All schools in the county have already voluntarily closed in an effort to prevent further spread of coronavirus, the county superintendent of schools said.

“I understand this creates hardships for many families and businesses. But at the end of the day I believe we all understand that we are in this together, and that together, we will get through this,” Board of Supervisors Chairman Curt Hagman, who announced the order today in a video, said. “The county is taking every step we can to stay in front of this threat.”

In a statement, San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors Chair Curt Hagman said the order was issued in an effort to protect the public from any possible spread of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.

The cancellation order applies to, but is not limited to, concerts and conferences, as well as professional, college and school sporting events.

""The County realizes that this order will result in inconveniences to many people and businesses,"" Hagman said in the statement. ""However, the County's primary concern is the health and well being of its residents and visitors.""

County spokesperson David Wert told the Daily Press the cancellation order applies to events from elementary through high school.

The order does not apply, however, to attendance at regular school classes, work or services that ""are essential to the functioning of our state and must continue,"" the order states.

As such, the order also does not apply to ""essential public transportation, airport travel or shopping at a store or mall,"" the statement said. In addition, ""congregate living situations, including dormitories and homeless encampments"" are exempt from the order.

Thursday’s order was in line with Wednesday’s guidance from the California Department of Public Health, which marked the first time the state has issued a request for all residents across the state to adopt so-called ""social distancing"" measures, the Associated Press reported.

Although Gov. Newsom declared a state of emergency to help California prepare for broader spread of COVID-19, the health risk to the general public in San Bernardino County remains low at this time, according to the statement.

While no confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the county, numerous cases have been confirmed in neighboring counties.

Large gatherings that attract travelers and other people who don't normally congregate with each other increase the risk of COVID-19 appearing locally, the county statement said.

As of 7 a.m. Thursday, there are a total of 198 positive cases and four deaths in California, according to the state DPH.

Of those, 24 cases are from repatriation flights. The other 174 confirmed cases include 60 that are travel related, 43 due to person-to-person transmission, 44 are community acquired and 27 are from unknown sources. Of all the confirmed positive cases.

The majority of California cases (113) involve people between the ages of 18 and 64.

Thursday’s order follows the county public health officer and the Board of Supervisors’ declaration of a local health emergency on Tuesday.

The declaration was made to help ensure county government and the public are prepared for the possibility of the new coronavirus, or the COVID-19 disease, appearing locally, according to the county.

The county health agency continues to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health to respond to reports of COVID-19.

Parks and recreation officers also confirmed that Fiesta Island was closed after large groups were seen there.

The city of San Diego later tweeted saying gatherings of any size are now prohibited at beaches and parks. Parking lots at all city-run beaches and parks are now closed.

Officers began closing beach parking lots at around 12:30 p.m. when dense crowds were seen on local beaches, said Officer Dino Delimitros of the San Diego Police Department.

“Public health officials are clear that gatherings of any size can lead to the spread of COVID-19, which is why they continue to be prohibited everywhere, including at beaches and parks,” San Diego Fire-Rescue Chief Colin Stowell said. “Local and state rules limiting groups have been in effect for days, so this should not be a surprise to anyone.”

“People can still go for a walk or run or bike ride, but they should do it while following physical distancing rules,” said San Diego Lifeguard Division Chief James Gartland. “The Stay At Home order makes clear that this is not a time for parties, it’s a time to protect the public health.”

The closures and prohibiting of groups are not in effect for other cities in San Diego County. In the city of Carlsbad, News 8 found packed beaches and parks despite warnings.

City and county officials have echoed the instructions of California Governor Gavin Newsom who announced the stay at home/shelter in place order Thursday. Cases of coronavirus/COVID-19 have grown across the state prompting the governor to take an aggressive stance and order residents to only leave their homes for essential needs.

Outdoor activities are allowed under the order, but everyone should adhere to social distancing requirements of at least six feet and limit gatherings to 10 or less.

Supervising public information officer Jose Ysea with the City of San Diego issued the following statement Saturday about outdoor activities and the need for social distancing in public places:

“The State of California has issued a Stay-at-Home order due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This requires Californians to stay at home with certain exceptions, including caregiving, getting necessary health care, purchasing groceries and working to support an essential industry. San Diegans are still able to participate in outdoor activities such as walking, jogging and biking, as long as they follow the social distancing requirement of at least six feet and gatherings of no more than 10 people. Limiting exposure is the best action to take to stop the spread of COVID-19.”

NEWS 8 joined forces with The San Diego Foundation to raise IMMEDIATE, EMERGENCY FUNDS for our most vulnerable neighbors in need. Here is how you can help.

BACKGROUND:

According to the CDC, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a family of viruses that is spreadable from person to person. Coronavirus is believed to have been first detected in a seafood market in Wuhan, China in December 2019. If someone is sick with coronavirus, the symptoms they may show include mild to severe respiratory illness, cough, and difficulty breathing.

Currently, there is no vaccine, however, the CDC suggests the following precautions, along with any other respiratory illness:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Wash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.

The CDC also says facemasks should only be used by people who show symptoms of the virus. If you’re not sick, you do not have to wear a facemask.",shelter_in_place,3211252
California,San Joaquin,43907,https://www.recordnet.com/news/20200317/san-joaquin-county-declares-emergency-over-coronavirus,San Joaquin County declares emergency over coronavirus,"Number of confirmed cases of coronavirus now at 13.

STOCKTON San Joaquin County declared a local emergency Tuesday morning related to COVID-19, the new coronavirus, which has infected 13 county residents to date. It’s a step beyond the local health emergency previously declared that will allow the county to provide additional support to Public Health Services and other agencies seeking assistance.

""It does potentially provide additional sources of funding for expenses that have been incurred,"" said Office of Emergency Services Director Marcia Cunningham, explaining that it puts the mechanism in place to account financially for the costs the agencies experience as a result of dealing with the virus.

That in turn will allow the county to seek reimbursements through state and federal channels.

Cunningham declared the local emergency at 9:41 a.m. Tuesday during a special meeting of the county Board of Supervisors. The board has seven days to ratify the declaration, which they are expected to do at their regularly scheduled meeting next week.

Cunningham told supervisors that five of the county’s seven cities Lathrop, Lodi, Manteca, Stockton and Tracy had previously declared local emergencies in their jurisdictions.

The county has implemented the Multi Agency Coordination group, also known as MAC, to bring all the cities and the county together Wednesday ""to discuss a common approach"" to the current crisis.

Above all, Cunningham said, ""We all need to remain calm."" She also emphasized the importance of each individual taking care of themselves, washing hands, keeping areas clean and avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.

During Tuesday’s special meeting, the board conducted business with no members of the public in the audience. While they weren’t banned from the chamber, the public was ""strongly encouraged"" to stay away and watch the meeting live online.

About a dozen public comments came in by email during the meeting that were read aloud by the board clerk and responded to by supervisors and county officials.

Complying with what is becoming the new normal, seating behind the dais was arranged to allow supervisors, the board clerk and the county administrator to sit 6 feet apart. County Counsel Mark Myles, who usually sits behind the dais, sat alone at the staff table in front of the supervisors.

In the single vote the board took on Tuesday, they unanimously ratified interim Health Officer Dr. Maggie Park’s earlier declaration of a local health emergency throughout the county.

Park told supervisors what is known about the 13 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the county: there have been no deaths as a result of the virus; all the patients are adults (no children have tested positive); three are travel-related; two are from household contact, also referred to as person-to-person spread; and two are community spread. She did not know the source of the other six cases.

County Public Health has moved from a containment strategy tracking all possible exposures to the virus and quarantining people to a mitigation strategy.

""Due to the increased volume of cases, and the fact that we now know we have community spread, we have moved into the mitigation phase which is basically telling people if you have flu-like symptoms to stay home and self-isolate,"" Park said.

""Once you have community transmission, we longer actually issue those quarantine orders because we have other work to do as far as continuing surveillance and messaging and providing guidance. So it is all self-monitoring at this point,"" she said.

Concern about the county’s inventory of critical supplies needed to deal with the virus was addressed by Emergency Medical Services Director Dan Burch, who said that a cache of personal protective equipment (protective gowns, face shields) and respirators have been dispersed to ""community partners"" including hospitals and pre-hospital agencies including fire departments and ambulance companies.

""We were able to immediately offer that assistance to those entities so they could ramp up their own supply chain issues. We are continuing to process those requests to assist but now we have to send those requests to the state and access the state cache,"" Burch said, noting it is a slower process.

Large health care providers such as Kaiser Permanente, Dignity Health (St. Joseph’s Medical Center) and American Medical Response (AMR ambulance) have their own supply chains that are still working, according to Burch

The EMS agency has also planned for and stocked up on hospital beds that can be deployed to the county’s seven acute-care hospitals based upon a study of available ""surge space"" at each hospital, such as conference rooms and hallways, should the need arise.

Supervisors were also told that the Office of Emergency Services has activated its Joint Information Center, bringing together public information officers and representatives from 32 agencies countywide in order to provide consistent messaging to the public.

The primary sources of information recommended were two county websites: SJReady.org and SJCPHS.org. Information and assistance is also available by calling 2-1-1 or (209) 468-3411. Residents who believe they have symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, cough or difficulty breathing — should call their health care provider first.

With the new order issued by the county health officer restricting hospital visitation, supervisors called upon San Joaquin General Hospital CEO David Culberson to discuss activities at the county-run public hospital in French Camp.

Culberson explained that more telemedicine consultations are being conducting each day in an effort to limit face-to-face contacts between providers and patients.

""We are substantially ramping back visits. It was up to half as many on Monday,"" he said.

And while there have been some staff exposures to patients with the virus he did not say how many half tested negative and the other half are still pending test results.

Since last week, Culberson has met every afternoon with the hospital’s infection control practitioner, medical staff leadership, ancillary support and nursing teams to analyze current patients or those who have come through that have been tested or may need to be tested.

Training has been implemented as more is learned about the virus. Every morning, Culberson said, a current inventory of supplies such as face masks and gowns is conducted in light of some shortages over the past few weeks, but what has helped is that San Joaquin County is a Northern California distribution hub for many critical medical supplies.

And while the hospital has upgraded its ventilators, required by patients with critical symptoms, it has retained its older ventilators that can be used as demand increases.

""On Monday, we established a drive-thru clinic. It is by appointment only. We have to have a virtual visit on a telephone first with a provider before we can make an appointment. We saw 25 patients (Monday) and I’m told demand is pretty high today,"" Culberson said.

He made it clear that the hospital drive-thru clinic operating between 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. is not for asymptomatic patients. They first must consult with a doctor before being referred for testing.

Park discussed the county’s current testing capacity, noting the Public Health lab is only able to process 60 tests per day. That is changing however, as more private clinical laboratories are coming on line to process the tests for the coronavirus.

California,Santa Barbara,,https://www.noozhawk.com/article/santa_barbara_county_declares_public_health_emergency_for_coronavirus,Santa Barbara County Declares Public Health Emergency for Coronavirus,"Santa Barbara County officials declared a public health emergency Thursday evening as they continued to monitor for signs that the deadly novel coronavirus had made its way to the area.

Thus far, no cases of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, have been found locally, according to Van Do-Reynoso, the county’s public health director, who spoke at a press briefing at the County Administration Building in Santa Barbara.

Six people have been tested and cleared — five on the South Coast and one in the North County — and nine others currently are in home quarantine and are being monitored by Public Health personnel, said Paige Batson, the county's deputy director for community health.

In addition to declaring a public health emergency, the county has issued a health officer order calling for all gatherings of 250 people or more to be postponed or canceled.

Beyond that, officials are calling for “social distancing” in most other settings — including directing people to stay at least six feet apart in smaller gatherings.

That order will be in effect until March 30, when it will be reviewed.

Meanwhile, the county has set up a public information line for the coronavirus: 833-688-5551.

It will be open until 10 p.m. Thursday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, and probably over the weekend.

As of Thursday evening, Public Health personnel have monitored 61 people, Batson said.

""All have been cleared,"" Batson said.

Seventeen labs in California are conducting coronavirus testing, including in San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties, according to Batson.

""While testing has been expanded,"" Batson said, ""it's important for everyone to know there is still certain criteria that needs to be met for persons to be tested, because we have to prioritize those that are at greater risks of having adverse outcomes.""

COVID-19 testing is ""not necessarily going to be offered or provided upon request,"" Batson said.

Second District county Supervisor Gregg Hart said local government ""is doing everything we can to prepare for and respond to the coronavirus...This is the time we must all act in the best interest of our community and work together to contain this virus.""

The guidelines to be implemented are in alignment with the California Department of Public Health’s most recent guidelines issued Thursday regarding social distancing and public gatherings.

""Even though we have zero cases in Santa Barbara County,"" Do-Reynoso said, ""we are taking these two actions because of the declaration recently by the World Health Organization that COVID-19 is a pandemic, and also because of the recent California Department of Public Health issuance of recommendations on social distancing.

""The health officer order provides firm perimeters for canceling or postponing group gatherings that are nonessential, professional, social and community gatherings. Mandating social distancing is timely, and a proven strategy in prior pandemics.""

Dr. Henning Ansorg, the county's public health officer, said, ""It's ""essential that we implement social distancing as it's the most effective way to slow the spread of disease.

""To protect public health and slow the rate of transmission of the coronavirus in our area, we are implementing measures that are proven to be very effective during previous epidemics and pandemics, and delaying the rate of infection and reducing illness and death.""

Gatherings of people ""who are at the highest risk of severe illness"" of COVID-19 ""need to be limited to no more than 10 people,"" Ansorg said.

Jan Koegler, manager of the county Public Health Department’s emergency preparedness program, said Public Health personnel are communicating with local skilled-nursing facilities and assisted-living providers.

""These are facilities that serve some of our most vulnerable residents,"" Koegler said. ""Many of them have already implemented restrictions on visitors and restrictions on activities for their residents to prevent the spread of disease.""

Public Health personnel also are working with senior service providers and the Area Agency On Aging to coordinate information to keep seniors living independently safe, as well as ensure senior meals continue ""even though some of the senior activity centers will limit their activities now due to the need to provide social distancing,"" Koegler said.

She added that county environmental health service staff are working on procedures and guidance for restaurants ""so they can continue to operate given the instructions for groups and for staying six feet distance from each other.""

County officials hope to have details on Friday, Koegler said.

The county also issued a local proclamation of emergency, said Kelly Hubbard, director of the Office of Emergency Management.

""The local proclamation gives us the opportunity to coordinate with our community partners and the Public Health Department, and utilize our resources available,"" Hubbard said.

Also Thursday night, in a hastily called meeting, the Solvang City Council unanimously adopted measures related to the public health concern, adopting the county public health order, authorizing staff to pull the Solvang Century bike ride permit for routes through the city, and directing staff to work with local businesses to mitigate the economic impact.

The city’s motion also authorized the mayor to send a letter to state and federal representatives seeking financial assistance.

Council members had expressed concerns about the impact on its small businesses and city funding, which heavily relies on tourist spending.

“The fact that all these go into effect until March 30 to me is extremely optimistic, and I sure hope this is the case because this could be huge,” Councilman Robert Clarke said.

California,Santa Cruz,43906.80139,https://patch.com/california/santacruz/coronavirus-shelter-place-issued-santa-cruz-county,Coronavirus: Shelter In Place Order Issued For Santa Cruz County,"SANTA CRUZ COUNTY, CA — Santa Cruz County has issued a shelter in place order from Tuesday, March 17 to Tuesday, April 7 in hopes to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. Residents are ordered to go in public only for essential activities such as getting groceries, health care, child care and medications.

Nine cases of the virus have been confirmed in Santa Cruz County as of Monday. The county is considered to have community spread, since public health officials are unsure of how some patients became infected.

The news came hours after six counties in the immediate Bay Area announced a similar order.

Santa Cruz County said in a statement that it is permissible for people to leave the house for facilities related to the following activities defined as essential: law and safety; essential government services; health care; pharmacies; child care; farming; groceries; food retailers; telecommunications; reduced capacity restaurants; hotels; social services; establishments; agencies that service the needy; gas stations; banks; laundry businesses; safety and sanitation businesses.

(See the full list in the order embedded below.)



The county said it is working to create contingency plans to protect vulnerable and needy residents, and ensure their needs are met.

Soon after the shelter in place order, the Santa Cruz Police Department notified the public that its front lobby would be closed until further notice.

Two weeks ago Santa Cruz County issued a Local Health Emergency for the new coronavirus due to concerns about its spread in neighboring counties and a need to prepare for a potential outbreak.

Anyone with concerns about their health should contact their doctor or call 211 to find a local clinic. The county encourages the public to visit santacruzhealth.org/coronavirus for local updates and links to important CDC updates.

Gov. Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency to provide additional resources, prevent price gouging and help the state better prepare for the virus's spread.

The emergency declaration followed the first known coronavirus-related death in California — an elderly Placer County resident who was exposed to the virus on a Grand Princess cruise Feb. 11-21 from San Francisco to Mexico and back.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that include the common cold as well as much more serious diseases. The strain that emerged in China in late 2019, now called COVID-19, is related to others that have caused serious outbreaks in recent years, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was on Jan. 21.

The disease, which apparently originated in animals, is now transferring from person to person, although the mechanism is not yet fully understood. Its symptoms include fever, coughing and shortness of breath, and many patients develop pneumonia. There is as yet no vaccine against COVID-19 it and no antiviral treatment.

According to the CDC, the best way of preventing the disease is to avoid close contact with people who are sick, to avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands, to wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, and to use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol if soap and water are not available.

To avoid spreading any respiratory illness, the CDC recommends staying at home when you are sick, covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and throwing the tissue in the trash, cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Sheriff Eric Magrini said he had been reluctant to declare a local emergency because he did not want to elevate the level of fear. But the declaration will help local officials qualify for state and federal funding to help prevent the spread of the virus, he said.

""It's been something where I've not been wanting to cry wolf,"" Magrini said.

There was one case in the county where a man in his 50s tested positive earlier this month, but the man is no longer showing symptoms and he has since tested negative for the virus, he said.

""However, considering the severity of the outbreak in other parts of California and the United States, we are taking this step to maximize our ongoing response efforts to this serious and evolving situation,"" county Health Officer Karen Ramstrom said.

""The local health emergency will allow for an efficient and swift response by waiving administrative barrriers and regulations and allowing us to access state and federal resources to support this response,"" she said.

The announcement was made during a brief news conference where Ramstrom and Magrini were joined by other officials from the county and the cities of Redding, Anderson and Shasta Lake.

The Redding City Council is expected to make a similar announcement for the city during a meeting Tuesday night.

Ramstrom said the last time a local emergency was declared was during the 2018 Carr Fire, which burned 229,651 acres in Shasta and Trinity counties, destroyed 1,614 buildings and killed eight people.

Declaring a local emergency won't mean law enforcement will be enforcing a ban on large gatherings or sending deputies out to make sure bars are closed, Magrini sai.

""We live in a responsible community, and I don't foresee taking that kind of enforcement action,"" he said. ""This isn't any kind of martial law.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom and President Trump have already declared emergencies for California and the nation, respectively. Newsom has called for canceling or postponing any gatherings of more than 250 people.

On Sunday, Newsom took the unprecedented step of calling for all bars, wineries, nightclubs and brewpubs to close statewide.

He also urged seniors and people with chronic health conditions to isolate themselves at home in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus.

The state also will reduce occupancy in restaurants by half to keep people farther away from each other, Newsom said.

“We require social distancing in these establishments,"" the governor said, using the phrase that's become part of everyday conversation about keeping away from other people to prevent the spread of the illness.

In the North State, many entertainment venues, including the Redding Civic Center and Cascade Theatre, have postponed numerous shows and events. One of Redding's largest annual events, Kool April Nites, has also been called off.

Most school districts in the county have canceled classes until after spring break next month. Movie theaters in Redding have also closed their doors.

Magrini said that in the current climate, he had been reluctant to declare the local emergency because he did not want to elevate the level of fear in the community.

But he said declaring a local emergency would enable county officials to qualify for state and federal assistance.

A novel coronavirus was identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China in 2019. The illness caused by the virus has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). CDC

Sierra College on Monday declared a state of emergency and is limiting who can access its campuses, according to officials.

Hours later the University of California at Berkeley announced it would be suspending most in-person classes, starting Tuesday.

Sierra College officials are limiting access to the system’s s four campuses for the month of March.. Only registered students, faculty, staff and affiliates are authorized on the campuses, according to the college’s website.

“This declaration also allows us to take actions outlined by the California Department of Public Health and distributed by the California Community College Chancellor’s Office to provide instruction remotely and support continuity of instruction,” read the statement.

Instruction will continue for the college’s 20,000 students. But by Wednesday, faculty should be prepared to provide instruction remotely, including labs and other activities. The college district will determine which labs will remain on site.

By March 18, all campuses are expected to be online under a campus learning system called Canvas.

Instructional field trips, travel for classes, all community events held on campus and student club events are canceled for March.

All athletic competitions are still scheduled but without spectators. Travel and away games are continuing for now, according to the district’s statement.

The four-campus college serves students at locations in Rocklin, Roseville, Grass Valley and Truckee.

The college district stated it took action after two Sierra College employees were exposed to the coronavirus. Both employees returned to work at the Rocklin campus administrative office after they were exposed, and were sent home once they were notified of the exposure. No one associated with Sierra College has tested positive for the virus, according to officials

Los Rios Community College District, which operates Cosumnes River College, American River, Folsom Lake and Sacramento City, has not yet made a decision similar to Sierra College. Los Rios officials are in the process of planning multiple scenarios including converting all classes to online.

Classes at UC Berkeley will be offered online until the end of March, according to the university’s announcement Monday afternoon. All large campus-sponsored events will be canceled or postponed.

The patient did not travel to China, or have contact with anyone who did.

""At this point we don't know where the patient was exposed,"" said Dr. Bela Matyas, Public Health Officer for Solano County, speaking at a news briefing Thursday afternoon.

The unidentified woman is hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.

She was transferred there from Northbay VacaValley Hospital when her conditioned worsened.

At both facilities, she came into contact with medical staff, and potentially infected numerous people.

""We have identified exposure to dozens of employees on our health team but it still remains less than one hundred,"" said Steve Huddleston of Northbay Healthcare.

Those employees, along with the woman's family and colleagues, are now in home quarantine or even more stringent isolation conditions, and are checked on several times daily.

""We make sure their needs are met, and they aren't developing signs or symptoms of the disease so there is an ongoing active surveillance of that group of people,"" said Matyas.

Officials won't disclose where in Solano County the woman lives, but say she has no connection to Travis Air Force Base or the Americans evacuated from China and quarantined there.

A federal whistleblower has claimed government workers sent to assist at airbases were not well equipped, trained or protected, and traveled freely off-base.

Solano officials defend the protocols at Travis.

""I have never worked with a more meticulous group of people, they were scary meticulous,"" said Matyas.

What is needed- all agreed- is a wider criteria for who should be tested, but there are obstacles.

Early symptoms resemble a common cold or respiratory infection, and test kits have not made it into mass production.

""We're still dealing with a test that is limited in availability so we have to prioritize by risk and we're not going to prioritize maybe's over likely's,"" said Matyas.

Medical professionals, including those at U.C. Davis Medical, have been frustrated that the test is not performed readily, as they requested with the female patient.

CDC defended the delay.

""There were multiple people involved over four days to make that decision, it wasn't necessarily CDC,"" said Dr. Christoper Braden of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

By declaring a local State of Emergency, Solano County hopes to prevent outbreak in high risk settings where people have close contact. Already, local schools are disinfecting shared surfaces, in anticipation of continued Coronavirus spread.

""We picked up on it, and it may also be in other communities and they don't know it,"" said Braden, ""but we're going to see community transmission in the United States.""

Their best hope, officials say, is to buy time to develop a vaccine and improve treatment.

""We know the cat is out of the bag in terms of having it spread so what we're trying to do is slow the spread as much as possible,"" said Matyas.

Shifting from trying to contain the disease, into managing it, is a different mindset for the public as well.

""From thinking that we're keeping it somewhere else, we've got to prepare to protect ourselves when it's here,"" said Braden.

Local health officials urge practicing good hygiene to reduce the risk of becoming infected with a respiratory virus, such as the flu or coronavirus. This includes:

Amid fears about a widening presence of novel coronavirus in Sonoma County, the Board of Supervisors finalized a local public health emergency Wednesday as health officials step up efforts to locate 78 local residents who may have been exposed to the disease during a San Francisco-based cruise to Mexico.

Those Sonoma County residents were among 2,600 passengers on the Grand Princess ship that returned to San Francisco Feb. 21 after a 10-day cruise. Twenty-five shared a shuttle trip from San Francisco back to Sonoma County Airport.

The move comes as the county ratchets up emergency preparations to control the spread of a virus that still is not entirely understood.

The county currently has two confirmed cases of the virus, known as COVID-19. Both patients are hospitalized in isolation, though county officials have declined to say where.

But “we now believe that there a number of other people in our community that have been exposed, and so we’re trying to identify who those folks are,” Sonoma County Health Officer Celeste Philip told supervisors during an emergency meeting Wednesday.

Partial activation of the county emergency operations center already has begun, and the county is establishing a 211 hotline intended to help residents find answers to pressing questions, Emergency Management Director Christopher Godley told supervisors.

But the county already is at a disadvantage in its efforts to gain control of the virus, in that it is still awaiting the delivery of test kits from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and so is limited in the capacity and speed with which it can attempt to detect the virus, Philip said.

She said she hoped the county receives some test kits later this week, which would reduce lag time between a patient’s expression of symptoms and confirmation of the virus. But for the moment, specimens from patients showing signs of infection have to be sent to a state lab in Richmond or a CDC lab in Atlanta for testing, she said.

That makes it critical for residents to focus on practices “that we know prevent spread of disease,” such as social distancing, hand washing and telecommuting, Philip said.

She and Godley said local medical and emergency officials had been monitoring the growth of coronavirus since long before the first cases began appearing in the United States, largely through the transfer of patients from a Diamond Princess cruise that had been quarantined in Japan until late February, when American passengers were returned to March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County and Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.

One of the patients from Travis Air Force Base who tested positive for the virus but never developed symptoms was transferred Feb. 24 to a hospital in Sonoma County, where the person remains asymptomatic, according to Rohish Lal, public information analyst with the Sonoma County Department of Health Services.

A second patient believed to have contracted the virus on a Grand Princess cruise ship voyage from San Francisco to Mexico Feb. 11-21 fell ill later and also is hospitalized in Sonoma County, health officials said. That person is in stable condition, Lal said Wednesday.

They are among at least 53 confirmed cases in California, where the first confirmed fatality included another Grand Princess passenger from Placer County, who died at Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Roseville on Wednesday, officials said.",state_of_emergency,495025
California,Sonoma,43913.04653,https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/10834733-181/sonoma-county-police-ask-for,Sonoma County law enforcement agencies ask for voluntary compliance of shelter-in-place orders,"Sonoma County law enforcement agencies ask for voluntary compliance of shelter-in-place orders

For more stories on the coronavirus, go here .

Sonoma County law enforcement agencies are prioritizing education over enforcement of the local shelter-in-place order issued last week, mirroring an approach adopted throughout the state as communities learn to adapt to the coronavirus pandemic.

The county shelter-in-place order, which began one day before a similar statewide mandate initiated Thursday by Gov. Gavin Newsom, lasts through April 7. Public health officials instructed people to stay home unless they are engaging in essential activities, ranging from picking up groceries to seeking medical attention and exercising outdoors, provided they maintain a safe distance from others.

It prevents restaurants from serving customers on site, though allows them to order food for pickup, delivery or drive-thru service. Most businesses are required to suspend operations for three weeks, except for a lengthy list of essential enterprises such as hospitals and grocery stores, which are exempted from the requirement.

Those who fail to comply with the rules laid out in the order could face a maximum of 90 days behind bars, a fine up to $1,000, or both for a misdemeanor under a California Health and Safety Code section that penalizes people who ignore orders from health officers.

A separate state health and safety code gives local sheriff’s and police departments the authority to enforce health mandates. Local agencies are hoping to forgo that route and will instead urge individuals to comply with the order voluntarily, said Petaluma Police Chief Ken Savano, who also serves as the president of the Sonoma County Law Enforcement Chiefs Association. The group of local leaders have discussed how to best unify their strategies and public messaging in response to the shelter-in-place order, Savano said.

“We want to provide clear communication and expectations and make sure that the community is informed,” Savano said.

The approach is being adopted by law enforcement agencies throughout the state as residents are told to stay home in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, said Ron Lawrence, president of the California Police Chiefs Association and chief of the Citrus Heights Police Department.

While criminals may try to take advantage of shelter-in-place orders by looting stores or committing other types of crimes, law enforcement officers understand most people violating the order are likely confused and worried about the coronavirus pandemic, he said.

“Our objective is to educate our community as best as possible, to ask for voluntary compliance,” Lawrence said.

“Police chiefs want to use enforcement as an absolute last possible resort, though obviously we have the legal authority to do it.”

Law enforcement agencies throughout Sonoma County are referring reports of businesses ignoring the law to the county Department of Health Services, though law enforcement could step in if needed, Savano said.

Dark storefronts and relatively empty roads indicate Sonoma County residents are heeding the order.

Savano said he has not heard of anyone who didn’t comply with the county’s instructions after they were given more information about the restrictions, he added.

Police officers in Santa Rosa have also seen lighter traffic and a dip in calls for help since the county issued the shelter-in-place order, Santa Rosa Police Chief Rainer Navarro said.

In a video shared on his department’s social media pages Wednesday, Navarro urged residents to follow the county’s order voluntarily.

Sonoma County Sheriff Mark Essick, whose deputies patrol the county’s unincorporated land and the contract cities of Windsor and Sonoma, shared a similar video the day prior.

“It allows us to do the job that we should be doing, which is handling emergency calls for service, rather than getting wrapped up in a call about a business that’s open or a large group,” Navarro said.

Both Savano and Navarro, whose agencies are prioritizing crucial calls for help during the shelter-in-place order, urged people to dial 211 or use online county resources to find out more information about the virus, rather than relying on dispatchers for the publicly available information. Each one of those calls can take dispatchers several minutes to resolve, Navarro said.

California,Stanislaus,,https://www.modbee.com/news/coronavirus/article241316716.html,Stanislaus court granted emergency order to limit operations,"In response to the growing coronavirus pandemic, California’s Chief Justice on Wednesday granted Stanislaus Superior Court an emergency order that will drastically limit court operations, including continuing all jury trials for at least 30 days and holding sessions outside of the courthouse, like inside detention facilities.

Stanislaus, along with neighboring San Joaquin and Calaveras counties, was among 14 courts to be granted emergency orders Wednesday. Forty-two of California’s 58 counties have received orders since Friday.

People who receive a jury summons during the dates of the order, from March 18 to April 16, are not required to appear.

During that time period, the order also allows the following:

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

The court can extend expiring emergency protective orders for 30 days without a hearing.

Preliminary hearings can be held within 15 court days of an arraignment, instead of 10 if the defendant does not waive time.

The court can wait seven court days instead of two to arraign an in-custody defendant charged with a felony.

Extends to seven days the time period for which a detained juvenile offender must have a detention hearing.

Extends the time for detained juveniles to go to trial on.

Extends the time a child removed from a home by Child Protective Services must be given a dependency proceeding.

Most matters will be continued during this time and the affected parties will be notified of their rescheduled court dates, according to the court. For more information visit the court’s website.

In its request for the order, Presiding Judge Dawna Fenchie Reeves wrote that six, or a quarter of Stanislaus Court’s judges, are over 65. On Monday, five of them began self-isolating at the direction of Governor Gavin Newsom and the sixth will do so at the conclusion of a murder trial that began this week.

One of the judges is the only judge who handles juvenile dependency hearings when children are removed from a home for safety reasons; another is the court’s only child support commissioner; and two others are assigned to criminal departments.

“Their inventories of assigned cases includes homicides, sex crimes and gang crimes,” Reeves wrote. “It will be difficult to reassign their cases to other judges given the number and complexities of those cases.”

She went on to say that about 70 of the court’s employees are parents of school-aged children who were impacted by school closures this week.

The courtrooms, assembly rooms and jury deliberation rooms are not big enough to meet social distancing standards set forth by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Reeves wrote.

“The court is urgently concerned that continued normal operations in the face of this pandemic would compromise not only the public’s health and safety, but that of the court’s judges and employees, as well as potentially their families,” she wrote.

In addition to the measures granted in the order, traffic court was closed Wednesday through April 17 and the court intends to continue most civil, probate and family law cases for six to eight weeks, as well as most pretrial matters for criminal and juvenile cases.

“It remains to be seen whether the court, in conjunction its justice partners, will have sufficient staff to maintain even the reduced service levels …. Therefore, it may soon be necessary; to further reduce calendars and court services,” Reeves wrote.

California,Sutter,,https://yubanet.com/regional/bi-county-health-officer-recommends-state-of-emergency-for-covid-19-preparedness-in-yuba-and-sutter-counties/,Bi-County Health Officer Recommends State of Emergency for COVID-19 Preparedness in Yuba and Sutter counties,"March 10, 2020 – While there remain no confirmed cases of COVID-19 (novel coronavirus) in Yuba-Sutter at this time, Bi-County Health Officer Dr. Phuong Luu today recommended both county Board of Supervisors declare a state of emergency – a step already taken by 15 other California counties that is necessary to gain access to resources that will help bolster ongoing efforts to respond to the public health threat. The Yuba County Board of Supervisors and Sutter County Board of Supervisors will consider her recommendation at their respective meetings on Tuesday, March 10, 2020.

Dr. Luu and staff from Yuba and Sutter counties believe this is the right time to make the declaration to ensure an appropriate, timely and organized response in the event COVID-19 cases are identified in the bi-county region. Dr. Luu believes it is simply a matter of time before someone in the region tests positive for the virus, so increasing monitoring and responsive capabilities now will further enable public health teams to prevent as much community transmission as possible.

Staff from both Yuba and Sutter counties have been working closely together to monitor residents who believe they could have COVID-19, communicate plans with area hospitals and health clinics, ensure nurses and first responders have the tools necessary to keep themselves healthy and safe, and communicate important information to the public. A coronavirus preparedness group was established last month, and that group has been in communication with each facet of the community – like schools, hospitals, Beale Air Force Base, and public safety entities – to ensure the area as a whole is equipped with the best knowledge and tools to minimize the impact of COVID-19.

Over the past several weeks of COVID-19 concerns, public health staff from both counties have been operating what is known as a Department Operations Center (DOC) at a low level. The DOC is now elevating to the next level and stepping up efforts to address the health threat. A bi-county Emergency Operations Center based in Yuba County has also opened. This means staff from both counties are working together around the clock to ensure that resources and staffing remain in healthy and reliable supply.

A Bi-County Call Center has been established to respond to inquiries from area residents regarding the COVID-19 threat. The Call Center number is 749-7700, and will be open 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. The Call Center is intended to field general questions, not provide medical advice. Please call your primary care physician for medical advice.

Yuba and Sutter counties have been planning for this possibility and staff are properly prepared to handle the work to come. Since there are NO confirmed cases in either county, the approach may look different from Sacramento, Placer, and other counties, where community transmission has been confirmed. Nonetheless, increasing the level of public health response is necessary in focusing vital resources on preventing severe illnesses and deaths.

With no confirmed cases at this time, and per California Department of Public Health guidelines, en masse cancellation of schools is not recommended. Schools will continue with measures to prevent spread of COVID-19. The Counties continue to work closely with the Offices of Education in both counties and their respective school districts to plan and prepare our schools for COVID-19 (those CDPH guidelines can be read here).

Dr. Luu continues to recommend hand-washing and practicing good hygiene. Vulnerable populations – the elderly and those with chronic illnesses – are encouraged to stay home as much as possible and avoid large gatherings. Keeping yourself from getting sick in the first place remains key in this effort.

If you have experienced any symptoms of acute respiratory illness such as fever, chills, or cough and have recently traveled to a country with widespread community transmission (Iran, Italy, China, South Korea), or been in close contact with a patient who has had COVID-19, immediately contact your medical provider by phone – do not go into Urgent Care, the Emergency Room or the doctor’s office. Instead, you should call your personal physician, who can assess whether your illness matches those of COVID-19 and if testing should be completed. If testing is indicated, the physician will then contact Dr. Luu, Bi-County Health Officer for consultation.

Local health officials urge practicing good hygiene to reduce the risk of becoming infected with a respiratory virus, such as the flu or coronavirus. This includes:

Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital issued quarantine orders this week to at least 30 of its hospital workers who had contact with a patient with the coronavirus, the largest isolation order publicly reported so far at a single health care facility treating patients with the infectious disease in California, the union representing most front-line hospital staff said Thursday.

The union revealed the quarantine the same day Sonoma County public health officials announced a second confirmed case of COVID-19 from a local resident seeking care at an undisclosed Santa Rosa hospital. Both people traveled on a February round-trip cruise on the Grand Princess ship from San Francisco to Mexico and returned home on a shuttle from the port to Sonoma County, public health officials said.

Sutter officials would not say if the patient who exposed the hospital workers to the coronavirus was either of two cruise ship passengers who are local residents being treated in isolation at a Santa Rosa hospital, or a third passenger from another ship, the Diamond Princess, transferred in February to a local hospital from Travis Air Force Base in Solano County.

The union issued a statement urging hospitals to protect their workers.

“The workers aren’t being tested before being sent home,” said Sean Wherley, spokesman with SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. “They’re sent home but they are potentially exposing their families. It’s not clear how this is limiting the spread.”

Sutter executives would not confirm Thursday that employees had been sent home and declined to answer a reporter’s questions, instead issuing a prepared statement through a spokeswoman.

“The safety of our patients and employees” is top priority, the spokeswoman said. The hospital continues to update our protocols regarding the coronavirus “in accordance with best practices established by federal, state and local authorities.”

The employees under isolation in the state come from a wide range of positions within the hospitals, “anyone from the housekeeper coming into the room without being advised, the phlebotomist drawing the blood, the admitting clerk who was a first point of contact,” Wherley said.

The union pressed hospitals to develop better communication lines between executives and staff, establish early assessment protocols and ensure facilities have sufficient protective equipment and enough staff on duty.

Statewide, the union estimated at least 50 caregivers had been sent home from jobs at hospitals after they treated or came into contact with patients infected with COVID-19. At least 10 health care workers were taken off the job Feb. 27 at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View and Los Gatos.

Another 10 workers were isolated Wednesday from Kaiser Permanente in Roseville, where a man who died from the disease had been under care for six days.

Two workers from Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles were quarantined Tuesday.

Wherley, whose union represents 365 workers at Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital, said he had no details about the circumstances of the quarantine in Santa Rosa.

“Hospital executives need to collaborate with employees to understand the circumstances: are there supplies in place? What’s the protocol?” Wherley said. “Workers need to be trained before a patient comes in.”

Tulare County and Visalia both declared states of emergency late last week in response to the COVID-19 virus. Fresno County and Fresno also declared a state of emergency this week.

Last night, Visalia council members ratified the city's local emergency proclamation.

""This is done mostly to take advantage of available resources, to be able to access funding, reimbursement, etc.,"" City Manager Randy Groom said.

Groom declared the local emergency Saturday in his role as director of emergency services, giving city council seven days to ratify the decision and triggering the opening of a city emergency operations center.

The Tulare County Board of Supervisors ratified two county declarations at Tuesday's board meeting, one of a local emergency and one of a local health emergency, both declared on March 11.

“We declared a local emergency to get local funding if we needed additional staffing or reimbursements for testing supplies,” Tulare County Supervisor Amy Shuklian said.

On March 4, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency in response to COVID-19. Tulare County joins at least 24 other counties in California in proclaiming a local emergency because of the virus. Fresno County supervisors also declared a local emergency Tuesday.

Tulare

Tulare City Council will also discuss COVID-19 and its local impacts at Tuesday's council meeting. Tulare has not yet declared a state of emergency. Mayor Jose Sigala told the Advance-Register he plans to request a special meeting to do so.

“We can’t wait until April 7 to have another city meeting,” he said. “This is a big issue for our city. It’s happening and we want to do everything we can to protect our employees and the public.”

The public is invited to attend Tuesday night's 7 p.m. meeting in person, but staff will have social distancing precautions in place. After city staff presents an update, council members are expected to give staff direction.

""We are all hands on deck,"" Sigala said.

Groom said that while Newsom has established recommendations to close bars, taprooms and other establishments, Visalia and its police do not have the authority to enforce those recommendations as law.

""The Council has not taken any actions to close any particular kinds of business,"" he said. ""The Chief of Police (Jason Salazar) has clarified that his department cannot enforce a recommendation or guideline.""

Sonora, CA — In the wake of federal, state and regional actions, Tuolumne County has now enacted emergency measures due to the coronavirus outbreak.

According to Health Department spokesperson Michelle Jachetta, Interim Health Officer Eric Sergienko initiated the declaration Friday afternoon. It includes an order to cancel, postpone or modify large gatherings as per state guidelines. The Tuolumne County Supervisors are expected to ratify the action at a meeting next week. Pertinent information is as follows:

The Public Health Department has activated its Department Operations Center (DOC) to effectively respond to the COVID-19 incident, including communication and coordination with the County’s federal, state, and local partners.

While there are not yet any confirmed cases within the county, the Acting Tuolumne County Health Officer has declared a local health emergency in order to enhance the effectiveness of the response to COVID-19, to seek and utilize mutual aid, potentially obtain reimbursement, and ensure that the County’s public health professionals and providers have all necessary resources to provide quality care and keep our community safe. Along with this declaration, Dr. Sergienko has issued an order to support the guidance on mass gatherings released by the State this week.

Testing

Testing is being conducted at the discretion of health care providers in the community, based on their clinical assessment and currently recommended guidance. Tests that will be conducted through the Public Health laboratory system are coordinated with the County Public Health Department. Testing is available through Quest laboratories with a health care provider’s order. These tests are not required to be communicated through the Public Health Department, but local providers are strongly encouraged to do so. Any positive test result must be reported to the Public Health Department

Mass Gatherings

Guidance from the State was issued on March 11th regarding mass gatherings in an effort to slow the rate of transmission of COVID-19 in California. You can review the guidance details here. Dr. Sergienko has issued an order to support and implement these state recommendations in Tuolumne County.

Schools

At this time it is not being recommended to close schools as Tuolumne county does not currently have any confirmed cases of COVID-19 and no evidence of community spread. It is of more benefit to allow students to continue to attend school with the implementation of the recommended increase in hygiene and monitoring practices, as well as suggested limitation of some activities. Recommended actions for schools can be found here. Please do not send your children to school if they are ill and/or have a fever without taking medication.

What You Can Do

The CDC has updated information and guidance for specific audiences such as businesses, healthcare professionals, schools, community- and faith-based organizations, vulnerable populations, and more here. The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) also has specific guidance documents available here.

Practice everyday preventions to stay healthy. Wash your hands thoroughly and frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, or with hand sanitizer when soap is not available. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. If you are ill, stay at home. If other family members are ill, including children, keep them home.

Practice social distancing: put more space between yourself and others. About six feet is good, if possible. Avoid contact with people who are sick.

Clean frequently touched surfaces and objects often with soap and water or household cleaners. Don’t forget your cell phone.

If you have symptoms or get sick…

Stay home, unless you need to seek medical care. Call ahead before visiting your doctor, clinic, or hospital. Wear a face mask to avoid spreading germs.

Cover your cough with a tissue and immediately throw it in the trash, or cough into your bent elbow. Wash your hands after using a tissue. Wash your hands often and avoid sharing personal items.",state_of_emergency,53874

A local health emergency was declared in Ventura County as public health officials reported the county's third travel-related COVID-19 case less than 24 hours after announcing the second case.

The third case, reported by officials on Thursday, involved a county resident returning after journeying to Egypt, said Ashley Bautista, Ventura County public information officer. It still has to be confirmed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The county is also awaiting CDC confirmation in a case announced Wednesday involving a person returning from travel in Italy.

The emergency declaration by Ventura County Public Health Officer Robert Levin labels the spread of virus as an imminent threat. Officials said the decision was triggered by the rise in local cases, the nationwide spread of the novel coronavirus and Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement that scheduled events statewide expected to attract more than 250 people should be canceled or postponed.

Coronavirus: Here's what we know about cancellations, closures in Ventura Count

""The declaration will enhance our ability to take further lifesaving actions as we continue to respond to this evolving health and safety threat,"" said Ventura County Executive Officer Mike Powers. ""These actions will allow us to have even greater coordination to protect our residents and prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our communities. We will continue to mobilize county resources, coordinate with agencies and partners and raise awareness about how everyone can take action to be prepared.""

The declaration could also bring state and federal funding to aid with the county's response, said Bautista.

Public health leaders asked businesses, schools and other groups to begin implementing social-distancing plans that involve online classes, work-at-home arrangements and other strategies to limit interaction that can spread viruses.

""That doesn't mean these places have to close down,"" Bautista said, adding the goal is to come up with ways to limit exposure.

All three reported COVID-19 cases in the county involve people exposed during travel — not person-to-person spread in the general community.

Limited information was released on the county's third case. It involved a returning traveler who spent little time out in the community, meaning the risk of exposure is considered low, said Bautista.

The case announced Wednesday night involved a county resident who flew into Los Angeles International Airport after traveling to Italy. The traveler sought medical attention at an undisclosed location in Los Angeles County before returning home to Ventura County, said Bautista.

FYI: Here's what we know about higher-risk groups, coronavirus in Ventura County

Testing for the coronavirus was initiated by a health-care provider at an undisclosed site in Los Angeles County. The person is believed to have not had contact with people in Ventura County.

The county's first case, confirmed by the CDC on Tuesday, involved a passenger who was on a Grand Princess cruise in February.

Two more COVID-19 test results were still pending as of Thursday. At least 95 people had been tested in Ventura County.

Newsom's announcement not only calls for gatherings to be canceled but says smaller events should be arranged so people are separated from each other by at least 6 feet.

Levin's local health emergency declaration is set to be considered for ratification by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. Several cities also declared a state of emergency on Thursday and Friday, including Camarillo, Thousand Oaks, Fillmore, Simi Valley, Moorpark and Oxnard. City councils are scheduled to consider ratifying the declarations.

""The news can sound scary and rightfully so,"" said Thousand Oaks Mayor Al Adam of the coronavirus. ""However, I encourage everyone to proceed with a calm focus and keep compassion for each other at heart.""

Efforts to slow the local spread of coronavirus escalated Wednesday, with Ventura County public health officials ordering several restrictions leading to the temporary closures of certain businesses and shelter-in-place orders for vulnerable populations.

The order requires all Ventura County residents age 75 and older to shelter in place through April 1. The shelter-in-place order also applies to residents age 70 and older with underlying health issues.

Those ordered to shelter in place will still be allowed to travel outdoors as long as they maintain a distance of six feet from every other person. The shelter-in-place order restricts all public travel except for essential reasons such as medical care, nutrition or to perform necessary work in the fields of government or healthcare.

In response to the new restrictions, many city governments across the county closed their city halls from public access, though employees were still permitted to work on site.

Cities participating in the temporary closures include Camarillo, Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai, Oxnard, Thousand Oaks and Ventura. Each city continues to offer services online or over the phone. More information can be found on the city's respective websites.

Simi Valley plans to close its city hall to the public beginning Thursday, while Port Hueneme will close city hall on Friday, officials said.

Santa Paula city officials said as of Wednesday that its Parks and Recreation programs including the senior center, youth center and front desk were closed until at least March 31.

The Santa Paula council was set to meet Wednesday night to consider additional closures, according to Jackie Nuñez in the city manager's office. Any updates will be posted on the city's website, she added.

The county's public health order also instructed all bars and restaurants to restrict food options to take-out, delivery or drive-through services exclusively. All bars and nightclubs that do not prepare food will be ordered to close through April 1.

Closures were also ordered for all gyms, fitness centers, public pools, movie theaters, performance venues, bowling alleys, arcades, wineries, breweries and tap rooms.

The closures will be in place for two weeks, from Wednesday through April 1, unless the Ventura County Public Health officials announce otherwise.

Six new cases of COVID-19 investigated: Ventura County ramps up efforts to fight outbreak

Those found not in compliance with the public health order may face legal consequences. A violation is considered a misdemeanor with the possibility of a fine, imprisonment or both, the order says.

On Tuesday, Ventura County Public Health officials announced six additional presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 were under investigation. The cases had not been verified with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Five of the cases appear to be caused by community transmission, local public health officials said Wednesday, although the cases await confirmation by the CDC.In total, 10 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ventura County, with only one confirmed with the CDC. One case involving an 8-year-old child had been reported positive but later walked back as further testing showed negative. The case is under investigation by the CDC.

Officials with the Yolo County Health and Human Services Agency believe the woman acquired the virus through community transmission, meaning she had not traveled to an infected area or had known contact with an infected person.

The patient is an older woman with underlying health conditions, according to a news release from Yolo County. She is hospitalized and improving.

“Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 around the world, I am not surprised that the virus is in our county”, Yolo County Public Health Officer, Dr. Ron Chapman in a written statement, said.

Yolo County also announced it will issue a local health emergency, along with a local emergency related to coronavirus. The proclamations will allow the county to receive funding and other resources to control the spread of coronavirus.

California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency on Wednesday. Several other counties, including Sacramento and Placer have declared local emergencies.

”This is obviously a challenging situation which makes it all the more important to remain calm, practice the public health guidelines and rely only on factual information from trusted medical sources,” Yolo County Board of Supervisors Chair Gary Sand said in a statement.

According to the CDC, coronavirus (COVID-19) is a family of viruses that is spreadable from person to person. Coronavirus is believed to have been first detected in a seafood market in Wuhan, China in December 2019. If someone is sick with coronavirus, the symptoms they may show include mild to severe respiratory illness, cough, and difficulty breathing.

Currently, there is no vaccine, however, the CDC suggests the following precautions, along with any other respiratory illness:

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Stay home when you are sick.

Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.

Wash your hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds.

The CDC also says facemasks should only be used by people who show symptoms of the virus. If you’re not sick, you do not have to wear a facemask. The CDC says the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low.

California,Yuba,,https://yubanet.com/regional/statewide-shelter-in-place-order-replaces-yuba-sutter-directive/,Statewide “Shelter In Place” order replaces Yuba-Sutter directive,"March 20, 2020 – California Governor Gavin Newsom announced a “Shelter In Place” statewide order Thursday evening that effectively replaced the Yuba-Sutter “directive” just hours before it went into effect.

Under the order, “all individuals living in the State of California (are) to stay home or at their place of residence, except as needed to follow the federal critical infrastructure sectors.”

The statewide order, which went into effect immediately, is a mandate that is enforceable. Businesses that must close include restaurants (except for takeout or delivery orders), bars/nightclubs, entertainment venues, gyms/fitness studios, public events and gatherings, and convention centers.

“Our Yuba-Sutter community needs to take in this information calmly, as our residents were already prepared to be in their homes to reduce the chance of exposure to the coronavirus,” said Yuba-Sutter Health Officer Dr. Phuong Luu. “This is NOT martial law, and nothing has to change overnight. The state’s order has the same guidelines that were in the Yuba-Sutter directive, so you’re all prepared to stay home as much as possible, except for essential activities, to help slow the spread of COVID-19.”

Luu emphasized residents will still be able to take walks, play with their children in the yard, and make necessary trips to grocery stores, banks, gas stations, pharmacies, and laundromats. Residents can also keep appointments with their doctors.

The state established a website to outline the Shelter In Place order and list essential services. It can be found at: covid19.ca.gov

Colorado,Alamosa,,https://alamosanews.com/article/alamosa-county-declares-state-of-emergency,Alamosa County declares state of emergency,"ALAMOSA — A state of emergency was declared Wednesday by the Alamosa Board of County Commissioners at a special meeting here after hearing presentations from different specialists within the county.

The board also approved a public health order limiting gatherings to 30 people or less. It is important to mention that the order does not include restaurants, homeless shelter or religious services, as long as these entities adhere to the requirements for social distancing. Currently restaurants are closed for all but take-out, per State Order.Also, the order also does not include schools. In the future, it may be determined that school closures are necessary. Schools, parents and employers should take steps now to prepare for the possibility of prolonged mandatory closures.

While being in a state of emergency sounds menacing, it will likely not affect most citizens on a day-to-day basis. The two main things it does are, it makes Alamosa County Public Health and Environment (ACDPHE), incident command and imbues the ACDPHE with the ability to issue orders and guidance to protect public health. And it charges Alamosa’s Sheriff with keeping order and enforcing ACDPHE orders.

Beyond that, the remainder of the declaration is focused on the County Administrator and Emergency Manager working to ensure a strong line of communication and an effective response for the public. All things that will be very helpful helping Alamosa get to May safely.

At the meeting on Wednesday, Public Information Officer Linda Smith presented first discussing the importance of public information during this trying time.

“We have been pushing out public information and doing everything that we can to support what the public health agencies are doing,” said Smith. She also discussed a federal government based program that could in the future provide personal protective equipment (PPE) like masks and gloves to the valley. However, Smith was sure to make it clear that that was just a possibility and was in no way concrete.

“That’s still very much in the air because we don’t know what that’s going to look like,” Smith went on to reaffirm the importance of information, stating that her office’s focus was shifting away from testing results and more towards paying the current situation the proper respect, adhering to advice coming from proper avenues meaning the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and other reputable sources.

Fellow presenter Lilian Coll, Alamosa’s regional epidemiologist, also touched on the hot button issue of test results in Alamosa, confirming that as of press time that there have been five tests from Alamosa that have been sent out and of those one has come back negative. Smith pushed that despite the San Luis Valley still being free of positive cases, that the populace needs to remain vigilant in their hygiene and health practices because COVID-19 is likely present in the valley.

Though not on the agenda, Dr. Bill Brinton MD, internist-general, was in attendance and weighed in on some similar issues, first lamenting the sheer volume of information that is bombarding the public currently before discussing preparedness.

“I do think Alamosa county and the counties of the valley have an advantage,” said Brinton, “Because we had established plans in place both for bioterrorism starting in 2001 and pandemic influenza starting in 2005, and the planning was well in place by the time the pandemic came in about 2008. We also exercised our plans for the Alamosa Salmonella outbreak around that same time.”

Brinton presented an opportunity to the medical professionals of the valley stating that since we have yet to be infected that we could use this time to look to other counties similar to ours and come up with an effective response. He closed his comments on the current situation by addressing a need for PPE among healthcare workers and ill persons.

Smith addressed the PPE supply chain issues and spoke on a prioritization matrix for that, which the state seems to be doing at the that level as well, which would suggest a possible relief in the future.

Also presenting to the board was Emergency Manager Eric Treinen. Treinen discussed the transition from an operations center to a Unified Command Group (UCG). He suggested that the UGC would offer more resources, personnel and would allow the county staff to focus on local issues.

Among the changes, Treinen addressed the addition of a second Public Information Officer to help work alongside Linda Smith who has been working tirelessly to keep the public abreast of any changes on Coronavirus.

“I’ve been sharing a lot of information with Gigi (Dennis) and the board to how best help our county and what is the best we can do for our county,” Treinen said.

For information on the virus and other health concerns in relation to the illness, citizens are urged to visit Slvemergency.org as well as the associated Facebook page and the Alamosa County Public Health webpage. Those looking to get in contact with Public Health can email [email protected]

Public Health Order

Pursuant to Section 25-1- 506 (2)(a)(I), Colorado Revised Statutes, this Order is effective

within the entirety of Alamosa County, including all towns within the county, until April

22, 2020.

On March 10, 2020, the Governor of Colorado declared a state of emergency related to

the presence of COVID-19 in the State. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment has confirmed that COVID-19 continues to spread throughout the State of

Colorado.

On March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a National Emergency

due to COVID-19.

On March 15, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance to

cancel or postpone in-person events that consist of 50 people or more throughout the United States for 8 weeks.

On March 16, 2020, the President of the United States issued a statement including

recommendations to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people.

The age, condition, and health of a significant portion of the population in Alamosa

County places it at risk of serious health complications, including death, from COVID-19.

Although most individuals who contract COVID-19 do not become seriously ill, persons

with mild symptoms and asymptomatic persons with COVID-19 may place other

PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT

vulnerable members of the public at significant risk. A large surge in the number of

persons with serious infections can compromise the ability of the healthcare system to

deliver necessary healthcare to the public.

The limitations on large gatherings and the use of social distancing decrease the risk of

COVID-19 transmission to our most vulnerable populations, and is especially

important for people who are over 60 years old and those with chronic health

conditions due to their higher risk of severe illness and death from COVID-19. This Order

will reduce the likelihood that many individuals will be exposed to COVID-19 at a single event, and will, therefore, slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities.

This Order is adopted pursuant to the legal authority set forth in sections 25-1-506 and

25-1-508, Colorado Revised Statutes. Under these laws, the local Public Health Director

has the duty to investigate and control the causes of epidemic or communicable

diseases and conditions affecting public health and to establish, maintain, and

enforce isolation and quarantine, and in pursuance thereof, and for this purpose only,

to exercise physical control over property and over the persons of the people within the

jurisdiction of the agency as the agency may find necessary for the protection of the

public health. All events must follow the requirements stated herein.

DEFINITIONS

For purposes of this Order:

An “Event” is a group gathering that takes place indoors or outdoors with a capacity of

30 or more persons and that have 30 or more persons present in one room or

continuous space.

“Event” does not include activities that are primarily individual or occur in small groups

or in non-congregate settings, such as places of employment and restaurants, as long as

persons present are able to maintain adequate social distancing, as well as hygiene and

sanitization recommendations as defined below. At this point, this order also does not

pertain to schools or homeless shelters or religious services.

ORDER

A. All events 30 people or more are prohibited.

B. Events with fewer than 30 attendees should follow the following steps to mitigate

risks:

1. Older adults (age 60 and older) and individuals with underlying medical conditions that

are at increased risk of serious COVID-19, including employees, are encouraged not

to attend.

2. Social distancing recommendations should be met. These include limiting contact of people within 6 feet from each other for 10 minutes or longer, and any

other applicable guidance. See Section Ill, below.

3. Individuals who are sick should stay home.

4. Proper hand hygiene and sanitation should be readily available to all

attendees and employees.

5. Environmental cleaning guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention (CDC) should be followed (e.g., clean and disinfect high touch

surfaces daily or more frequently).

As of Monday afternoon, Douglas County offices will remain open, and conduct business as usual.

Douglas County Public Health Officer Kathy Ronchi wants to make sure the public is doing all they can to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

""I think it's just really, really important for people not to become fatigued of hearing the warnings that we're giving. That people continue to do these things. We all have heard how many times wash your hands, stay six feet away from other people if you can, avoid large gatherings and for goodness sakes, stay home when you're sick,"" Ronchi said.

A resolution will be formally submitted to the city council on Tuesday night, asking them to vote to declare the state of emergency.

Colorado,Eagle,,https://www.vaildaily.com/news/eagle-declares-local-emergency-in-coronavirus-fight/,Eagle declares ‘local emergency’ in coronavirus fight,"Eagle Town Board Candidate Forum Canceled Eagle's Chamber of Commerce canceled the town board candidate forum, scheduled for Wednesday evening. Eagle's municipal election is still scheduled for April 7. Eagle voters will elect a town board, determine the fate of the town's home rule proposal, and decide whether revenue from a tobacco tax will stay with the town or go to Eagle County's government coffers.

EAGLE — Eagle’s town manager declared a local emergency and canceled all non-essential, non-government meetings and events and has closed public access to town-owned facilities on a rolling basis to limit exposure and slow the transmission of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus.

Eagle Town Manager Brandy Reitter took the measures Monday to protect the Eagle community and town workforce.

She declared a local emergency that allows greater flexibility in deploying town employees and acquiring needed equipment, supplies and other resources.

“Please be assured that the town is taking what we feel are cautious and prudent steps in partnership with Eagle County and the State of Colorado,” Eagle Mayor Anne McKibbin said. “Our priority is the health of our community members, maintaining essential town services, and taking steps to help minimize the spread of COVID-19 or novel coronavirus. We ask for your patience, and cooperation, in this effort.”

Operational changes and closing town facilities should limit person-to-person spread of the virus. These changes include but may not be limited to:

Consolidation of in-person business transaction activity at Town Hall

Shifting non-essential services to telephone-only

Reduction of hours for various departments

Reitter’s emergency declaration orders non-essential, non-public safety municipal workers, whose duties allow, to begin making arrangements with supervisors to temporarily work remotely from home through April 1, 2020. The goal of these arrangements is to continue to provide as many town services as possible while minimizing in-person contact.

Eagle’s board of trustees and other boards, commissions and appointed bodies will continue to meet. Times, dates and locations will be published and shared on the town’s website, through email, and in other ways.

The town board is holding a special meeting Thursday to review legislation enabling boards and commissions to hold electronic meetings.

Colorado,Fremont,43906.74306,https://www.canoncitydailyrecord.com/fremont-county-commissioners-declare-local-emergency-disaster-close-county-buildings,"Fremont County Commissioners declare local emergency disaster, close county buildings","Citing the potential of Fremont County being impacted by the COVID-19 virus, the Board of County Commissioners declared a local emergency disaster Monday morning and has closed all county buildings – with the exception of the Sheriff’s Office and courthouse – closed to the public effective immediately and through the end of the day Friday.

Commission Chair Debbie Bell said citizens will be notified via the county’s website, Facebook pages and notices placed on all entrances how to accomplish their county business using the telephone, websites or designated drop boxes.

According to the resolution declaring a local disaster emergency, the potential outbreak of COVID-19 in Fremont County constitutes a local disaster particularly because of the high number of elderly residents and incarcerated persons combined with the confirmed presence of COVID-19 in a number of Colorado counties, including those adjacent to and in close proximity of Fremont County.

The resolution states that the “Fremont County Department of Public Health and Environment anticipates that, due to the contagiousness of the illness and the fact that numerous travelers from around the world visit the county, Fremont County will see cases of the virus and its transmission within the community.”

Developing social distancing policies prior to an extensive outbreak has been a proven means of helping to contain COVID-19 outbreaks, the resolution states.

FCDPHE anticipates that without appropriately responding to the illness, including postponing and canceling large public events, numbers of cases within Fremont County will rise, may result in serious illness or death for certain members of the community, and also will have the effect of interrupting the functioning of the community in terms of work and school attendance.

The Fremont County community is strongly directed to engage in social distancing and to postpone or cancel any gatherings or events where people will congregate in large numbers and/or in close contact with one another, the resolution states.

County employees will continue to report for work and be assigned tasks based on their position by their supervisors; however, these tasks could involve assisting with sanitizing of the office spaces, Bell said. Employees who are systematic consistent with COVID-19 (fever, respiratory, etc.) are to notify their supervisor immediately.

Employees who are placed in isolation/quarantine by a medical professional or the Department of Public Health are to follow the orders of such. County employees pay status will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

Boys & Girls Club of Fremont County is closing its doors for the next two weeks

“While it is not mandated that we close at this time, we feel that it is the prudent thing to do,” said Darcy Cole, CEO. “We will re-evaluate on Friday, March 27. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause the families that we serve. We are reaching out to our community partners to help in any way that we are able.”

County commissioners extended the coronavirus pandemic local disaster emergency Monday, and authorized a $100,000 emergency food assistance grant to LIFT-UP to help ensure no one in the county goes hungry.

LIFT-UP is in the process of developing plans to increase distribution at mobile pop-ups across the county.

Last year, LIFT-UP served 625 families per month on average, but the new grant would allow them to serve far more as people deal with the medical, and economic costs of COVID-19.

“With this new plan, we believe we would be able to serve 700 families every week,” Angela Mills, executive director of LIFT-UP, told the commissioners by phone at Monday’s meeting.

The commissioners unanimously approved the emergency grant given the importance of food security in uncertain economic times.

“I don’t want anybody to go hungry during this in Garfield County,” Commissioner Tom Jankovsky said.

If additional funding is required to make that happen, Jankovsky said LIFT-Up should return to request it.

“If for some reason you have to go up to 800 or 900 families per week, then do that and come back for additional funding,” Jankovsky said.

LIFT-UP will begin distributing the meals two days per week in most cities and towns in Garfield County, and once per week in Parachute.

In Rifle, distribution will take place at the Garfield County Fairgrounds.

The distribution process would also be similar LIFT-Up’s Friday’s distribution, with drive-up pickup, and very little contact with intake staff.

LIFT-UP’s Extended Table program has shifted to a grab-and-go prepared meal kit.

Jankovsky also said it would be prudent to plan on the increased distribution through the month of May, as the economic recovery from social distancing could last for some time after the peak of the pandemic.

The county’s emergency reserve fund currently has more than $3 million. The Garfield County Sheriff’s Office also has access to $500,000 for declared emergencies. That fund is usually used to deal with wildfire emergencies.

The county’s new disaster emergency declaration extends the March 17 declaration indefinitely by tying it to Colorado’s state of emergency.

For now, Garfield County’s emergency declaration regarding COVID-19 will be in place until the state says it’s lifted, but the resolution “also allows the commissioners to at any point take charge of it, and make your own decision too,” county attorney Tari Williams said.

The Garfield County Public Health Department has also aligned their orders with Gov. Jared Polis’ orders to maintain consistency.

The state’s orders change from day to day as the pandemic response shifts, Garfield County Public Health director Yvonne Long told the commissioners.

Aligning the local orders to the state’s orders made sense to reduce confusion and local staff efforts, Long said.

“We felt at this particular time that was the better way to go, rather than try to rewrite them every day,” Long said.

To volunteer with LIFT-UP, call 970-456-2804. LIFT-UP is also looking for donations of new reusable shopping bags and nonperishable food items.

The county Public Health Department has also set up several hotlines for members of the public and the business community seeking guidance on how they can help in limiting the spread of the pandemic and volunteer to assist those who will be adversely affected.

For those with symptoms, or general questions about the disease, how to self-quarantine, or questions about symptoms, call the bilingual Aspen to Parachute COVID-19 hotline: 970-429-6186. Operators speak Spanish and English and can transfer callers to medical professionals for advice about dealing with personal symptoms and those seeking testing. However, tests for the coronavirus are being reserved for the most severe cases, according to public health officials. This hotline can also transfer callers to mental health professionals. The hotline hours are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week.

For businesses, faith-based organizations, schools and other organizations seeking information on how to clean, manage events, or other issues related to the outbreak, the county has set up a hotline at 970-945-1377, extension 8120, or email publichealthinfo@garfield-county.com. This hotline is also available to Spanish speakers.

For people seeking opportunities to help others in their community, Garfield County has set up a clearinghouse to connect volunteers to those in need at 970-945-1377, extension 2020. Spanish speakers may also call this hotline, but a response may be delayed.

In light of the first two confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Garfield County March 14, the board of county commissioners declared a local disaster emergency Monday.

The declaration is a necessary step to activate funding for response and recovery efforts. The “cost and magnitude of responding to and recovering from the impact of the ensuing event is far in excess of the county’s available resources,” the order states.

The declaration of the emergency is valid for seven days, but can be renewed while the disaster lasts.

Friday’s order from the county reflects just how many orders have come in the past week from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE). The most recent order came Friday as Gov. Jared Polis announced the closure of tattoo parlors, salons and more.

The order also explains that gatherings are limited to 10 people or less.

One exception described in Garfield County’s order is for animal shelters.

“Garfield County interprets the CDPHE’s exemptions of certain businesses and facilities to closure set forth in its March 18, 2020 version of Public Health Order 20-22 in Section III to include animal shelters, such as Colorado Animal Rescue and the Rifle Animal Shelter,” the order states.

Any future orders from CDPHE or Polic related to COVID-19 will also be “immediately in effect as if issued as a Garfield County Public Health Standing Order unless otherwise stated,” the release states.

As the number of known cases of the new coronavirus in Larimer County increased, county officials formalized their declaration of an emergency pertaining to the spread of the virus.

The declaration, which was ratified by the county commissioners Tuesday, opens access to state and federal resources, including funding and caches of medical supplies.

Tom Gonzales, director of public health for Larimer County, told the commissioners during their Tuesday morning meeting that the county had three positive cases of the coronavirus and “we only expect that number to increase.” A fourth case was identified late Tuesday afternoon.

On Tuesday, the county health department confirmed a second known case linked to a Loveland long-term care facility. A worker and resident — a woman in her 90s — at the North Shore Health & Rehab Facility have tested positive for coronavirus.

The worker lives in Weld County, and that case was announced Monday, while the case involving the resident was announced Tuesday.

Larimer County's first case, a Johnstown resident who is also a health care worker, was announced March 9.

The third case is a Fort Collins man in his 40s. The fourth case is a woman in her 50s who lives in Fort Collins. Both are quarantined in their homes.

Woodward Inc. confirmed a worker at its Drake Road facility tested positive for the virus. The facility has been shut down for a thorough cleaning, Woodward spokeswoman Julie James said. It was expected to be closed for a ""few days.""

The manufacturing company is not releasing any information about the worker, including which shift the person worked or the person's hometown, James said.

Woodward shut the plant down on Tuesday and sent workers home. All workers will be paid for time lost due to the closure. More details are expected to be released by Woodward later.

Coronavirus in Colorado: Tracking the confirmed cases, latest news and updates

To stem the spread of the virus, Gonzales said he will prohibit gatherings of more than 50 people, as recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He previously prohibited gatherings of 250 people or more.

The county also will enforce the state's 30-day closure of bars, restaurants, theaters, gyms, breweries, and other gathering places.

Restaurants: As restaurants face 30-day closure, food delivery sites brace for impact

As of Tuesday, there were at least 183 positive COVID-19 cases in the state. Two people have died following infection.

On Tuesday, the Weld County Department of Public Health and Environment announced a man in that county died from coronavirus.

He was in his 70s. It marks the second death related to coronavirus in Colorado.

Gonzales is also looking into changing how Larimer County tracks potential cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, because the state is so backlogged on testing. The state can process 250 tests a day; it has about 1,500 tests backlogged, Gonzales said.

For example, people who display symptoms of the disease and are considered high-risk — as in older than 60 or with underlying health conditions — would undergo a “panel” of tests to check for influenza and other viruses. Then, if a person comes up negative for flu and other diseases, they will be considered positive for COVID-19. That person then would be isolated.

“We are trying to look at things creatively because of the backlog on tests,” he said.

The commissioners allocated $500,000 in reserve funds to pay for staff time and supplies used in responding to the crisis. Last week, the county spent about $50,000 on staff time and $10,000 on supplies.

Colorado,Morgan,43910.09097,https://www.fortmorgantimes.com/covid-19-morgan-county-declares-state-of-emergency,COVID-19: Morgan County declares state of emergency,"Morgan County declared a state of emergency on Thursday, March 19, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic that has had disruptive impacts on the people and functions of the county.

Emergency Manager Roger Doll said it would be prudent to declare a state of emergency during the Morgan County Board of County Commissioners special meeting Thursday morning.

“It would allow us to enact policies and procedures to protect the citizens of Morgan County, as well as the employees,” Doll said.

The declaration permits access to emergency funds, federal and state assistance, and allows the county to adjust policies, procedures and ordinances to ensure the public welfare. The commissioners thought a state of emergency was appropriate, not just to address potential community spread of COVID-19, but any subsequent effects.

Most county buildings are closed, but services are still available. The only building that will remain open to the public is the Morgan County Department of Human Services. It will remain open but take preventative measures inside the building and offices.

Many of the services at the county DHS building are to be primarily handled online, by phone and through the mail.

The Department of Human Services is working on how to adjust many of their programs. They are cutting all non-essential home visits, and people looking for assistance benefits are encouraged to use the online portal at Colorado.gov/peak.

The services at the Morgan County Administration Building for motor vehicle services, recording services and election services are available both online and through the mail.

Vehicle registration renewals can be done online at mydmv.colorado.gov, by phone at 970-542-3521, through the mail at P.O. Box 1399, Fort Morgan or drop your registration documents and payment at the drop box by the Administration Building in Fort Morgan.

Recording services similarly can be put into the county’s drop box or done online and people are encouraged to call the office for guidance.

Voter registration can be updated at govotecolorado.gov. If the Internet isn’t available, people can call in to the clerk’s office and request registration forms be sent to them.

The sheriff’s office has suspended all inmate visitations at the Morgan County Jail, and it is giving inmates two free 15-minute phone calls a week to compensate. Besides the distancing, the sheriff’s office are continuing with their normal operations.

“We are proceeding with normal business, taking necessary precautions for our staff and our inmate welfare,” Sheriff Dave Martin said.

The Planning and Zoning Department is working on using online forms to aid them in issuing building permits both online and by phone.

Other departments, like the Public Works Department, Finance Department, and the Information Systems Department don’t have much public contact, but they are making sure their workplace habits are hygienic.

The Information Systems Department is working to keep up to date information on the website while many of their services migrate online. The websites will also host public meetings held by the commissioners while the buildings are closed.

The resolution to close all buildings passed with 2-1 vote, with Commissioner Jon Becker abstaining.

“I think self-policing is always the best bet,” Commissioner Becker said. “As we’re dealing with a pandemic, I don’t take that lightly, but I also don’t take lightly the livelihoods of people sitting out there and their ability to know what they can or cannot do.”

The other two commissioners disagreed, saying that despite the physical closure of the office all services were still available, and that it wouldn’t cause further panic.

“The county is open. We have limited access, and you’re capable of still completing your business with Morgan County,” Commissioner Jim Zwetzig said.",state_of_emergency,28404
Colorado,Sedgwick,,https://www.kansas.com/news/coronavirus/article241405696.html,Sedgwick County will consider stay-at-home orders,"Updated at 11:09 a.m. Monday: Sedgwick County commissioners will hold a special meeting at 4 p.m. Monday to discuss whether to institute a stay-at-home order or take other actions in response to coronavirus.

“I would say It is talking about what actions its going to take as a county, whether we are going to stay the same, whether we are going to enact a stay-at-home ordinance” said county commissioner Lacy Cruse. “Those are the kinds of things that hopefully we will decide today.

Sedgwick County reported its second coronavirus case over the weekend, with 14 Kansas counties now reporting positive cases.

County commissioners will discuss whether stay-at-home orders are needed to slow the spread of the virus here, similar to what the Kansas City metro area is doing.

“If you leave bars open, people are going to go to bars, that’s just the reality of our situation,” said Sedgwick County commissioner Lacey Cruse.

County counselor Mike Pepoon promised to have a draft of a stay-at-home order for commissioners to consider by Wednesday at the latest.

Physician Garold Minns, the county’s health officer, said Sunday that if he could shut down everything he would, but the consequences of doing that would be worse than the disease.

“I think the community is actually coming along pretty well,” he said during a news conference Sunday. “I think it is better to do what we are doing.”

The Sedgwick County case involved a man who is under the age of 60 and has a history of traveling to Colorado, according to Sedgwick County spokeswoman Kate Flavin. The man was tested by his doctor and is at home in isolation.

The Sedgwick County Health Department “has identified that the only close contacts were household members,” Flavin said in a news release. “They will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms.”

Sedgwick County and the state of Kansas are almost out of testing supplies. In Sedgwick County, first responders, health care workers, people in the hospital and people over age 60 who are exhibiting symptoms of the disease will be given priority for testing.

The number of Kansas cases climbed to 64 as of 10 a.m. Sunday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported. The KDHE report included a second Kansas death related to the virus.

More than 32,000 cases of the virus had been identified across the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. At least 400 people have died from it.

The second death in Kansas was a Johnson County man in his 70s man who had underlying health conditions and no travel history, The Kansas City Star reported. Additionally, The Star reported an additional two cases in Douglas County.

The Kansas City metro area is under orders to stay at home effective Tuesday. The order requires residents of Kansas City and Johnson, Jackson and Wyandotte counties to remain at home except for activities “essential to the health and safety” of themselves, family members or friends, such as getting medical attention or food. Residents can also go to work if their employer is deemed an essential business. On Sunday, Leavenworth County issued similar restrictions.

Violations will be considered misdemeanor offenses, punishable by a $500 fine and up to 6 months in jail.

The order is for 30 days, but could be extended.

The first Sedgwick County case was reported Thursday as a woman who was over 60.

Kansas has seen cases grow by double digits the past three days.

The 64 confirmed cases do not include two cases in Ford and Miami counties that were diagnosed in out-of-state residents. Those two will be counted in their home states, the KDHE said.",shelter_in_place,2360
Colorado,Summit,,https://www.summitdaily.com/news/summit-county-expected-to-order-widespread-business-closures/,Summit County orders widespread business closures amid COVID-19 outbreak,"Editor’s note: This story has been updated to correct that marijuana dispensaries will be allowed to remain open.

BRECKENRIDGE — Summit County officials issued a public health order Monday afternoon, announcing sweeping business closures throughout the area to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The order will include all municipalities. Only banks, grocery stores, liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries, pharmacies and gas stations will remain open.

According to a statement from the county, dine-in activity in all restaurants, bars and cafeterias in Summit County will be prohibited beginning at 10 p.m. Monday. Restaurants will be allowed to continue providing delivery and takeout options.

“Our restaurant owners and their employees work hard every day to ensure food safety for their customers by practicing good handwashing, preventing cross contamination and excluding sick employees,” Summit County Public Health Director Amy Wineland said in a news release that confirmed the order to close. “During this COVID-19 response, they are working even harder to ensure that the food they produce is safe. Because the primary mode of COVID-19 transmission is person-to-person — not through the preparation, service and consumption of food — we believe that take-out and delivery services pose very low risk to the public and serve a critical need in the community.”

In addition, the Summit Stage and Breckenridge Free Ride bus services will be suspended at the end of service Monday and will not resume until further notice. Ride share services will be permitted to operate until 11:59 p.m. Monday, and service will be suspended afterward. All shuttle services will be allowed to operate until noon Thursday, though county officials are emphasizing that such services should be used only for transporting visitors out of the county or residents back to the area.

All retail businesses that see foot traffic from the general public also will be required to close effective 10 p.m. Monday. All lodging businesses — including hotels, motels, timeshares and short-term rentals — are required to be closed by noon Thursday.

According to the county, the closures will last indefinitely, meaning the length of the closure is undetermined.

“The quicker we shut everything down, the quicker this all goes away,” Breckenridge Mayor Eric Mamula said.

Services and businesses to remain open Federal, state, local and special district facilities, public utilities and utility service providers (electric utility providers, internet service providers, water and sewer service providers)

Banks, title companies, grocery stores, pet food stores, hardware stores

Medical service providers, including hospitals, doctors offices, physical therapists and pharmacies, medical supply companies, dental offices and veterinarians

Retail gas stations, car dealerships, auto mechanic facilities, car rental companies

Department stores, like Walmart and Target

The sale of food and beverages — including liquor, beer and wine — is limited to carry-out. Food and nonalcoholic beverages also can be delivered.

As of Monday, Summit County has had two positive cases of COVID-19. The first is still in isolation in the Denver area. The second is in isolation in Frisco. Forty-seven Summit County residents and visitors have been tested. So far, 11 have tested negative, two have tested positive and 34 are still pending.

With the closures, Summit County joins a number of other communities around the country making changes to business practices in response to the disease, including statewide restaurant and bar closures in California, Illinois, Ohio and more. Breckenridge Town Manager Rick Holman noted that the county’s new restrictions were modeled after similar efforts in Gunnison and Crested Butte.

On Monday evening, Gov. Jared Polis announced a statewide ban on dine-in restaurants and bars.

More on COVID-19 The latest Summit County news, how to protect yourself and local resources.

The suspension in service will last for at least 30 days and will allow for takeout and delivery service. In addition to restaurants, large gathering areas like gyms, theaters and casinos also will be closed.

“There will be a time when we want to celebrate those local small businesses again,” Polis said. “… But I think you all know who are watching this that day is not today. It’s not tomorrow, and it’s not likely the week after.”

For business owners, even if the move seems to make sense, the news is still disappointing.

“You really can’t do social distancing in a restaurant,” said Jimmy Walker, head brewer at Breckenridge Brewery and Pub, which closed down preemptively Sunday because of the disease. “You’re touching too many credit cards and people and pens and money. You’re always close to people. …

“I finished the brew-day watching people make their way down the south end of Breckenridge, and it was heartbreaking to have to turn them all away. You think of all the visitors and people on vacation. We’re in the service industry, but we’re here to make people happy. It’s tough.”

GREELEY — Weld County declared an epidemic within its borders as the number of confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus increased, but didn’t outright prevent restaurants from seating diners.

In a notice Monday afternoon, Weld County public health director Mark Wallace ordered residents to practice social distancing, or staying at least six feet away from one another, and ordered all public events with 10 or more people to cancel. Events at schools, day-care centers, community recreation centers and libraries are also canceled.

The order is in effect until April 8. State health officials have confirmed five cases of the COVID-19 virus in Weld County as of Sunday afternoon.

Businesses were exempted from the order, but the department is urging restaurants to limit seating or become take-out only. That position is lighter than Denver’s all-out ban on dining in at restaurants for the next eight weeks.

Health department spokesman Eric Aakko told BizWest the county commissioners and authorities didn’t want to stop restaurants from seating customers if they can accommodate fewer than than 10 customers and provide the six feet of space.

He said the public is being asked to follow the orders on the honor system.

“If there is a large gathering we would be concerned and we would probably send a letter or something to that effect,” he said. “In events like this, it tends to be self-enforcing. People don’t want to be spreading disease unnecessarily.”

Aakko said the department can extend the order as it deems necessary.

Colorado,Yuma,43909.44931,https://www.yumapioneer.com/council-approved-emergency-declaration-tuesday-night/,Council approved emergency declaration Tuesday night – Yuma Pioneer,"The Yuma City Council approved an order declaring a local emergency in and for the City of Yuma, Tuesday night during its regular meeting at City Hall — just in case.

The Northeast Colorado Health Department then announced Wednesday morning confirmation of the first COVID-19 case in Yuma County.



The Yuma Municipal Code (Section 2.08.030) allows for the city council to declare a local emergency under certain circumstances. The the order approved by the council states that the COVID-19 pandemic is a local emergency as defined by the act.

City Manager Scott Moore stressed to the Pioneer that it does not mean Yuma has an emergency at this time. He said it means that with the declaration in place, if quarantine measures do have to be implemented in Yuma, another council meeting does not have to be called to enact the emergency declaration.

The city council is not going to have a meeting for the next three weeks, having canceled its regular meeting on April 7. That cancellation does not have to do with COVID-19, but rather is routinely done when a council meeting falls on the day of a municipal election. Normally, those meetings are rescheduled for the following Thursday. However, it appears there will not be much on the agenda anyway, so the council has canceled that meeting, with the next one set for April 21, at which point the new council will be sworn-in.



The local emergency declaration does activate another section of the municipal code, 2.08.040 (anyone can read the municipal code at the city of Yuma website, yumacolo.org.). It does grant the city manager the authority to approve contracts during the local emergency for up to $100,000, but that the contracts “are reasonably related to the local emergency.” The city manager also is to provide the city council a summary of all contracts approved, including the name of the contractors, the amount of the contract, and the purpose of the contract, on a daily basis.

It also opens the door to closing streets, sidewalks and parks and “to delineate areas within the City wherein an emergency exists.”

It also conceivably could result in the city ordering the closing of business establishments within the city for the period of the emergency. (The state of Colorado already has done this in regards to restaurants, bars and movie theaters.)

All of that and more is in the municipal code, but does not mean it all will be implemented, or that there will ever be a need to activate the emergency.

Also, the declaration is temporary, and would require council’s approval to extend it for a longer duration of time.

Councilman Dan Baucke voiced concerns over some of the language in the code, Tuesday night, but Mayor Ron Swehla said to trust the city manager.

“Our public health and safety officials are already fully mobilized and taking the necessary steps to protect West Hartford residents from the effects of COVID-19,” Cantor said. “This additional step is intended to reinforce the seriousness of the public health crisis, and to make sure town government has maximum flexibility and the authority to quickly respond as conditions change.”

Cantor said the goal is to ""spread out the inevitable infections so that the healthcare system isn't overwhelmed with patients.""

In declaring a state of emergency, Cantor is asking residents and businesses to take the following steps:

Families are asked to keep children at home.

Religious organizations are encouraged to conduct services virtually to reduce occupancy and create spacing between seating.

Businesses should require employees to work from home and consider staggering or reducing hours of operation.

Restaurants should cut occupancy by 50% to create adequate spacing between seating and encourage patrons to use take-out services instead of dining in.

Grocery stores should stop offering samples and shut down self-service stations.

Restaurants and establishments should cancel all gatherings, special events and celebrations.

All sports activities, including games and practices, should be cancelled.

Overnight on-street parking will be allowed in West Hartford from now until April 6. There is no need to apply for an omit during this time, according to police.",state_of_emergency,

New Haven health officials have also been notified of a second confirmed New Haven resident having COVID-19.

Here is is statement:

""Given the growing spread of this virus in our city, state, and country, I am declaring a state of emergency in the City of New Haven to protect the public health of our residents. There is no doubt that COVID-19 will continue to spread in our community, and I will take every measure appropriate to limit exposure to our residents. I have also made the decision to close City Hall to the public tomorrow, and indefinitely. We are curtailing all activities except critical functions until further notice. City employees that are not critical to operations will be notified that they should not report to work. Over the next several days, our team will be evaluating our employee safety and operations protocol, in addition to increasing options for teleworking where possible. If you are a member of the business community, I strongly encourage you to have only essential employees report to work, provide options for employees to telework and do what you can to support paid leave and reduce any chance of further spread of COVID-19.

As of this morning, we have a second confirmed case of COVID-19 and a third presumed case. The two New Haven residents had been exhibiting systems of COVID-19. Since they initially did not meet the CDC travel criteria, they were not tested but told by the New Haven Health Department to self-isolate as a precautionary measure. One of these two residents' symptoms worsened, and the individual admitted themselves to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where they were tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. The other individual is considered a presumptive case and has been hospitalized as of this afternoon, but we do not yet have laboratory confirmation of COVID-19. Both individuals will continue to be monitored by the New Haven Health Department, and we will continue to inform you of any updates regarding the situation.""",state_of_emergency,

PANAMA CITY — The Bay County Commission declared a state of emergency for the coronavirus on Tuesday despite there being no confirmed cases in the county.

RELATED: CLOSURES BAY AREA- Events, services, schools, canceled due to coronavirus concerns

County officials wanted to assure residents that the decision was for administrative purposes. The commission needs the declaration to seek Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reimbursement if there is an outbreak.

""An example I’ve used is if we had to send hundreds of employees home to work and we had to purchase laptops for those individuals, we can get reimbursed for those expenses,"" said Philip Griffitts, chairman of the commission. ""This is just kind of a protocol and paperwork trail we have to create early on.""

Mark Bowen, chief of Bay County emergency services, said the COVID-19 pandemic is reminiscent of the Ebola crisis that broke out several years ago. They were able to get equipment during that time and they haven’t had to use it yet, but they are prepared if they need to.

According to Bowen, the Emergency Operations Center has expended some funds for COVID-19, but nothing significant right now.

""It has been supplies and things of that nature and making sure the equipment we have is functional,"" Bowen said.

The main thing Bowen wants to stress to the public is if people are showing symptoms to call and not just show up to the emergency room.

""We got screening in place and 9-1-1 will ask travel questions, so that we think if somebody could have been exposed we can make sure EMS respond and police and fire stay outside,"" Bowen said. ""We want to limit the amount of healthcare workers that comes into contact with somebody that may have the virus.""

Griffitts explained that the county has been in a state of emergency since October of 2018 for Hurricane Michael and a lot of people don’t know that and the COVID-19 pandemic is no different. He also wants the public to not panic and keep doing what organizations like the Center of Disease Control (CDC) are telling the public to do.

While Griffitts doesn’t think they’ll have to send government officials home to work, they are prepared for it.

""We have folks that work for us who might have compromised immune systems, so we’re just working through those questions,"" Griffitts said. ""This is definitely a fluid situation and we’re just trying to figure it out as we go.""",state_of_emergency,174987

As cases of the coronavirus spread across Florida, Brevard County government officials declared a local state of emergency Saturday afternoon — a day after a national emergency was declared federally.

Brevard County Communications Director Don Walker emphasized that the emergency declaration approved unanimously by the county's Policy Group was a proactive measure, and was not triggered by any particular development locally.

""We don't want people to panic,"" Walker said. ""There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Brevard County. However, the emergency declaration gives the county additional operational flexibilities during this public health crisis, including the ability to expend additional funds in response to coronavirus.""

""If emergency needs arise, we are able to appropriate funds as needed,"" Walker said.

The emergency declaration also gives Brevard County access to Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements for coronavirus response efforts that might otherwise not be available.

There now are 70 reported cases of coronavirus infections in Florida, with four associated deaths. One of those deaths was a Floridian outside of the state at the time.

School closures, event cancellations and strong warnings to limit social contact all have been part of the major response locally to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in order to limit the number of people infected and the potential strain on the health care system.

The Brevard state of emergency declaration will allow for more streamlined government processes, should the virus severely impact the county.

Some of the advantages of having an emergency declaration are that it:

• Helps obtain necessary supplies quickly: Procurement policy may be waived to allow for timely access to personal protective equipment for first responders and sanitation supplies for critical public buildings, such as courthouses, the Brevard County Jail and the Brevard County Emergency Operations Center.

• Removes obstacles to a timely response: The county manager may be permitted to adjust leave policies and, if necessary, suspend union contracts in order to deal with a potential emergency.

• Provides timely access to financial resources by cutting red tape: Financial reserves may be accessed, as needed, to stage in anticipation of and, if necessary, respond to an emergency.

• In the event of a biological threat, reduces the threat of person-to-person transmission: Mass gatherings may be limited, as necessary and appropriate.

• Streamlines intergovernmental crisis management: Measures to better coordinate consequence management, in conjunction with Florida Department of Health and Brevard Public Schools, may be implemented.

• Better enables the county to seek federal reimbursement: The declaration of an emergency situates the county such that it may qualify for Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursement that might otherwise not be available.

Walker said the Policy Group met for about 35 minutes Saturday, and unanimously approved the emergency declaration. The panel includes the county manager, the county attorney, the County Commission chair, the county public safety director, the county emergency management director, the sheriff, the school superintendent and a representative of Brevard's municipalities.

Walker said neighboring Seminole and Volusia counties previously approved similar declarations.

Walker said the county is encouraging residents to follow proper hand-washing practices, to not go to work if they are sick, to practice ""social distancing"" and to consider steering clear of large gatherings.

""We're stressing prevention,"" Walker said.

But he added that county officials do not believe people need to stay cooped up in their homes if they are not sick, or to hoard large quantities of supplies such as water or toilet paper.

This was the first meeting of the Policy Group related to coronavirus.

But Walker said a separate task force of county officials has been discussing the issue regularly, planning county government response to coronavirus.

""We've been working on this pretty steadily in the last week or more,"" Walker said.

Walker said the county also continues to coordinate daily with the Florida Department of Health on the latest information regarding coronavirus.

Brevard residents can call 2-1-1 for up-to-date information between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

For calls after hours, contact the Florida Department of Health COVID-19 call center at 866-779-6121. The call center is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

The order took effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday.

Businesses that are deemed essential include grocery stores, farm and produce stands, gas stations, automobile dealerships, auto repair and auto supply stores, banks, hardware stores, shipping companies, media businesses and businesses that “provide food, shelter, social services or other necessities of life for economically disadvantaged or otherwise needy individuals,” the order stated.

Contractors and other tradesmen are also permitted to continue working throughout the county.

Businesses that are permitted to stay open are urged to continue practicing social distancing and take preventative measures issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said his deputies will be involved with enforcement measures by first educating non-compliant business owners before citing the problematic ones.

“This is truly a social responsibility where we all need to be involved,” he said.

Broward County, in partnership with the Florida Department of Health, has opened a temporary COVID-19 call center to assist in answering public questions about the coronavirus.

Call takers will also conduct over-the-phone pre-screening for testing eligibility.

Only those who fall into one of two groups qualify for testing: first responders, and people over the age of 65 who are displaying symptoms of COVID-19. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he hopes to expand testing to more people soon, but right now first responders are the top priority.

No. 2 - ""Non-essential"" businesses throughout Broward County were ordered to close, as the area has become the epicenter for the coronavirus pandemic in Florida with 217 cases reported as of Sunday evening.

The emergency order went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday morning, according to Broward County Mayor Dale V.C. Holness. Essential businesses, like grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations, banks and medical offices will remain open.

No. 3 - The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) said it has seen historic increases in unemployment applications, with more than 5,300 last week. That's over 400 more than the week before.

“We want people to apply (for unemployment) and realize we are going to use every tool available to help our citizens get through this crisis,” said DEO’s Executive Director Ken Lawson, adding many people who have been laid off or impacted by COVID-19 may qualify for benefits.

No. 4 - City officials have renewed Key West's state of emergency order for another seven days, adding new shutdown measures in light of the coronavirus outbreak in South Florida.

The move comes after 3 employees of a company that greets cruise ship passengers at Port Everglades tested positive for coronavirus

State health officials are urging anyone who recently traveled through Port Everglades to isolate themselves for 14 days if they start experiencing symptoms

Broward County declared a state of emergency after a fourth case of coronavirus was confirmed in the county, officials said Tuesday.

County Administrator Bertha Henry announced the emergency declaration at Tuesday morning's Broward commission meeting, saying it will make way for more resources to fight the spread of COVID-19.

State of Emergency declaration passes in @BrowardCounty for more resources as the county responds to a 4th case of #coronavirus. Watch @nbc6 pic.twitter.com/YdVQG7t7Lw — Arlene (@ArleneNBC6) March 10, 2020

The county's emergency operations center was activated to Level 2, meaning all lead emergency support teams would be notified but the emergency operation center would not be physically staffed, for now.

""They are aware they are doing it, they indicated to me whatever we need to the extent they have the ability to get it and expedite,"" Henry said.

The county has also formed a business team to address issues related to operations comprised of Port Everglades, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention & Visitors Bureau, and other high-impact business areas.

The move comes after three employees of a company that greets cruise ship passengers at Port Everglades tested positive for the new coronavirus, state health officials said. The company, Metro Cruise Services, said the employees provided embarkation services at various cruise terminals in Port Everglades.

The Florida Department of Health is urging anyone who recently traveled through Port Everglades to isolate themselves for 14 days if they start experiencing symptoms.

Officials confirmed the company connection in a news release that also said a 69-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 is the fourth Broward County resident, and third employee of Metro Cruise Services, to have the virus.

""We were unaware that any of our part-time employees were sick until we were notified by the authorities,” Metro Cruise Services President Anthony Newman said in a statement. ""We then immediately notified all of our Port Everglades employees that one of their associates had tested positive and advised them that, if they have any symptoms, they should seek medical assistance and not report to work.""

The health department advisory asks anyone who passed through the port in Fort Lauderdale to isolate themselves and contact their county health department or health care provider if they start experiencing symptoms of the virus, which includes a cough, fever and shortness of breath.

NBC 6 Investigator Tony Pipitone reports on the coronavirus' impact on the cruise industry.

That conforms with new guidelines issued Monday by the CDC, which advises recent cruise passengers to monitor their health for 14 days, immediately self-isolate if they experience symptoms, and contact medical professionals for treatment.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, but it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia in older adults and people with existing health problems. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus within weeks.

Swift-moving developments over the new coronavirus ricocheted across Florida’s Capitol as Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency Monday and lawmakers disrupted their legislative session so crews in surgical gowns could swab down the House chambers. DeSantis said his declaration would enable Florida to better marshal resources and get outside help as it confronts the growing public health crisis.

Florida Department of Health

""That allows us to create a unified command structure, it also allows, if need be, out-of-state medical personnel to operate in Florida,"" DeSantis said at a news conference Monday evening. ""It allows us to more swiftly purchase any necessary supplies including masks and materials and equipment necessary to set up field hospitals. It allows pharmacists to dispense up to 30-day emergency prescription refill of maintenance medication.""

Health officials are trying to connect with all employees of Metro Cruise Services who may have come into contact with the three infected co-workers. The agency announced earlier that three Broward County men, ages 65, 67 and 75, had tested positive; the news release didn't specify which of these men are the other two company employees.

Two cruise ships that left from Fort Lauderdale — the Regal Princess and the Caribbean Princess — were later issued “no sail"" orders by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after crew members who had possibly been exposed on a California ship were tested.

The Regal Princess eventually docked at the port late Sunday and passengers were able to leave the ship. The Caribbean Princess stopped briefly in Grand Cayman on Monday to pick up test kits for two crew members. The ship is sailing off Florida's coast until it gets the all clear.

Also, late Monday, state health officials reported that a 60-year-old Volusia County woman tested positive, bringing the state's total to 20. Of those, two people have died. Fourteen of the 20 cases were diagnosed in Florida and five in another state, officials said. In addition, a California resident, now under self-isolation in Florida, has tested positive.

Collier County commissioners declared a state of emergency Monday as the novel coronavirus continues to spread, joining a growing list of local governments in Florida.

County commissioners held an emergency special meeting at the commission chambers to discuss responses to COVID-19 and receive an update from county officials about the current situation in Collier.

A local state of emergency gives county officials the emergency powers to shut down facilities such as libraries or beaches if it becomes necessary, said County Attorney Jeffrey Klatzkow.

""This gives us the emergency powers to do whatever we need to do for public health and safety,"" he said. ""And it's going to be consistent with what the feds and the state guidance is going to be.""

Among other things, Collier will shut down league play, for things like Little League, at county facilities; cancel, postpone or limit county programs with more than 50 participants; and scrap non-essential meetings, such as advisory committee, planning commission or neighborhood informational meetings.

""I'd rather be wrong on the side of being a little overly restrictive than being wrong on the side of not being restrictive enough,"" Commission Chairman Burt Saunders said.

Commissioners, spreading out on the dais to practice much-publicized social distancing, also gave the county manager the authority to order closures of high risk public facilities, such as gymnasiums and fitness centers.

County Manager Leo Ochs said after the meeting that such a determination would be made on a ""case-by-case basis,"" assessing their level of potential risk.

At fitness centers, for instance, it can be difficult to keep the equipment sanitized at all times, Ochs said.

""This will be very limited, but I just wanted the authority in the event that I thought it was necessary,"" he said, adding that there is no list currently or any specific location that the county is looking to close.

As of Monday afternoon, Collier had six people who tested positive for the virus. The county had its first confirmed cases March 10.

The Collier cases include a 73-year-old man, a 68-year-old woman, a 64-year-old woman, a 76-year-old man, a 28-year-old man and a woman whose age was not released.

Stephanie Vick, administrator of the Florida Department of Health in Collier County, told commissioners during a presentation that the county still doesn't qualify and classify as ""widespread community transmission.""

""Which is a good thing, but it can give you a false sense of security, because we're only testing those that meet the criteria at the highest risk,"" she said.

Vick said testing supplies are running low. Collier's health department ""scrounged"" and went to the health department in Pinellas County, which helped Collier with 25 tests, she said.

Other supplies are becoming scarce too, including face shields, Vick said.

""We have very little left,"" she said, adding that those have been requested from the state.

Miami, Miami-Dade County and Key West, among others, have already declared local states of emergency due to COVID-19.

Escambia County declared a local state of emergency Monday afternoon as both the county and city of Pensacola cancel all publicly permitted events with more than 50 people in response to the coronavirus.

The declaration came shortly before the Department of Health announced Escambia County had its first positive coronavirus case. Neighboring Santa Rosa County had its first last week.

On top of permitted events, Pensacola also canceled all facility reservations and rentals with more than 50 people.

Officials will reassess the situation in eight weeks following the guidelines issued from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The county also activated its Emergency Operations Center on Monday afternoon.

""We are proactively activating the EOC and declaring a local state of emergency to ensure we have the appropriate resources for this unprecedented event, "" Escambia County Emergency Manager Eric Gilmore said in a county press release. ""We encourage the public to follow CDC guidance for social distancing and proper health and hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Escambia County.""

On top of events that have already been canceled, the city's planned Census 2020 Kick-Off Event on Wednesday and AARP tax-aide services at the Pensacola Library, Molino Branch Library and Southwest Branch Library have been canceled.

City parks will remain open, but all programs are being suspended, with the exception of the city's spring break programs for school-aged children and senior citizen meal program done in partnership with the Council on Aging of West Florida. City community centers will be closed to the public.

The county's community centers remain open at this point, but the county will likely be closing them soon, county spokeswoman Laura Coale said Monday.

The city is working with the Council on Aging to transition the senior meal program to some type of take-out or home delivery system.

Later in the day, the CDC issued another revision to its guidelines and called for communities to limit gatherings of people to 10 or less.

Escambia County Administrator Janice Gilley told the News Journal she would have to speak with commissioners to decide how the county would respond.

""This is a very fluid incident,"" Gilley said. ""And so I think it would be very difficult to make any definitive statements at this moment, because as you saw today, we went from 50 before 8 a.m., to the president speaking about 10 in a gathering at 2:30 pm. So, I don't want to make a definitive statement about that yet until we can have a chance to see what the impact is in Escambia County.""

Robinson said at this time, he would not be ordering any restaurants or other businesses to close, but said that could change, especially if the Pensacola area sees community spread of the coronavirus.

""Community spread is important,"" Robinson said. ""Obviously, if we get to that point, it'll change what we end up doing. But at this point, we do not see community spread. So, the things we're implementing in the way we go about, day to day, in Escambia County, at this point is because of that. If things change, we will change, and we will probably institute new policies.""

In addition to the Escambia County case announced Monday afternoon, the Florida Department of Health announced four new cases of the virus in the state, bringing the total number of cases in Florida to 159. So far, four people have died in Florida due to the coronavirus, including a man in Santa Rosa .

Until Monday, it was difficult to get a coronavirus test in the area, with local doctors advising patients with symptoms to stay home and self-quarantine as a test was not available.

The first drive-thru testing clinic was opened Monday and the Ascension Sacred Heart call center received 211 calls by 10:30 a.m. Monday and directed 51 people to get the test in just 90 minutes after pre-screening their symptoms.

During his morning press conference, Robinson said he believes there are probably people in the community who have the virus and are not showing symptoms, but defended his position of not taking further action until there was community spread of the virus.

""We haven't gotten to that stage at this particular time,"" Robinson said. ""Again, other communities, both within the United States and the state of Florida are already there. We are not there. That doesn't say we won't get there. But we are positioning ourselves with certain thresholds. When we hit those thresholds, we will institute new policies.""

Although there were no cases yet confirmed, Robinson said small businesses, especially restaurant owners, should begin planning for the worst.

""If we reach a certain impact, I would tell restaurants to begin to think how they can either provide food for delivery or take-out in the event that something does happen with community spread,"" Robinson said. ""Again, anything can change, and we will change with the circumstances.""

Robinson said he would be drafting a letter to the state and the federal government requesting a financial assistance program for workers who miss out on work because of closures related to the coronavirus.

""Even though there'll be this period of slowdown, we want them to be able to keep their job as best they can,"" Robinson said.

Florida,Flagler,43906.80208,https://www.palmcoastobserver.com/article/flagler-county-declares-local-state-of-emergency-for-covid-19-urges-residents-to-avoid-gatherings,"Flagler County declares local state of emergency for COVID-19, urges residents to avoid gatherings","Although Flagler County had no known cases of COVID-19 coronavirus when County Commissioners held their regular meeting March 16, commissioners voted unanimously to declare a state of local emergency and urged residents to avoid large gatherings.

""The key is social distancing."" — JONATHAN LORD, Flagler County Emergency Management director

County Emergency Management Director Jonathan Lord told the commission that President Donald Trump had recently advised people to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. The number of people that authorities are saying constitutes too many has changed rapidly — an example of how quickly recommended responses to the virus have shifted.

""Something I’ve told you is probably wrong by now because things are changing so quickly,"" Lord said toward the end of his presentation.

""This time last week, the guidance was mass gatherings of more than a 1,000 should not occur,"" Lord said. ""This weekend it became 250, as of the president on the news an hour ago, it is down to 10. ... He really wants people to stay home. He’s saying avoid bars, food courts, restaurants.""

And that doesn't just go for people who feel sick: People can contract COVID-19 and remain asymptomatic — showing no symptoms — all the while passing the disease to others. So it helps slow the disease's transmission if even people who feel healthy avoid unnecessary gatherings.

Also over the weekend, Florida Department of Health-Flagler County Administrator Bob Snyder told the commission, the number of known cases in Florida jumped from 42 to 137; as of the evening of March 16, it was 142.

But, Snyder said, ""I feel like this weekend was pivotal,"" because in the county and local cities, he said, ""actions have been taken to cancel small or large gatherings.""

""That’s what mitigation is all about,"" Snyder said. ""If that continues, I think we have a high, high chance ... that we’ll be successful in watching this virus die. ... We’ve got to keep that up, and encourage that in addition to everyday good hygiene.""

Still, he said, ""At some point in time, we will have our first confirmed case of COVID-19. When? Don’t know.""

But the state will soon — likely by the end of the week — have the capacity to test as many as 625,000 people, he said, with assistance from LabCorps, Quest, various other private testing labs and AdventHealth's lab in Orlando.

""We know what to do. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we’ll be on it."" — BOB SNYDER, Florida Department of Health-Flagler administrator

That will likely mean an uptick in known positive cases.

Once there's a positive case in Flagler County, the health department will take the lead: Its nurses will interview the patient to determine who they've been in contact with over the 14-day period in which they may have contracted or been shedding the virus, and will then contact those people to see if they're sick and who they've been in contact with.

That process is called ""contact tracing,"" and the health department is accustomed to using it for other illnesses, such as HIV.

""I want our community to know, we know what to do,"" Snyder said. ""We are used to doing this. ... Once we do start to see cases in Flagler, we’ll be on it.""

Lord and Snyder have will also hold a phone meeting with assisted living facilities and nursing homes later this week, Lord said, as seniors are at heightened risk from the disease. The facilities have already started reducing visits, Snyder said.

The county is also shutting down nonessential services, such as the county library, while working to provide help to people who had relied on county services that are being reduced or shut down — for instance, the county's adult daycare program, or meals provided at the Wickline Center (which are now being delivered to individuals' homes). The virus could still be circulating as late as July or August, Lord said, citing the president's televised speech.

Although residents should be prepared, Lord said, it's unhelpful to hoard supplies.

""People should be prepared and stocking up, but the whole hoarding three years' of toilet paper, whatever motivates people to do that, this is not the time to do that,"" he said.

For people who become sick with COVID-19 and have to self-isolate, Lord said, ""We can fill in that gap to get people toiletries and meals if they’re locked in.""",state_of_emergency,99956

Lee County commissioners adopted a state of local emergency Tuesday, while simultaneously announcing the closing of many busy county facilities to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

The message from government and public safety officials is for people to conform with instructions for social distancing, working from home if possible and avoiding locations that are typically crowded.

Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Lee County stood at 5 as of noon Tuesday although two people died while at Gulf Coast early this month.

The local state of emergency was imposed mainly to make sure the county is eligible for federal disaster funds available due to President Trump's declaration of a state of national emergency.

“We are starting to incur costs as are many counties,” County Manager Roger Desjarlais told county commissioners at a Tuesday morning meeting. “The federal declaration of emergency makes available reimbursement funds; in order to be eligible for those funds we have to declare a state of emergency.”

An early cost from the crisis started to build with the opening of the county Emergency Operations Center on Ortiz Boulevard in Fort Myers on Friday. Some 70 people from county governments and outside agencies.

Most county activities that have been closed are places where individuals can gather in relatively close company. Most outdoor venues will remain open.

The county will conform with an executive order that bars and nightclubs be closed as of 5 p.m. Tuesday and limits restaurants to 50 percent of capacity, with six-foot separation on tables and capacity limited to half of the restaurant's normal capacity.

Sheriff Carmine Marceno told reporters at a news conference that the definitions of bar and restaurant are based on the percentage of total sales that are in food and other factors .

Lee County libraries closed at the end of the business day on Tuesday. They will remain closed for 30 days.

Toll collections on county bridges will be completely automated. County Manager Roger Desjarlais told county commissioners that the toll collections would be automatic, Drivers Leeway or SunPass transponders will have the tolls deducted form their accounts. Plate readers will read license tags and send a bill for the toll. The administrative fee normally charged will be waived.

Lee County parks and beaches will remain open, the county is urging people not to congregate in groups of 10 or more on the beaches.

County dog parks will closed as will animal services clinics Only a skeleton crew will be working the shelters to clean and feed the animals.

LeeTran buses continue to operate; bus drivers have been equipped with hand sanitizers and wipes to keep germs such as the coronavirus at bay.

Commission Chair Brian Hamman said reports on the LeeTran routes reveals that ridership has been down since people were urged to stay home if possible

County hearing examiner proceedings have been canceled for the next 30 days, so any scheduled hearing on proposed construction projects will be rescheduled. County permitting offices will remain open.

The county human services agency will close its lobby and serve clients online or by telephone, and county utilities will take payments only at its drive-up window and at drop boxes at the utilities offices and the city public works department.

Closures: Here's what is closed or has changed amid COVID-19 concerns

The county's law enforcement agency is also taking steps to limit spread of the virus.

Lee County jails have made plans for quarantine if it becomes necessary to isolate inmates who may have been close to the coronavirus.

Marceno said non-essential inmate movement within the jails have been reduced or stopped. Large internal staff meetings at the sheriff's office have been suspended and internal special training has been halted.

Transportation of inmates has been reduced.

Court appearances have been reduced and will be conducted with court video technology as much as possible. Video visits with inmates will be conducted only from remote locations, Marceno said.

The emergency declaration gives the county manager the authority to take a wide range of actions immediately if necessary, but county officials say it will be used sparingly.

“That’s not something we do in a vacuum or take it lightly,” said Desjarlais. “Any action we do take, we will let you know as soon as possible.”

Garbage collection will continue and public transit will continue to operate. The county's Passport transportation service for people with disabilities or facing medically critical issues will also continue.

In the city of Fort Myers, where a state of emergency took effect automatically on the county's declaration there have been cancellations, facility closures and service modifications affecting city programs and services, effective Wednesday.

All city public meetings are suspended. City parks will remain open, although programs have been suspended. The lobby of the utility billing center will be closed until further notice. The drive-thru window will be open to conduct customer transactions. Drop box payments are being accepted at the Utility Billing Center.

Also closed are city pools, the racquet club, Skatium and volleyball complex.

Lee Health erected a tent Tuesday outside the emergency room at Lee Memorial Hospital for separate triage of patients for coronavirus from other patients.

By the end of the week tents will go up at all ER locations, according to Dr. Larry Antonucci, president and CEO of Lee Health.

Hospital volunteers are also being notified their assistance is on hold, particularly since many volunteers are retirees and susceptible to the virus and especially if they have underlying health conditions.

“We have temporarily suspended our volunteer program to mitigate risk of community spread,” he said.

Lee Health’s wellness centers are being closed and health-related classes are being cancelled.

Some Lee Health employees have expressed concerns that Lee Health has not chosen to restrict all visitors similar to the NCH Healthcare System except at end of life circumstances, according to emails.

“We have a very strict visitation policy and are screening everybody at our entrances,” Briggs said. “We are screening for travel, symptoms and potential exposure.”

Earlier in the week, 55 Lee Health employees were quarantined at home because of contacts to patients with COVID-19 and 33 of them exhibited symptoms. Now 60 employees remain in isolation.

Test results have been negative and 21 test results for employees are pending, Antonucci said.

March 16, 2020

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) -- Leon County has declared a local state of emergency to further prepare and respond to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.

The county announced the state of emergency Monday afternoon.

""Life after the state of emergency declaration is not different than before,"" said Leon County Commission Chairman Bryan Desloge. ""We can still enjoy our community, but responsibly and with good hygiene in mind. However, the declaration does give our County the tools necessary to respond quickly and effectively to an unprecedented event like the COVID-19 global pandemic.""

The county says the state of emergency was triggered not by a specific development, but in an abundance of caution to ensure the community's strongest public health response.

""Through a state of emergency, if needed, our County can more easily request critical healthcare supplies, food supplies to feed our schoolchildren, and step up response efforts whenever and wherever needed,"" said Leon County Administrator Vincent S. Long. ""Like during hurricanes, a declaration positions us to get support and provide aid that mitigates the spread of the coronavirus.""

Manatee County commissioners are expected to declare a local state of emergency on Monday.

If commissioners approve the emergency declaration, it would give Manatee County access to Federal Emergency Management Agency reimbursements for coronavirus-related response efforts, allowing the school district and other county municipalities to access emergency funds.

As of Sunday evening, four Manatee County residents have a presumed positive test result or a confirmed case of coronavirus.

A 67-year-old Manatee County woman showed severe respiratory symptoms and was ""presumptively positive"" for the novel coronavirus, Sarasota Memorial Hospital announced late Friday night. The patient was placed under the care of staff trained in infection prevention and control measures.

A 62-year-old Manatee County resident also tested positive for COVID-19 and was placed in isolation. This is not a travel-related case, the state health officials say.

The county commission meeting will be held Monday at 1:30 p.m. in the County Administration Building at 1112 Manatee Ave. W.

All malls and casinos will have to shut down. Construction sites, hotels and banks can remain open.

Medical facilities, grocery stores, gas stations and restaurant kitchens can stay open for pick-up and delivery. The announcement is effective Thursday at 9 p.m.

Gimenez ordered all non-essential businesses to close, including: art supply stores, craft supply stores, barbers, beauty salons, nail studios, bookstores, casinos, including Calder, Casino Miami, Magic City and Hialeah Park, clothing stores, indoor amusement parks, trampoline parks, driving ranges, jewelry stores, malls, music supply stores, pawn shops, social clubs, tennis clubs, golf courses, fishing charters, souvenir stores, spas, sporting goods stores, tutoring centers, music classes, toy stores and children’s stores.

Essential businesses that will be allowed to stay open include: architectural, engineering and landscape services, assisted living facilities (ALFs), nursing homes, adult day care centers and senior residential facilities, banks, childcare facilities with limits of 10 children and adults in a group, convenience stores, factories, manufacturing facilities, bottling plants and other industrial sites, gas stations, grocery stores, hotels, hardware stores, home-based care for seniors, adults or children, landscaping and pool services, laundromats, logistics providers, mail and shipping services, natural and propane gas providers, pet supply stores, pharmacies, professional services, and restaurant kitchens for pick-up and delivery only.

Waste management services, telecommunications providers, media services, taxis and private transportation providers, food cultivation, and services providing food, shelter and other services for the economically disadvantaged can also stay open. Any business operating solely through electronic or telephonic means, and businesses at airports, seaports and other government facilities, can stay open as well.

Across South Florida, from Miami-Dade County to Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, counties and cities enacted emergency measures this week to shut down restaurants, bars, nightclubs, movie theaters, gyms and other entertainment-type venues to help prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The mass closures of such businesses, especially restaurants and bars, will be devastating for the industry, experts say. Retail and office tenants are expected to ask their landlords for rent breaks as their April 1 payment due date approaches.

Malls in South Florida, such as Bal Harbour Shops, Brickell City Centre, Aventura Mall and all Simon-owned properties, had already announced they planned to close before Gimenez’s announcement. Major retailers such as Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s had also stated they were closing.

All parks and beaches in Miami-Dade were instructed to close as of Thursday morning, the mayor said in his daily webcast.

Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said in a statement Thursday he was taking “preemptive steps” to limit the possible spread of the virus, also known as COVID-19.

“Although we do not have community spread at this time, we want to take the preemptive steps to keep it that way,” Gimenez said in a statement on his website.” “Therefore, I have decided to suspend the operation of the Miami-Dade County Youth Fair, the Miami Open tennis tournament, the MIA 5K run, and all major events at the American Airlines Arena.”

He continued: “The March 22 NASCAR race at the Homestead Miami Speedway is postponed at this time. NASCAR officials will decide whether or not to hold the race without fans.”

There have been more than 124,500 coronavirus cases worldwide since it was first detected in Wuhan, China late last year.

As of Thursday morning, the United States has seen more than 1,300 confirmed cases of coronavirus in 44 states plus Washington, D.C. In Florida, there have been at least 26 cases with two confirmed deaths.

On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a “global pandemic.”

“As we move forward together during this time, we will continue to monitor what the World has determined is a global pandemic,” Gimenez continued. “We will constantly evaluate planned mass gatherings as the situation evolves.”

SHALIMAR — Social distancing is the only tool that local government officials have to blunt the impact of the coronavirus, Karen Chapman, director of the Okaloosa County Department of Health, told the County Commission Tuesday.

""If we don’t blunt it, we will overwhelm our medical system, and people are going to die,"" Chapman said while speaking to the board via a speaker phone.

Later in the meeting, the commission unanimously agreed to declare a local state of emergency to help protect residents and visitors from the coronavirus.

Earlier Tuesday, the state DOH confirmed a second case of COVID-19 in Okaloosa County. Like the first case, the second confirmed case is a woman in the age range of 61 to 78 and is travel-related.

RELATED: TRACK THE CORONAVIRUS: Interactive map from FDOH with updates and places

Declaring the local state of emergency will allow the commission to act with ""a little more nimbleness"" to help protect people in Okaloosa County, county Public Safety Director Patrick Maddox told the board.

The commission took several state-of-emergency-like steps Tuesday before approving the actual declaration of a state of emergency.

For example, the board agreed to close the public lobbies of the county water and sewer offices and county visitors’ centers until further notice.

Permits for events of 10 or more people were revoked until the end of April. No new permits of this kind will be issued until further notice.

Also, all non-essential county committee/board meetings were canceled for up to 30 days from Tuesday.

To stay updated and provide public guidance on coronavirus issues, the commission will hold emergency meetings at 8:30 a.m. March 24 and 31 in the County Administration Building in Shalimar.

During Tuesday’s commission meeting, Commissioner Carolyn Ketchel practiced social distancing by sitting next to one end of the dais rather than in her normal spot behind the dais.

Ketchel said she had just learned that a 34-year-old female friend of hers in Washington D.C. is ""extremely sick"" with the coronavirus. She also noted that the White House on Monday had released nationwide guidelines that recommend Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.

In response to a question from Commissioner Graham Fountain, Chapman said there currently is no specific answer to how long the virus threat will last.

""Right now, we’re looking at periods of two months at a time,"" she said. ""The (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is recommending gatherings of 50 or more to be canceled for at least the next six to eight weeks.

""We know so little about this virus, and so little about its patterns. Could it last until August? It could. If we don’t take some action now, we will prolong it at our local level.""

Before the board approved various state of emergency measures, Commissioner Nathan Boyles had asked Chapman if she had any specific recommendations the commission should take to protect the public against the virus.

""Think of this as a Category 5 hurricane coming at you,"" she said. ""This is an invisible virus coming at us. If it comes in and starts spreading, it will overwhelm our medical system.""

She added that the actions of social distancing ""may be pooh-poohed"" currently, but they are necessary.

""There has not been enough testing to know if (the virus is) spreading,"" in Florida, Chapman said. ""At minimum, I would take actions to minimize actions to limit social interactions in our community. We’ll reassess this on a weekly basis.""",state_of_emergency,193811

NEW PORT RICHEY — Pasco County declared a local state of emergency Thursday morning, giving broad powers to its administrative staff to maintain public health in the wake of a Land O’ Lakes man contracting the coronavirus.

The declaration, approved by county commissioners in an emergency meeting, came at the request of the state Division of Emergency Management. It allows County Administrator Dan Biles and Emergency Management director Andrew Fossa to waive normal procedures to do what is considered necessary, including ordering curfews, to aid the state Department of Health during the outbreak.

The emergency declaration allows Biles and Fossa to waive purchasing procedures and other protocols related to performing public work, make emergency purchases, hire workers, make use of volunteers or other considerations. The county last declared a state of emergency in August in advance of Hurricane Dorian.

The declaration is in effect for seven days, but can be extended at the discretion of Biles or Foss.

With the Centers for Disease Control ""predicting that it is ‘likely’ that ‘widespread transmission’'' of coronavirus will occur in the United States, the resolution also urged local residents to follow the agency’s practical measures on hand washing, staying home when ill and other safeguards.

Earlier, Kurt Scheible, Pasco’s public transportation director, said county bus drivers have been given disinfectant wipes to clean steering wheels, fare boxes and the metal hand rails that riders use to board buses. Hand sanitizer always has been available on board for riders, he said.

In east Pasco, Saint Leo University said students, now on spring break, are being instructed to not return to the residential campus. Online classes will begin March 23.

Saint Leo education center students at Tampa (Channelside); MacDill Air Force Base; Lakeland; and the university’s sites on Pasco-Hernando State College campuses in New Port Richey, Spring Hill and Brooksville will begin online classes March 16.

A spokeswoman for PHSC, which is on spring break, said it is adhering to its normal schedule, as of Thursday afternoon.

Saint Leo University also canceled all large group events and suspended indefinitely off-season sports activities for fall and winter sports. Spring sports are continuing but no fans will be permitted to attend acrobatics and tumbling home events.

Pasco Tax Collector Mike Fasano said his office planned to send letters to motorists with birthdays in April and May. urging them to renew their motor vehicle tags and drivers licenses online or through the U.S. mail, if possible, rather than visiting one of his offices.

An earlier version of this story reported Saint Leo University had suspended all sports events indefinitely, but the suspension applies only to off-season activities for fall and winter sports.

BARTOW — The Polk County Commission on Tuesday unanimously approved County Manager Bill Beasley’s request to declare a local emergency to cope with the fast-moving COVID-19 crisis.

The vote came the day after Beasley announced closings of several county facilities. Beasley also told commissioners he was considering furloughing some county employees to limit the potential for the spread of the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19.

“I believe these are trying times that demand challenging and unique solutions,” Beasley told commissioners. “This is a dynamic situation. It seems to be changing daily, sometimes hourly.”

Beasley announced the following closings of county facilities beginning Wednesday for a period of 30 days:

• All five community resource centers

• Both Adult Day Healthcare centers

• The Stuart Conference Center and other public meeting rooms at the county Agriculture Center in Bartow

• The exhibit hall and conference center at the Circle B Bar Reserve in Lakeland

The park and trails at Circle B will remain open to the public as will all other public trails and parks across the county, Beasley said.

In addition, the Rohr Home, a nursing facility, will be closed to visitors and new patients, he said.

Polk County Utilities will not disconnect service or charge its roughly 68,000 water and sewer customers late fees on overdue payments for the next 60 days, Beasley said.

All county offices will be open, although some with reduced staff, he said.

The exception is the offices of Polk County Property Appraiser Marsha Faux, who announced earlier she was shutting down to promote the social distancing recommended by state and federal health officials. The announcement on the Appraiser’s Office website did not say when it would re-open.

People can still do business with the Property Appraiser’s Office through the website, phone or regular mail and email, the announcement said.

Beasley also told commissioners he is considering a short-term “draw down” of the county’s roughly 1,850-person workforce as part of the county’s COVID-19 action plan.

After the meeting, Beasley told The Ledger he may consider putting some employees on a furlough for a period of time to reduce the number of person-to-person contacts that could spread the virus.

See The Ledger’s complete coverage of coronavirus

“The bottom line is the less contact we have with each other, the less opportunity for this to spread,” commission Chairman Bill Braswell said.

The furloughed workers would be told not to report to work and would be given some kind of compensation, said Beasley, who declined to discuss details.

The county manager said he has no idea how many, if any, county workers might be furloughed.

Beasley has asked top county managers to give him a list of employees who can work remotely from home, he said. Not until he gets that list later this week will he decide on furloughs.

The local emergency declaration allows Beasley to act on matters that would normally require county commission approval, County Attorney Michael Craig said. That includes purchasing decisions and providing emergency residential facilities and warehousing.

The emergency period can last only seven days but can be extended repeatedly by the county manager, he said.

“It’s anticipated it will need to be extended multiple times,” Craig said.

The extensions are subject to commission approval at its next regular meeting, Beasley said.

In other business, the commission approved extending its annual property insurance coverage for another year at $1.8 million, a roughly 6% increase over the current policy. It will cover all county buildings, which are valued at $850 million, said Mark Thomas, the county’s risk manager.

The insurance plan coverage was scheduled to increase 10% to $1.9 million, but the county reduced some coverage limits in line with neighboring counties and cities, Thomas said.

Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Rick Scott, of Florida, urged drastic action in an interview with CNN on Thursday.

""I think they ought to do everything they can to stop people from being on the beach,"" he said. ""They ought to make sure that the only way you can go on the beach is if you're going to be on there by yourself.""

He also urged people to take personal responsibility for themselves and their families and not go onto beaches in groups. Doing so means possibly being exposed to people with the coronavirus and then possibly exposing one’s own family.

""The federal government only can do so many things,"" he said. ""If we don’t take individual responsibility, this is going to be so much worse and we’re going to lose many more of our loved ones.""

On Tuesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis ordered a limit of 10 people at beach gatherings, and he closed bars and restricted restaurant occupancy to 50%.

St. Johns County has not shut down beaches or restricted access.

More officers with the St. Johns County Sheriff’s Office are patrolling the beaches as part of normal spring break protocol, said Sheriff’s Office spokesman Chuck Mulligan.

The focus is on educating people who aren’t following the governor’s order, he said.

While officers have enforcement tools available to see to it that the governor’s order is obeyed, the goal for the Sheriff’s Office is for people to be able to go on about their lives and use best practices, Mulligan said.

""We’re going to go forward using discretion, but we’ll encourage people to use best practices to curtail coronavirus. ... Our goal is not to criminally charge people unnecessarily,"" Mulligan said.

St. Augustine Beach Police Department Chief Robert Hardwick said that Beach police are working with other county agencies on the response to the coronavirus.

Beach police are responding to calls for service on the beach. If officers see a family with several people, they aren’t intervening, he said.

But if there’s a call for service about a large group, officers are just educating them on the executive order, Hardwick said. The Beach has not made an arrest related to violation of the governor’s order about social distancing at the beach.

The city has been seeing some minor incidents, such as traffic issues and arguments, with people under 18 from Putnam County who are on spring break.

The Putnam County Sheriff’s Office plans to send officers to help St. Augustine Beach because of that, Hardwick said.

As for business on the beach, Hardwick said St. Augustine Beach technically doesn’t have bars. But there are restaurants that serve alcohol, according to state standards based on the volume of food versus alcohol sales, he said.

The city hasn’t ordered any businesses to stop serving alcohol, he said.

St. Augustine Beach hasn’t seen extra issues with alcohol being served, and the dynamic at the beach is different than in the city of St. Augustine, Hardwick said. St. Augustine ordered restaurants to stop serving alcohol temporarily.

Hardwick and Cmdr. Thomas Ashlock have visited all of the restaurants in the city and provided them a copy of DeSantis’ order and information on how to comply with new guidelines for restaurants.

Most of the restaurants were already in compliance, and some are taking extra steps to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, he said.

The state of emergency is in effect for seven days and can be renewed by another vote of the board of commissioners.

“Right now, there isn’t anything specific that we’re asking the board,” said County Administrator Bradley Arnold. “The state is directing us to remain focused on any (task) where we have the authority.”

He said the emergency status allows the county to respond quickly to direction from the state and federal government.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has asked restaurants to reduce capacity in half and the federal government has recommended that people avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.

Arnold said the directives cause a problem with the board’s next regular meeting scheduled for March 24. He said the 250-person capacity of the meeting room at the Everglades Recreation Center can be cut at least in half by setting up chairs farther apart.

But the county may not be able to further limit the number of people attending a public hearing. Teleconferencing is permitted for state agencies, but not for local governments, Arnold said.

“Would the governor consider waiving that provision?” he asked.

Arnold recommended going ahead with the March 24 meeting. The agenda includes a woman who seeks a zoning change for her mobile home and possible action on a drainage issue on SE 25th Street.

“It sounds like we have a fair amount of county business to discuss,” said Chairman Steve Printz. “It seems like we ought to get it done while we can.”

The county offers a great number of consolidated services for cities, including emergency dispatching and fire services, and Printz said that helps in responding to emergency situations like the Coronavirus.

“When you’re in an emergency, it’s too late (to consolidate),” he said.

CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. (WCTV) — Wakulla County declared a local state of emergency Tuesday due to coronavirus.

Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Florida on Monday, March 9, so the state can more rapidly respond to the coronavirus pandemic.

“Even though there have not been any confirmed cases in Wakulla County, it is our duty to take proactive measures for our Community,"" said County Administrator David Edwards. ""This declaration provides a method to take prudent action as necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the County, and will allow the County to seek reimbursement from the federal government.""

Chairman Mike Stewart said the declaration is about keeping the county prepared to respond to coronavirus.

“This declaration is not meant to alarm anyone, and we expect life to be as normal as before. We are doing this in an abundance of caution, and this is to allow our County to have the means to respond to this unfortunate event,"" said Stewart.

The move is designed to limit large gatherings in the county, and also to limit contact between county government personnel and the public, as COVID-19 continues to pose a threat to public health.

RELATED: CORONAVIRUS NWF - What’s open & what’s not? - A list of closures and what is still open

The special called meeting only tangentially included any mention of the young spring break crowds now descending on the area. That reference came in a short statement from District 1 Commissioner Bill Chapman, currently chairman of the board of county commissioners.

""We would ask the board to recommend to all citizens and visitors and businesses to follow the directives and recommendations as set forth by the Centers for Disease Control (the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, whose guidance has included limiting public gatherings to less than 50 people, along with urging sick people to stay home),"" Chapman said.

Specifically, the local state of emergency cancels and suspends all events conducted under terms of county permits, and does the same with special events being conducted under the county’s beach activities ordinance.

Monday’s vote also suspends rental of all county facilities, suspends driving on the beach permits until Aug. 1, with a new lottery for those permits beginning on June 1, and extends dog on the beach permits for eight weeks, with no new permit applications accepted until June 1.

""Our idea is to minimize the contact between the public and staff the best we can,"" Walton County Administrator Larry Jones told commissioners prior to the vote.

""We want to serve the public,"" Jones continued. ""We want to make sure we take care of their needs. We believe most of these things are issues that will provide some protections to our county staff and citizens.""

The emergency declaration also moves a number of previously scheduled county government planning meetings, and cancels all meetings of volunteer boards and committees until May 1.

The scheduling of county commission meetings wasn’t specifically addressed in connection with the emergency declaration, although some commissioners did wonder about potential problems with commission meetings that might attract more than 50 people.

The emergency declaration has to be revisited every seven days, according to information from the Monday meeting, with either the chairman, the commission or the county administrator making decisions on its continuance.

In addition to the emergency declaration, the county will allow employees who can work from home to do so ""to provide that safety for our staff and our visitors,"" Jones said.

In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Kelly Girtz scheduled an emergency meeting of the mayor and commission for Monday evening to approve a state of emergency for the city and to discuss a 7 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. The city’s government previously said it would be from 9 p.m. to 5 a.m., but a later tweet corrected the time span.



UPDATE: Revised agenda posted to reflect the 7:00 p.m. time. Additionally, due to social distancing concerns, all input at the 5:00 p.m. meeting will be via written comment provided at the entrance or electronic comment. Both will be read into the record. https://t.co/jyDrtBTkbN pic.twitter.com/JtsMZHTwF0 — Athens-Clarke County (@accgov) March 16, 2020

Public gatherings were supposed to be limited to 50 people, but the commission instead banned gatherings of more than 10 people from 5 p.m. Tuesday to 5 a.m. April 7, according to the ordinance. The ban will apply to people in bars, restaurants and entertainment establishments but does not apply to employees.

This gathering ban and a voluntary 24-hour “shelter in place” policy replaced the initial discussed proposal of a mandatory curfew. To watch the full meeting, click here.

The overnight curfew would have made it “unlawful for any person to travel, loiter, wander or stroll in or upon the public streets, highways, roads, lanes, parks or other public grounds, public places, public buildings, places of amusement, eating places, vacant lots, or any other place during said declared emergency” between those hours.

Three cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Athens, and 121 cases have been confirmed across the state.

Athens, home to the University of Georgia, has fewer people within its city limits than usual due to state universities suspending class for two weeks. Students are advised to stay away from campus, if possible.

Kemp issued multiple executive orders and asked for the public’s help to ensure everyone is following CDC and Georgia Department of Health (DPH) guidelines during the country’s self-quarantine.

While Kemp is still hesitant to shut down all non-essential businesses or institute a statewide mandatory quarantine, he did issue an executive order to all medically fragile individuals to shelter in place. He listed off these individuals: the elderly, underlying conditions, cancer patients, or anyone suspected of having COVID-19.

In another executive order, Kemp closed all bars and nightclubs in the state and banned large gatherings (more than 10).

Kemp also said to fellow Georgians that if they see anyone not following the CDC of DPH guidelines, “call them out or report them to us.” He seemed prepared to take action against anyone not listening to his instructions or taking COVID-19 seriously.

“Fight this virus with everything you got,” stated Kemp toward the end of his press conference.

Georgians can also call the DPH COVID-19 hotline at (844) 442-2681. If they believe that they’re experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to the novel coronavirus, please contact their primary care doctor or an urgent care clinic. Do not show up at a clinic or emergency room unannounced.

Georgia now has 23 referral-only testing facilities in the state. Kemp released the location of the facilities in a tweet.

Update from March 15, 2020 below

Gov. Kemp, Georgia Department of Health (DPH), and Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) started construction of a quarantine zone in Monroe County on March 14, 2020. Additionally, the Georgia General Assembly ratified the executive order declaring a Public Health State of Emergency.

“This is one of many measures that we’re taking to prepare for any scenario,” said Gov. Kemp. “I appreciate the hard work of GEMA, DPH, and Monroe County officials to protect the health and safety of all Georgians.”

The quarantine space is for people who are unable to self-isolate and is located in the Georgia Public Safety Training Center (GPSTC) Campus in Monroe County. The quarantine space will be able to accommodate twenty temporary housing units. No patients are currently located at the facility.

Monroe County is working with the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) and GPSTC officials to ensure the facility will meet the needs of potential patients while protecting the health and safety of Monroe County residents.

Public Health Emergency Ratification

Kemp can now officially enforce all laws, rules, and regulations associated with the emergency; assume control of all state civil forces and helpers; seize property temporarily for public’s protection; exercise other duties deemed necessary for safety; use all the resources available of the state government; direct evacuation; suspend of alcohol, explosives, and combustibles; and provide temporary housing if applicable.

Since this is a public health emergency, Kemp also has the ability to “implement a mandatory vaccination or quarantine” in accordance with O.C.G.A. Code 38-3-51(i)(2). The Georgia Department of Health (DPH) already has this capability to mandate quarantine and vaccinations.

Additionally, Kemp can direct DPH’s efforts to coordinate the department’s response to the crisis from risk assessments, mitigation, responses, and recovery throughout the state.

The General Assembly also granted Kemp the ability to extend the state of emergency if the elected representative body can’t convene in time.

Original Article:

On Saturday morning, Governor Brian Kemp officially declared Georgia’s first Public Health Emergency, freeing up resources and granting additional powers to Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA). The General Assembly will vote on the executive order on Monday.

A Public Health Emergency is enacted when an infectious disease/illness presents an imminent threat and can potentially result in a high number of deaths and/or exposure could harm large amounts of people.

So, what exactly does this executive order entail for Georgians? In short, it guarantees a continuous supply of medical goods and other emergency materials, as well as giving DPH and GEMA powers to “taken any action necessary to protect the public’s health” with the governor’s permission.

The department of public health is authorized to “actively monitor” persons under investigation (PUI), including a risk assessment within 24 hours of identification, and twice-daily temperature checks for 14 days or until a negative test result.

Here’s the entire executive order for those who want to review it.

State Senator Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, said on Wednesday that he tested positive for coronavirus. Beach was at the Georgia Capitol on Monday for the special session.

He will now be in a 14-day quarantine at home. Beach released a statement:

""After experiencing a fever and cough, I sought medical attention last week. The diagnosis I was given was not coronavirus, but I did get tested for it on Saturday. With medication, I felt better by Monday and thought I was in the clear. Today, however, my test came back positive.

For now, I'm at home. I continue to suffer from a fever and cough, but I'm following doctor's orders, including the admonition to stay away from the hospital unless it becomes difficult to breathe. I know many Georgians are praying hard as we weather this crisis together, and frankly, I'd ask that they pray for me, as well as all the others in our state who are going through this right now – and those who soon will.

I know I face a difficult two weeks, but I'll work to keep everyone updated on my progress. With the support of my wife – who is keeping a safe distance and so far doesn't have symptoms – and my family and friends, I know I'll get through this and get back to work for my constituents.""

Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan released a statement Wednesday that said he will be in self-quarantine due to the positive test results from Beach.

New numbers released Thursday from the Georgia Department of Public Health show there have been 10 deaths and 287 cases of coronavirus across the state.

With the new cases, the DPH released the numbers of tests taken across the state, which totaled more than 1,800.

There have been 1,323 tests done in a commercial lab, with 174 coming in positive. The Department of Public Health Lab has done 508 tests, and had 113 positives.

The number of confirmed and presumed positive cases of COVID-19 rose from 197 on Wednesday to 287 cases in 28 counties on Thursday.

Fulton County has the most cases in the state with 66, followed by Cobb County with 37, Bartow with 26, DeKalb with 22, Dougherty with 20, Cherokee with 16, Gwinnett with 12, Fayette with nine, and Clarke with eight.

Globally, more than 222,000 people have been infected and more than 9,100 people have died from the new coronavirus, Johns Hopkins reported Thursday. Of that total, more than 9,400 confirmed cases are in the United States. There have been 150 deaths in the U.S. have been tied to the virus outbreak, as of Thursday morning.

Kemp instructs medically at-risk individuals to shelter in place - Gilmer,"ATLANTA, Ga – In a March 23 press conference, Gov. Kemp issued multiple executive orders and asked for the public’s help to ensure everyone is following CDC and Georgia Department of Health (DPH) guidelines during the country’s self-quarantine.

While Kemp is still hesitant to shut down all non-essential businesses or institute a statewide mandatory quarantine, he did issue an executive order to all medically fragile individuals to shelter in place. He listed off these individuals: the elderly, underlying conditions, cancer patients, or anyone suspected of having COVID-19.

In another executive order, Kemp closed all bars and nightclubs in the state and banned large gatherings (more than 10).

Kemp also said to fellow Georgians that if they see anyone not following the CDC of DPH guidelines, “call them out or report them to us.” He seemed prepared to take action against anyone not listening to his instructions or taking COVID-19 seriously.

“Fight this virus with everything you got,” stated Kemp toward the end of his press conference.

Georgians can also call the DPH COVID-19 hotline at (844) 442-2681. If they believe that they’re experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to the novel coronavirus, please contact their primary care doctor or an urgent care clinic. Do not show up at a clinic or emergency room unannounced.

Georgia now has 23 referral-only testing facilities in the state. Kemp released the location of the facilities in a tweet.

Update from March 15, 2020 below

Gov. Kemp, Georgia Department of Health (DPH), and Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) started construction of a quarantine zone in Monroe County on March 14, 2020. Additionally, the Georgia General Assembly ratified the executive order declaring a Public Health State of Emergency.

“This is one of many measures that we’re taking to prepare for any scenario,” said Gov. Kemp. “I appreciate the hard work of GEMA, DPH, and Monroe County officials to protect the health and safety of all Georgians.”

The quarantine space is for people who are unable to self-isolate and is located in the Georgia Public Safety Training Center (GPSTC) Campus in Monroe County. The quarantine space will be able to accommodate twenty temporary housing units. No patients are currently located at the facility.

Monroe County is working with the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) and GPSTC officials to ensure the facility will meet the needs of potential patients while protecting the health and safety of Monroe County residents.

Public Health Emergency Ratification

Kemp can now officially enforce all laws, rules, and regulations associated with the emergency; assume control of all state civil forces and helpers; seize property temporarily for public’s protection; exercise other duties deemed necessary for safety; use all the resources available of the state government; direct evacuation; suspend of alcohol, explosives, and combustibles; and provide temporary housing if applicable.

Since this is a public health emergency, Kemp also has the ability to “implement a mandatory vaccination or quarantine” in accordance with O.C.G.A. Code 38-3-51(i)(2). The Georgia Department of Health (DPH) already has this capability to mandate quarantine and vaccinations.

Additionally, Kemp can direct DPH’s efforts to coordinate the department’s response to the crisis from risk assessments, mitigation, responses, and recovery throughout the state.

The General Assembly also granted Kemp the ability to extend the state of emergency if the elected representative body can’t convene in time.

Original Article:

On Saturday morning, Governor Brian Kemp officially declared Georgia’s first Public Health Emergency, freeing up resources and granting additional powers to Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA). The General Assembly will vote on the executive order on Monday.

A Public Health Emergency is enacted when an infectious disease/illness presents an imminent threat and can potentially result in a high number of deaths and/or exposure could harm large amounts of people.

So, what exactly does this executive order entail for Georgians? In short, it guarantees a continuous supply of medical goods and other emergency materials, as well as giving DPH and GEMA powers to “taken any action necessary to protect the public’s health” with the governor’s permission.

The department of public health is authorized to “actively monitor” persons under investigation (PUI), including a risk assessment within 24 hours of identification, and twice-daily temperature checks for 14 days or until a negative test result.

Here’s the entire executive order for those who want to review it.

These actions include “implementing quarantine, isolation, and other necessary public health interventions in accordance with O.C.G.A. Code 31-12-4 and Code 38-3-51(i)(2) or as other authorized by law.

O.C.G.A. Code 31-12-4 addresses isolation and segregation of diseased persons stating the DPH and county boards can isolate or quarantine individuals suspected of harboring infectious diseases, or until they test negative for the contagion. The department also must widely publicize the rules and regulations for the quarantine. O.C.G.A.

“To keep our students, teachers, and administrators safe and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, I am ordering the closure of all public elementary, secondary, and post-secondary schools in Georgia,” said Gov. Kemp. “This measure is critical to reducing local transmission in communities across our state, and I ask Georgians to continue to follow best practices – washing their hands regularly, isolating the elderly and chronically ill, and avoiding large events if possible – in the days and weeks ahead.”

Grady County school superintendent Dr. Kermit Gilliard had called a special meeting of the school system administrators and directors on Friday to discuss closing the school system for students on March 16. Students had already been out of class since March 11, with March 12 and 13 being teacher workdays and professional development days.

All of the systems in southwest Georgia and most in the state had already announced plans to close this week with the blessings of the governor.

After the General Assembly granted the governor with emergency powers to deal with the health crisis on Monday, Kemp took action to close all schools statewide through March 31.

Grady County Schools were previously scheduled to be closed the week of April 6-10 for spring break. Dr. Gilliard and his administrative staff met again Tuesday and the superintendent announced his decision not to reopen the schools on April 1 just to close two days later for a week.

“There are too many families who have plans or reservations that have been long-standing for the spring break holiday. No one hates that our students are missing so many weeks of instruction more than I, but this is the right decision under the circumstances. I’m just hopeful the crisis will have subsided and we can return to school on April 13,” Dr. Gilliard said.

The superintendent on Friday was hesitant to close the local schools since no confirmed cases of the virus had been reported here, but with every other system in the region and the majority in the state planning to close it was not practical to remain open. Governor Kemp’s action this week made that tough decision more palatable, according to Dr. Gilliard.

Under the original plan, 11- and 12-month contracted personnel were to remain on the job and school system janitorial personnel were to spend additional time cleaning and disinfecting school buildings. Teachers reported to work Monday and Tuesday and prepared packets of instructional materials to be distributed to students on Tuesday and for high school students on Wednesday. Teachers were also encouraged to use the time to clean out their rooms of accumulated, unused materials.

Grady County School System assistant superintendent Janet Walden encouraged principals to coordinate with their school media centers to distribute surplus books that were scheduled to be purged from the collection to students for their enlightenment.

In light of the governor’s order Monday, school administrators will assist with the school system’s food distribution program, but will not be required to work the remainder of the day. Phone calls to schools will be routed to the school system central office where personnel there will have a rotating work schedule and will answer calls through April 3.

“Many people are very anxious about this situation and we realize many school activities and events have been canceled and many cannot be rescheduled at this point. We remain hopeful that we can proceed with graduation on May 23,” Dr. Gilliard said.

The state has also suspended the Milestones Test and High School End of Course exams until further notice.

Report cards for the third nine-weeks grading period were scheduled to be distributed this week, however, the school superintendent said that report cards would be held and distributed to students when schools are tentatively scheduled to reopen on April 13.",school_business_closure,25278

Despite the emergency declaration, Dacula will still hold its local election on Tuesday. The city cites “express authorization” given by the Georgia Secretary of State’s Office on March 16 as its reason for proceeding with the vote despite concerns over the spread of the virus.

Emergency declarations give cities additional powers to hold meetings on short notice, use teleconferencing to reduce person-to-person contact and issue executive orders banning actions that could worsen the situation. Dacula’s emergency declaration does not directly address any of these options, but it still has these powers.

Snellville’s emergency declaration allows restaurants in city limits to sell unopened beer and wine and beer growlers to go. Snellville is not placing restrictions on group gatherings or movement, but encourages residents to shelter in place — not leave their homes unless necessary — and to practice social distancing.

Norcross, Lawrenceville, Duluth, Sugar Hill and Suwanee had previously issued state of emergency declarations. Each city is handling it slightly differently, with Suwanee and Duluth banning in-person dining but Lawrenceville officially discouraging it. Norcross’ police chief has discouraged residents from gathering in groups of 10 or more.

The announcement was made during a press conference at the South Central Health District.

What does that mean?

A curfew is now in place between 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.

Non-essential travel is not allowed and that will be enforced by Dublin Police and the Laurens County Sheriff’s Office.

County leaders also moved to limit social gathering to just 10 people, and that includes church, funerals, etc.

In the press conference, health officials reiterated that there is NOT a known source for the two cases in Laurens County, so the hospital is considering it community spread.

The two patients are being kept in isolation at Fairview Park Hospital and no one can visit them.

The sheriff's office also said via Facebook that they will begin responding to non-emergency calls or minor crimes by phone, when possible, to limit exposure.

Deputies will continue to respond to all emergency calls and crimes that are essential for purposes of evidence collection or public safety.

The decision to respond will be on a case-by-case basis.

The Council had only two agenda items to discuss—temporarily limiting public access to City Hall and a state of emergency resolution.

Prior to a more than one-hour public discussion of the draft emergency resolution, the Council unanimously voted to close City Hall to the public until further notice, beginning at noon today. This follows earlier proactive steps taken by the city to prevent further spread of the Coronavirus by limiting public access at City Hall; encouraging online and payment drop-off options; and creating a virtual option for the March 19 Council meeting.

Mayor Sam Norton said, “As a small city, it’s critical that we keep our staff healthy to ensure continued services to our residents. We continue to closely monitor this situation with the help of our state and federal partners, but working together, we’ll all get through this.”

The draft emergency resolution is similar to actions taken across Georgia in communities, both rural and metropolitan, and in communities with confirmed diagnoses as well as communities with no confirmed cases. By declaring a state of emergency, it allows city officials to take necessary steps to ensure the overall health and welfare of city residents.

“This action isn’t something that we take lightly,” said Mayor Sam Norton. “None of us support government overreach, but in times like this, local governments must be empowered to take decisive actions when it comes to the public health and safety.”

Among the emergency measures to be considered by the Council during its next special called meeting on Wednesday, March 25 at 4:00 p.m.:

Permitting boards, commissions and agencies of the city to conduct meetings and take votes by teleconference.

Allowing the city manager, with approval of the mayor, to take necessary actions to protect the public health and safety including temporary closures of city facilities, cancelling certain city functions, and allowing staff and business to be conducted at alternative locations among other administrative and emergency actions necessary to protect the public health and perform essential functions.

Requiring restaurants to suspend dine-in services, but permitting delivery, drive-thru, or take-out services and to have patrons, employees and contractors maintain at least six (6) feet of personal distance.

Requiring gyms, fitness centers, and other high-contact business models to suspend daily operations.

Prohibiting public and private gatherings of more than 10 people, occurring outside a household (this provision would not prevent of business activity or the delivery of medical and other health services unless otherwise specified).

Further establishing the administrative succession roles, following the City Charter and current form of government, by designating the finance director to succeed the city manager if he is unable to perform his duties and if both the city manager and the finance director are unable to perform these duties, the mayor as chief executive officer of the city will assume the city manager duties.

Residents and business owners who would like to share feedback regarding the proposed emergency resolution can send comments to the City by email at customerservice@dahlonega.gov.

The possible state of emergency follows the Council’s March 19, 2020 special called meeting where the City Council unanimously approved two measures that assist with city efforts in responding to COVID-19 (Coronavirus). Those measures included a comprehensive employee telecommuting policy and a temporary moratorium on special event applications. Effective March 20, the city is no longer accepting new special event applications until further notice.

As part of these recent changes, all non-essential city staff will immediately shift to remote worksites, telecommuting from their homes.

“All essential city services continue to operate uninterrupted at this time,” said City Manager Bill Schmid. “Shifting non-essential employees out of our city facilities helps us limit potential exposure to essential staff, protecting their and the public’s health and working to ensure we can continue our core services.”

The Dahlonega Downtown Development Authority (DDA) recently notified city businesses that State of Georgia received its approved emergency declaration, making small businesses eligible to apply for Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration.

Georgia's governor said Monday that he was ordering all bars and nightclubs in the state to close because of the coronavirus and giving state officials the authority to shut down businesses that don't comply as the number of infections confirmed statewide reached 800.

The order will take effect at noon Tuesday and last for just under two weeks, Gov. Brian Kemp said at a news conference. He said the state would also ban gatherings of 10 or more people unless people could maintain a distance of 6 feet (2 meters). Kemp's announcement did not mention restaurants.

“These measures are intended to ensure the health and safety of Georgians across our state,"" he said. “And I would ask for everyone’s cooperation over the next two weeks.”

The measures fall short of orders issued in other states and what some lawmakers and health experts had sought. Indiana, Michigan and West Virginia joined states including California, Illinois and New York in asking or ordering their residents to stay home and keep businesses closed — directives that now cover more than one-third of the U.S. population.

Kemp said he would order people at increased risk from the virus to shelter in place. That population includes people in long-term care facilities, those with chronic lung disease and those undergoing cancer treatment, he said.

The restrictions in Georgia came as the number of cases of the virus in the state rose Monday evening to 800. The death toll rose to 26, increasing by one from Sunday. Kemp also joined several other governors in sending a letter to leaders in Congress asking that they approve additional funding to states in the form of block grants to fight the virus.

Kemp had previously ordered schools to close but refrained from taking stronger steps, leaving those decisions to local governments instead. Individual counties in Georgia have placed restrictions on businesses and gatherings.

The CEO of Metro Atlanta's DeKalb County, Michael Thurmond, issued an executive order Monday that prohibits gatherings of 10 or more people, closes playgrounds and asks all residents to shelter in place “as much as possible.” Beginning Tuesday, the order stipulates that restaurants and bars are prohibited from having dine-in service and businesses such as bowling alleys, nail salons and barbers are limited to a maximum occupancy of 10 people.

DeKalb joins several counties including Athens-Clarke County, home to the University of Georgia, as well as hard-hit Dougherty County in southwest Georgia in implementing restrictions.

Dougherty County, where Albany is the county seat, continues to have the worst confirmed infection rate statewide. Its 64 cases are more than 10 times the positive rate statewide. Other counties with high infection rates include Bartow County in northwest Georgia and Lee County, a suburban neighbor of Dougherty County.

On Sunday, the mayor and county commission chairman issued an executive order making the conditions of a shelter-in-place order there more stringent, including requiring essential businesses such as grocery stores not to exceed 50% occupancy.

Albany Mayor Bo Dorough said during a news conference Monday that surrounding counties need to take similar precautions.

“County lines are really nothing more than a place in the sand,” Dorough said. ""This virus is totally indifferent to county boundaries. So if people are coming into Albany to shop and to work, there have to be precautions taken in our surrounding counties.”

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.

Of those who died, the youngest two were 42 and the oldest two were 85, with an average age of 66, according to Department of Public Health records. Dougherty County has recorded six deaths, while Cobb County has five. No other county has more than two.

Meanwhile, Georgia Ports Authority executive director Griff Lynch said Monday that he was still hopeful a drop in cargo volumes would be just a short-term “blip” that would end by May. Lynch said cargo containers moving through the Port of Savannah appear to be down about 20% compared with last March. That’s because fewer imports are coming from China after the virus forced manufacturers to shut down.

Cargo shipped from Asia is already starting to rebound, Lynch said. But now he’s watching U.S. retailers. If stores are closed for extended periods and their inventories pile up, Lynch said, “we may not see the impact of that until the summertime.”

At least four members of the Georgia state Senate have now tested positive after Republican Sen. Brandon Beach of Alpharetta became the first to do so last week. Republican Sen. Kay Kirkpatrick of Marietta, Republican Sen. Bruce Thompson of White and Democratic Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta have announced positive diagnoses. Williams is also the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.

Thompson said he was released from Northside Cherokee hospital Sunday after a period in the intensive care unit.

A post on the Monroe County Board of Commissioners Facebook page says the county’s state of emergency will remain in effect through midnight on Friday, April 10.

Monroe County interim Public Safety/Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Meadows says four things are accomplished by declaring a countywide state of emergency.

1.) Monroe County EMA can activate its Emergency Operations Plan.

2.) Commissioners have the authority to waive procedures and establish curfews (although commissioners decided not to implement a countywide curfew at this point).

3.) Establishes a voluntary daily shelter in place policy between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. that will take effect beginning at 9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 25.

4.) Prohibits gatherings of 10 persons or more, including in local restaurants and churches. However, grocery stores, fuel stations, pharmacies and health and medical care facilities are excluded.

Exclusions to the voluntary shelter in place policy include:

1.) traveling to and from an emergency funeral,

2.) traveling to and from work,

3.) traveling to and from activities involving the exercise of First Amendment rights,

4.) interstate and intrastate vehicular travel through Monroe County,

5.) walking/running for physical exercise,

6.) traveling to procure food,

7.) traveling to seek medical attention,

8.) emergency services personnel executing this order,

9.) activities relating to agriculture, forestry and tending or caring for crops and livestock.

Meadows told commissioners he dislikes calling for emergency declarations because it’s indicative of a problem but that in this instance it’s in the county’s best interest to protect the lives of citizens and to reduce Coronavirus spread.

“Protection of life is the highest priority for limiting the effects of COVID-19,” Meadows said.

Monday’s resolution came nine days after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a statewide public health emergency on March 14. Kemp is expected to hold a press conference at 5 p.m. Monday, March 23, during which further statewide restrictions could be implemented.

Georgia,Rabun,43913,https://rabun.fetchyournews.com/2020/03/23/kemp-public-health-emergency-quarantine-gema/,UPDATE: Gov. Kemp instructs medically at-risk individuals to shelter in place - Rabun,"ATLANTA, Ga – In a March 23 press conference, Gov. Kemp issued multiple executive orders and asked for the public’s help to ensure everyone is following CDC and Georgia Department of Health (DPH) guidelines during the country’s self-quarantine.

While Kemp is still hesitant to shut down all non-essential businesses or institute a statewide mandatory quarantine, he did issue an executive order to all medically fragile individuals to shelter in place. He listed off these individuals: the elderly, underlying conditions, cancer patients, or anyone suspected of having COVID-19.

In another executive order, Kemp closed all bars and nightclubs in the state and banned large gatherings (more than 10).

Kemp also said to fellow Georgians that if they see anyone not following the CDC of DPH guidelines, “call them out or report them to us.” He seemed prepared to take action against anyone not listening to his instructions or taking COVID-19 seriously.

“Fight this virus with everything you got,” stated Kemp toward the end of his press conference.

Georgians can also call the DPH COVID-19 hotline at (844) 442-2681. If they believe that they’re experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to the novel coronavirus, please contact their primary care doctor or an urgent care clinic. Do not show up at a clinic or emergency room unannounced.

Georgia now has 23 referral-only testing facilities in the state. Kemp released the location of the facilities in a tweet.

Update from March 15, 2020 below

Gov. Kemp, Georgia Department of Health (DPH), and Georgia Emergency Management Agency (GEMA) started construction of a quarantine zone in Monroe County on March 14, 2020. Additionally, the Georgia General Assembly ratified the executive order declaring a Public Health State of Emergency.

“This is one of many measures that we’re taking to prepare for any scenario,” said Gov. Kemp. “I appreciate the hard work of GEMA, DPH, and Monroe County officials to protect the health and safety of all Georgians.”

The quarantine space is for people who are unable to self-isolate and is located in the Georgia Public Safety Training Center (GPSTC) Campus in Monroe County. The quarantine space will be able to accommodate twenty temporary housing units. No patients are currently located at the facility.

Monroe County is working with the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) and GPSTC officials to ensure the facility will meet the needs of potential patients while protecting the health and safety of Monroe County residents.

Public Health Emergency Ratification

Kemp can now officially enforce all laws, rules, and regulations associated with the emergency; assume control of all state civil forces and helpers; seize property temporarily for public’s protection; exercise other duties deemed necessary for safety; use all the resources available of the state government; direct evacuation; suspend of alcohol, explosives, and combustibles; and provide temporary housing if applicable.

Since this is a public health emergency, Kemp also has the ability to “implement a mandatory vaccination or quarantine” in accordance with O.C.G.A. Code 38-3-51(i)(2). The Georgia Department of Health (DPH) already has this capability to mandate quarantine and vaccinations.

Additionally, Kemp can direct DPH’s efforts to coordinate the department’s response to the crisis from risk assessments, mitigation, responses, and recovery throughout the state.

The General Assembly also granted Kemp the ability to extend the state of emergency if the elected representative body can’t convene in time.

Original Article:

On Saturday morning, Governor Brian Kemp officially declared Georgia’s first Public Health Emergency, freeing up resources and granting additional powers to Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA). The General Assembly will vote on the executive order on Monday.

A Public Health Emergency is enacted when an infectious disease/illness presents an imminent threat and can potentially result in a high number of deaths and/or exposure could harm large amounts of people.

So, what exactly does this executive order entail for Georgians? In short, it guarantees a continuous supply of medical goods and other emergency materials, as well as giving DPH and GEMA powers to “taken any action necessary to protect the public’s health” with the governor’s permission.

The department of public health is authorized to “actively monitor” persons under investigation (PUI), including a risk assessment within 24 hours of identification, and twice-daily temperature checks for 14 days or until a negative test result.

Here’s the entire executive order for those who want to review it.

These actions include “implementing quarantine, isolation, and other necessary public health interventions in accordance with O.C.G.A. Code 31-12-4 and Code 38-3-51(i)(2) or as other authorized by law.

O.C.G.A. Code 31-12-4 addresses isolation and segregation of diseased persons stating the DPH and county boards can isolate or quarantine individuals suspected of harboring infectious diseases, or until they test negative for the contagion. The department also must widely publicize the rules and regulations for the quarantine. O.C.G.A. Code 38-3-51(i)(2) lists the due processes afforded to those in quarantine and seeks to leave before the department of public health gives the okay.

Additionally, the Georgia Emergency Operations Plan is activated. DPH and GEMA must coordinate with state, federal, and local government, recovery operations, mitigation, emergency response activities, CDC, and the release of the national stockpile of goods.

The public must also be informed about public health operations, including education and prevention measures.

Commercial vehicles have certain restrictions lifted, so they can operate more freely to move supplies throughout the state.

Georgia Board of Nurses and Georgia Composite Medical Board can grant temporary licenses to applicants that are in good standing with an equivalent board in another state.

All state and local healthcare facilities, physicians, clinics, and personnel must comply with the governor’s orders.

Price gouging on products on goods and services necessary in this public health emergency is prohibited.

The Georgia National Guard was called in on March 14 to assist in the crisis.

The executive order expires on April 13, 2020, unless Gov. Kemp renews it.",shelter_in_place,16235

“To keep our students, teachers, and administrators safe and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, I am ordering the closure of all public elementary, secondary, and post-secondary schools in Georgia from March 18, 2020 to March 31, 2020,” said Governor Kemp. “This measure is critical to reducing local transmission in communities across our state, and I ask Georgians to continue to follow best practices – washing their hands regularly, isolating the elderly and chronically ill, and avoiding large events if possible – in the days and weeks ahead.”

The Seminole County School System was notified last week that a school employee exhibited symptoms of COVID-19, also known as Coronavirus. This employee was possibly exposed to the virus in a physician’s office in another state. Testing is still in progress, and as of press time on Wednesday, March 18, this person had not tested positive for the virus.

After learning last week of the possibility of a locally infected person, the school system called parents and guardians of all students who were in contact with this employee, and continues to follow the protocol recommended by the Georgia Department of Health while waiting for the test results. “We are in close communication with public health officials and the Georgia Department of Education, and we will share updated information as it becomes available,” commented Seminole County School Superintendent Mark Earnest.

In an effort to implement proactive measures to minimize risk to students, employees, and families, school authorities closed all schools and suspended all extra-curricular activities through March 27. At that time, school was scheduled to resume on Monday, March 30th.

Once the Governor made the announcement that schools would be closed through March 31, the Seminole County Board of Education decided, instead of reopening school on April 1 only to close three days later for the already scheduled Spring Break, the school system would resume operations on April 13, unless otherwise directed by the Governor.",school_business_closure,8945

The Order requires all restaurants, bars, private clubs, and similar food or drink establishments to close their dining rooms no later than 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Tuesday, March 24, 2020.

“We hope our restaurants will choose to continue servicing customers during this unprecedented crisis by utilizing drive-thru, curbside pickup, carryout and/or delivery options,” said Whitfield. “For eating establishments licensed to serve alcohol, we are also relaxing rules that might have prevented them from providing additional menu items.”

Along with new restrictions on dine-in food service, the Order prohibits social gatherings of ten or more people, requires gym and fitness centers to close, and restricts visitation at nursing homes, retirement homes, long-term care and assisted living facilities in Walker County. The Order follows a reduction in Walker County Government operations to mission critical services that took effect today.

“There is clear evidence of widespread exposure in our region to COVID-19, presenting a serious risk to the health, safety and welfare of all Walker County residents. We must work together as a community to send a clear message about the seriousness of this pandemic if we are to slow the spread,” Whitfield added.

SANDPOINT — Bonner County declared a local state of emergency Tuesday due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The declaration mainly opens up the county’s spending authority and eases other requirements so the county can respond quickly to the pandemic. It also allows for the county to be reimbursed for expenses it incurs because of COVID-19.

“Basically, it gives us the ability if we have to spend any money on this issue — which we may or may not — it can be a reimbursable amount that can be given back to county taxpayers,” Commissioner Dan McDonald said on Tuesday.

McDonald gave the heads-up about the declaration on social media on Monday to allay concerns that it would infringe on residents’ rights. He called the declaration a standard operating procedure, which follows Gov. Brad Little’s statewide emergency declaration.

“I put it out last night on Facebook that it was coming because I didn’t want people to panic. It’s SOP,” he said.

Idaho has nine laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus, the Idaho Department of Health & Welfare said on Tuesday. Seventy-six people are being monitored by Idaho public health officials and 39 people are no longer being monitored.

A total of 295 people have been tested through the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories and another 58 people have been tested through commercial labs, according to Health & Welfare’s novel coronavirus online update page (coronavirus.idaho.gov)

Counties with confirmed cases include Ada, Blaine, Madison and Teton.

Statewide, State Health Officer Scott Harris has issued orders prohibiting on-site restaurant dining and non-work gatherings of more than 25 people that cannot maintain a consistent 6-foot distance between people.

Law enforcement officials can issue misdemeanor citations for people who violate the state health officer's orders against large public gatherings, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said.

Marshall on Saturday issued guidance to law enforcement agencies, saying they have the authority to issue citations to people who refuse to comply with the orders, although he urged restraint in doing so.

“While the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the government’s evolving response seem to demand some restraint related to criminal enforcement of this order, if a violator has been made aware of the state health order and the refusal to comply presents a threat to public health and safety, the penalties of (the law) are available as an enforcement tool,"" Marshall wrote.

Marshall said a person found guilty of violating an order of the State Board of Health shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, would be fined between $25 and $500.

The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.

On Monday, Boise Mayor Lauren McLean declared a state of emergency over concerns about coronavirus. On Tuesday, the Boise City Council approved an ordinance that specifies exactly what power McLean has in a public health emergency.

Under the ordinance, McLean could order Boiseans to take part in social distancing, including by limiting the number of people who may gather in one location, restricting travel and canceling public meetings and hearings.

McLean could issue an “isolation order” to require infected or exposed people to isolate themselves and restrict access to certain geographic areas, or a “quarantine order” that would do much the same but also specify quarantine conditions. If necessary, she could suspend “nonessential” city services or meetings of city commissions such as the Planning and Zoning Commission.

All orders would require her to consult first with the City Council. Violations would be a misdemeanor.

The ordinance would not restrict schools, limit operations of hospitals or critical infrastructure, or limit “activities necessary to buy, sell or otherwise deliver food and necessities.”

State law already grants mayors authority to enforce “any health or quarantine ordinance.” Council member Holli Woodings said Tuesday morning that the ordinance allows the city to eliminate guesswork about what that power means.

“The last time the mayor actually had to use any of these powers was like 100 years ago, and that was related to a disease that sheep had,” Woodings said. “We use these rarely, but they allow the mayor to be nimble and responsive.”

Woodings, speaking at the City Council meeting Tuesday night and getting emotional, said the ordinance showed the council had the mayor’s back. Council President Elaine Clegg said she thought the ordinance would help the city “avert the very worst” of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Council members talked about how such orders would affect restaurants and their owners and employees. Council member T.J. Thomson said he felt the ordinance would provide protection to businesses that closed as a result of an order.

McLean said she would not take the power lightly. She said she asked city attorneys to sit with the American Civil Liberties Union to make sure liberties are not infringed upon and said city officials were looking into ways to make the ordinance tighter in the future.

The council approved the new ordinance unanimously. It heard all three legally required readings of the ordinance Tuesday night so that the new measure could take effect upon passage. Usually, the readings occur at sequential meetings spread over several weeks.

As of Tuesday evening, Idaho had nine cases of the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, three of which were in Ada County. Across the state, 353 people have been tested.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised people to distance themselves from others. President Donald Trump on Monday advised people to avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more, to stop discretionary travel and to stay out of restaurants and bars.

Boise City Hall is closed, but the council chambers were open for Tuesday night’s meeting. Only McLean and two members of the council will be in attendance at the meeting; others participated via video chat.

| March 16, 2020 4:45 PM

While there are no reported cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in North Idaho, both state and local agencies are already taking steps to limit the virus’ spread and ensure that resources are available to handle such an event.

The Shoshone County Board of County Commissioners announced Monday afternoon that they would be following the lead of Idaho Gov. Brad Little and other Idaho counties by declaring a state of emergency outlined in Idaho Code § 46-1011 and all relevant sections of Idaho Code.

“The county views its leadership role in times like this as being very crucial,” said BOCC Chairman Mike Fitzgerald. “We are taking necessary, early and aggressive action against the virus.”

Specifically, Fitzgerald added, Shoshone County is implementing measures that are recommended by health organizations to slow the spread of the virus and to reduce the number of people who would ultimately get sick.

There are no known suspected cases of COVID-19 within Shoshone County as of Monday, but this emergency declaration allows county officials and related emergency personnel to activate additional resources and communication measures to ensure the public is regularly informed.

“In doing so, it emphasizes the risks that the virus presents and urges persons to take precautions if they have reason to believe they were infected,” Fitzgerald said.

A news release on Monday from the county states that an emergency action plan is being implemented in order to minimize non-essential government functions and in-person interaction among the county departments. Based upon the emergency action plan, the following non-essential county services will be suspended until further notice:

• Driver’s Licensing and Motor Vehicle Services (in-person)

• Notaries Public

• Jail visitation

• Jury duty

Elected officials plan to meet regularly to monitor the situation and discuss emergency plan implementation measures as the matter develops.

Anyone who meets high risk criteria pursuant to the recommendations of Panhandle Health District and the CDC will have limited access to the Shoshone County Courthouse and related public buildings. See the News-Press story regarding school/business closures in the Silver Valley for more information on PHD recommendations.

Members of the public are encouraged to use telephone or other electronic communications to contact county offices.

The county will take all necessary steps to assist in providing options for the public to deliver documents and address other matters that require in-person processing. This and other information will be published on the Shoshone County website at www.shoshonecounty.id.gov and additional notifications will be made as the situation changes.

As of Monday, these precautionary measures are being implemented through April 10.",state_of_emergency,12690

First, words like States of Emergency and shelter in place don’t mean “lockdown” or “martial law”. Often, a state of emergency is declared because it makes it legally easier to receive disaster assistance. At the moment, the City of Twin Falls is down a couple of firefighters. They were exposed last week to a patient with COVID-19. The city doesn’t have a lot of firefighters to spare. And as some of you know, voters rejected plans for the construction of detox units at fire stations. These would be used by staff returning from calls.

It’ll be at the ready if and when the county would need to respond to a potential outbreak.

Twin Falls County will today join the city in considering a State of Emergency.

It’ll be at the ready if and when the county would need to respond to a potential outbreak. This could happen among county departments and offices or even inside an overcrowded jail. The latter would require protective gear for medical personnel and Jail Deputies.

Such an order from the County Commission would speed purchase of supplies.

Some county offices are already limiting public contact. You would see this at the licensing division of the DMV, and I believe the Buhl DMV is restricting public access.

One other interesting point, if cases of coronavirus peak later this week, as some expect, then any States of Emergency in the Magic Valley may be short in duration.

ZuHone told the board that state law allows the emergency declaration to be in place for no more than a week unless the county board chairman lifts it earlier or the board votes to extend it.

The patient was treated at the Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center emergency room. The Illinois Department of Public Health notified the hospital late Friday that he had tested positive for the virus, the hospital said.

In the wake of the first confirmed COVID-19 infection in DuPage County, county board Chairman Dan Cronin is signing a disaster proclamation for the entire county, effective Monday.

""This disaster proclamation is critical, as it puts our emergency operation plan into play for everyone here in DuPage County,"" Cronin said Sunday during a news conference at the Linda A. Kurzawa Community Center in Wheaton.

""We are taking every possible action to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our communities,"" he added.

The declaration, which follows similar measures in Cook and McHenry counties, comes one day after state health officials announced the county's first confirmed coronavirus case.

Officials said infected person is a woman in her 60s who had been living at the Chateau Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Willowbrook. She has been hospitalized and is listed in stable condition.

Ron Nunziato, CEO of Extended Care LLC, the consulting company working with Chateau, said the facility is following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Illinois Department of Public Health and the county health department.

""As always, our residents' health, safety and well-being is our highest priority,"" he said. ""We anticipated it wasn't if, it was when, a resident would become affected.""

He said the center previously implemented increased infection prevention practices and strategies, including symptom screening of staff and residents, enhanced environmental cleaning and disinfection, and visitor screening and restrictions.

""We believe that because of the proactive approach to this crisis, we were able to identify this quickly,"" Nunziato added.

The center is working with state and county health authorities to promptly identify and monitor people who have had recent contact with the resident, he said.

Karen Ayala, executive director of the DuPage County Health Department, said the agency has been monitoring COVID-19 since late January.

""We expected to see cases here,"" she said. ""We have been talking about the eventuality of what happened yesterday, and we are absolutely not surprised nor are we panicked with this news.""

The department has worked closely with schools, community organizations and health care providers to highlight prevention steps, including washing hands, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home while sick, Ayala said.

In the meantime, Cronin said the county's health department and office of homeland security and emergency management are available to help local leaders coordinate municipal responses.

As part of the response, Cronin said, Comcast has pledged to make hi-speed data service available for 60 days to low-income families who do not have the company's internet service in their homes.

Comcast also has opened its Wi-Fi access points across DuPage County for subscribers and nonsubscribers at thousands of points throughout the county. The company will not disconnect service or charge late fees during this time, Cronin said.

The order does the following:

Orders the closure of all bars, brew pubs, wineries, distilleries with public tasting rooms, and casinos in Gallatin County effective Monday, March 16 at 9 p.m. through March 24.

Orders restaurants to close dining room services during the same time period but allows take-out and delivery service to operate; Allows limited exceptions for food service establishments that are the primary meal sources for a population that depends on it as one of its sole or primary sources of food, such a university-based dining facilities or cafeterias in hospital and care facilities; The restrictions to not apply to grocery stores, deli counters within grocery stores, or convenience stores.

“Our goal in taking these actions is to slow down the spread of covid-19 in order to allow our health care system to prepare, build resources, and plan,” Kelley said. “We know these actions will create significant and lasting economic impact and disruption and we do not take them lightly. But in light of the current situation, we feel it is a necessary step.”

Kelley said a major concern informing the action is the potential for hundreds of people gathering for St. Patrick’s Day celebration in bars and restaurants all over Gallatin County.

“This situation is serious enough to warrant school closures so it seems reasonable and prudent to put off St. Patrick’s Day celebrations until after a pandemic response,” Kelley said.

The decision comes on the heels of recommendation from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to all Americans to limit gatherings of 50 or more people as part of a nationwide effort to reduce disease spread through social distancing. The restrictions announced in Gallatin County and other Montana communities follows similar measures announced recently in Illinois, California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan and Washington.

Phil Murphy speaks during a news conference | AP Photo Murphy directs New Jersey businesses to close amid fight against coronavirus

New Jersey is closed for business.

Gov. Phil Murphy issued a pair of executive orders Saturday afternoon directing residents to stay indoors, shut down most of the state’s retail shops and wipe away the “patchwork” of county and local regulations that have emerged over the last three weeks in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.

Advertisement

The orders follow similar directives from fellow Democrats California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf as reports of new cases continue to sweep across the U.S. with a boom in testing.

While Murphy’s executive order isn’t identical to those issued in other states, the underlying message is the same: Stay home.

“We don’t take these measures lightly, nor do we take them easily,” said Murphy, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association. He said he wanted to make sure he and his staff had addressed “every aspect of daily life” in crafting the order. “We wanted to make sure we got this right at the first go.”

As of Saturday, 1,327 people have tested positive for coronavirus in New Jersey, 442 of whom had their test results reported to the state Department of Health between Friday and Saturday afternoon. Five more deaths have been linked to Covid-19 in New Jersey, the governor said Saturday, bringing the total to 16.

Non-essential businesses have to close their doors by 8 p.m. Saturday and there's no end in sight.

Still, the shutdown order specifically allows a sweeping array of businesses to keep operating, including everything from grocery stores, farmers markets and farms that sell food directly to customers to pharmacies and medical marijuana dispensaries to hardware stores, laundromats and stores that principally sell supplies for children under five years old.

Another industry spared: liquor stores.

Health care and social services will have to remain accessible, Murphy said, adding that other industries like manufacturing, trucking and construction will also be able to stay open.

Residents will be required to stay from home unless they are reporting to work, buying groceries, exercising or a handful of other exceptions.

Offices will have to allow their employees to work from home “wherever possible,” Murphy said. The order grants State Police Superintendent Patrick Callahan the power to add more businesses to the list of those that must suspend operations at their brick-and-mortar locations.

“We want you to assume everything that’s not on that list is non-essential,” Murphy said. “If you are a business that makes something, or if you’re a business of any sort, that we didn’t ask to be closed down — you have to have 100 percent work from home policies in place.”

Callahan, who also spoke at the Saturday press conference, said residents found to have violated the order can be charged with disorderly persons offenses.

With New Jersey likely weeks away from approaching an anticipated surge in coronavirus-related hospitalizations, the governor offered no timeline for how long his executive order will remain in effect.

Murphy, along with New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli, has also been working to reopen shuttered hospitals and medical facilities to prepare for the wave of patients suffering from respiratory problems linked to Covid-19.

In daily media briefings, Persichilli has repeatedly emphasized the state lacks the supplies, beds and workforce to account for a surge.

New Jersey has taken incremental steps toward Murphy’s “stay-at-home” order over the last week, rolling out increasingly restrictive directives that shuttered some of the state’s largest businesses, including malls and casinos, as well as consumer-facing shops like salons and tattoo parlors.

County and local officials, particularly those in North Jersey, have been pushing stringent recommendations and, in some cases, directives for residents to remain at home.

“We cannot have a patchwork of regulations that change from one twon or one county to another,” Murphy said at Saturday’s press conference. “Folks’ hearts are in the right place. That’s not the question. But we have got to run this state with one set of rules.”

Murphy’s orders arrived as the state announced a 50 percent increase in the total number of coronavirus patients statewide, which Murphy attributed to a combination of community spread and expanded access to testing.

“Could we have done this yesterday? Yeah, we probably could have, but the fact of the matter is, I think we landed in a really good place of what we’re deeming essential and non-essential,” Murphy said at the press conference. “There’s not a whole lot more we can do, to be honest with you.”

“We reserve the right [to do more], if something does come up where we think we can make a meaningful difference,” he added.",school_business_closure,22641

On Friday, shortly after the Knox County Health Department ordered bars to close and restaurants to limit seating, Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon took things one step further with an executive order to close restaurants, bars, gyms and commercial event venues within city limits for two weeks.

The Knox County order went into effect immediately Friday afternoon, while the city order starts at 8 p.m. Both decisions were made to combat the spread of the coronavirus.

Kincannon said during a news conference Friday that the city decided ""to be a little more proactive"" because the city has a denser population than the county, making the risk of transmission higher.

The city's order will allow restaurants and bars to continue delivery and takeout service, according to a news release.

What's considered city or county?: Check out this map.

More about the county's order

In addition to closing bars, the Knox County order also requires that restaurants limit seating to half capacity or 100 people, whichever number is lower.

Table layouts must follow health guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to keep people 6 feet apart.

The Health Department defined the types of establishments regulated by its order:

Bars

Businesses licensed to serve food whose primary business is alcohol service

Restaurants that are businesses whose primary business is food service

Restaurants with an attached bar, also known as a a food service establishment permitted as an auxiliary food service operation

Restaurants with attached bars must limit capacity at the bar area to 10% with no standing allowed, as well as reduce table service capacity to 50%.

Takeout and drive-thru services are not affected, according to a news release from the Health Department.

According to the county, to-go growlers of beer will be considered carryout.

""COVID-19 is an evolving situation, but Knox Countians are urged to exercise caution and maintain good hygiene practices as serious risks still exist for our vulnerable populations,"" the release said.

It's time to 'take care of each other'

Knox County Public Health Officer Dr. Martha Buchanan said in a news conference Friday that her staff will be performing checks to make sure restaurants and bars are in compliance.

Buchanan said she made the decision after seeing an increasing number of confirmed coronavirus cases in surrounding counties.

""We're going to have to take care of each other,"" Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs said at the conference. ""We're going to see a lot of people lose their livelihoods.""

Buchanan encouraged people to continue supporting businesses, including placing takeout orders and purchasing gift cards.

The city said in a news release that it will designate metered parking spaces in front of restaurants and loosen parking enforcement to help expedite pickup service.

'We need to support these businesses'

""I feel it is my responsibility to take all the preventative measures possible to reduce the health impacts in the City of Knoxville,"" Kincannon said in the release.

The city consulted with businesses and experts, including former Gov. Bill Haslam, who applauded Kincannon's decision, according to the release. The decision also garnered support from doctors, University of Tennessee, Knoxville Chancellor Donde Plowman and the YMCA of East Tennessee.

Buchanan said her decision for the county was a difficult one, especially considering the Knox County families that will be affected.

""We need to support these businesses through this very difficult time and their employees who are also being impacted by this,"" she said.

Where else is this happening?

The mayors and city managers of Sevier County, Gatlinburg, Pigeon Forge, Pittman Center and Sevierville have asked the Tennessee Department of Health to issue orders for restaurants and bars in Sevier County.

In Sevier County, than means the bars will close, but dine-in restaurants can remain open if they reduce their capacity by 50% and follow CDC guidelines for safe spacing between people.

A growing number of states have closed or sharply eliminated the operations of bars, including California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

Illinois,Lake,43908.95833,https://patch.com/illinois/lakeforest/gyms-ordered-closed-lake-bluff-declares-coronavirus-emergency,Gyms Ordered Closed As Lake Bluff Declares Coronavirus Emergency,"LAKE BLUFF, IL — Village trustees voted unanimously via speakerphone at an emergency village board meeting Wednesday to amend the Lake Bluff municipal code to expand the definition of a civil emergency to include epidemics of infectious diseases.

Village President Kathy O'Hara then declared such an emergency in response to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. Trustees then extended the state of emergency until the end of the next village board meeting. O'Hara was the only elected official to attend the meeting in person.

""The Illinois Department of Public Health has now confirmed localized community person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 in Illinois, significantly increasing the risk of exposure and infection to Illinois' general public, and creating an extreme public health risk in the village and throughout the state,"" O'Hara said, in the declaration.

As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, there were 22 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, among Lake County residents, according to the Lake County Health Department. The department learned of the first infected county resident a week earlier.

""As has been experienced in other locales in the United States and around the world, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has the potential to infect large numbers of people in a short amount of time, placing extreme burdens on the health care system and the economy,"" O'Hara declared.

In her first set of emergency orders, O'Hara mandated the closure of all physical fitness facilities and membership sports and recreation clubs starting Thursday.

Zak Rivera, owner of Focused Results Personal Training, addressed the board before the vote. He explained the basis of his fitness business was one-on-one training and there was never more than eight people present at one time. Amid concerns over the coronavirus, he said about half of the sessions conducted by personal trainers at his facility have been conducted online and virtual.



""We've been diligent and we understand the severity of the issue, and we're just trying to operate our business as any small business owner would like to do, and also take care of our clients,"" Rivera said, asking the village president to allow him to stay open and offering to adhere to additional hygienic restrictions.

""We're trying to have our clients be safe as well as our trainers, but as our trainers — and obviously myself and my wife who own the space — are reliant on our doors to be open, or at least to be able to do virtual sessions,"" he said. ""In order to pay the trainers, for them to make a living, for us to make a living, it's pretty much imperative that we have that ability to be able to operate our business to some degree.""

O'Hara said she truly appreciated Rivera's concerns. Later in the meeting, a trustee asked the village president if an exception could be made for local small businesses to conduct one-on-one training.

""I am certainly not thrilled about having to do this declaration. But I am closing them all, and that is under my authority to do so,"" O'Hara said.



Despite the hardship for affected businesses and workers, O'Hara said the public's health and safety were the paramount concerns of village leaders.

""I truly believe that at this point in time we have to do this,"" O'Hara said. ""I am hoping that it will not be for a long duration, and I truly understand how this will affect a lot of local businesses and everything else — both locally and nationally.""

The declaration also authorized emergency purchasing and staffing measures for village employees in the police and public works departments, as needed, to protect health and safety.

The amendment to the village code and emergency declaration is essentially identical to similar such ordinances incorporated by other suburban municipal clients of Elrod Friedman, recently co-founded by Lake Bluff's village attorney. The changes define civil emergencies and extraordinary emergency authorities.



The Illinois Municipal Code grants local governments the power to declare their own states of emergency, and the firm encouraged all its municipal clients to update their codes to include the authority, according to co-founder Steve Elrod.

The order to close gyms in Lake Bluff follows the closures of Lake Bluff village, park district and library facilities to the public.

Gov. JB Pritzker issued a disaster declaration on March 9 and subsequent emergency orders that mandated the statewide closure of all public and private schools, a ban on gatherings of 50 or more people and a restriction on dine-in service at bars and restaurants.

In Highland Park, Mayor Nancy Rotering ordered all health clubs, movie theaters and live performance venues closed by the end of the day Tuesday after declaring a state of emergency over the weekend.

Lake Forest has closed all city playgrounds and all non-essential municipal buildings, and fire department officials have asked residents to limit calls to 911 to true medical emergencies, according to an announcement from city staff. Emergency personnel and public health officials requested that those experiencing only mild symptoms stay home and try to avoid infecting others.

Dr. Sana Ahmed, medical epidemiologist at the Lake County Health Department, asked those showing mild COVID-19 symptoms — fever, coughing, shortness of breath — to distance themselves from others in their household and using a separate bedroom and bathroom when possible. Call a doctor if the symptoms worsen.

""We are prioritizing testing for symptomatic people who have high risk of complications — older adults living in congregate settings and those with chronic health conditions like heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, and those with weakened immune systems,"" Ahmed said in a release.

The moves are an effort to maximize social distancing practices, reduce the rate the coronavirus spreads in the general population and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed, a public health intervention often referred to as ""flattening the curve.""

O'Hara was joined behind the dais by Village Administrator Drew Irvin and Village Attorney Peter Friedman at Wednesday afternoon's emergency meeting. They maintained a distance of at least six feet, as recommended by public health officials, to minimize the risks of transmitting the virus to one another.



""The most important message is that our residents need to stay home,"" O'Hara said in a release announcing the emergency declaration.

Trustees were able to vote over the phone thanks to an executive order by the governor. The next Lake Bluff Village Board meeting is tentatively set for April 13.

Illinois,McHenry,43900.73611,https://patch.com/illinois/crystallake/il-coronavirus-mchenry-county-teen-among-new-cases,Coronavirus In IL: State Of Emergency Declared In McHenry County,"MCHENRY COUNTY, IL — McHenry County Board Chairman Jack Franks declared a state of emergency Wednesday for McHenry County in response to the county's first presumptive case of coronavirus, which activates the emergency operations plans of the McHenry County Department of Health and McHenry County Emergency Management Agency and requests state and federal funding and resources to combat a potential outbreak, according to a news release from government officials.

This declaration comes less than 24 hours after county health officials confirmed a teen tested positive at the Illinois Department of Public Health laboratory for coronavirus. According to the MCDH, the teen has no history of traveling to an affected area and isn't connected to anyone with a known case of COVID-19.

The teen is in isolation and doing well, health officials said, adding that they are identifying and investigating all who've been in contact with him.

Related: Coronavirus In Illinois: What You Need To Know For March 11

According to the government news release, Franks made the declaration upon the joint recommendation of county public health administrator Melissa Adamson and EMA director David Christensen.



""Declaring a state of emergency is not a decision to be made lightly,"" Franks said, in the news release. ""However, with a McHenry County resident now presumptively diagnosed with coronavirus, I have the responsibility to ensure that we can bring all available local, state and federal resources to bear to blunt the impact and bring this to as quick of a conclusion as possible.""

Marengo added that the declaration shouldn't cause panic or alarm and emphasized Gov. J.B. Pritzker's call for levelheadedness and calm while ""staying abreast of new developments and taking common-sense precautions.""

As for the county's first case, Adamson said they don't have much information currently, but are taking all necessary precautions with the case.

""We encourage all residents to continue using preventative measures to reduce the potential spread of COVID-19 and to begin planning for events that could disrupt their lives, such as school closures or if they become ill,"" Adamson said in the news release.



More:

County health officials said they will continue to partner with state and regional health departments to monitor all possible new cases as this situation continues to evolve. Residents should continue to use precautions (see below) in their daily routine to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus, and they should begin developing a plan should they become ill.

Quick tips for:

Everyone: Use the same daily health precautions you would for flu including washing your hands frequently, for a minimum of 20 seconds, using soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, covering your cough and sneeze, and staying home when sick.

Health care: Screen patients and visitors for symptoms of respiratory illness such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing; wear proper personal protective gear such as gowns and masks when needed, and have employees stay home when sick.

Day cares, schools, universities: Review emergency plans, absenteeism policies, and cleaning procedures; identify strategies for alternative learning mechanisms such as on-line programs; and consider postponing or cancelling student exchange programs.

Businesses: Review emergency and continuity of operation plans, revisit sick leave policies, and assess schedule flexibility.

Community and faith organizations: Review emergency plans and communicate with community members if events and services are changed, postponed, or cancelled.Get the latest

Meanwhile, Illinois' case count jumped from 7 cases to 19 cases since Friday as the illness spread outside Cook County.

More cases of coronavirus in Illinois include the first outside of Cook County, Pritzker said Tuesday, including a Kane County woman in her 60s. Like the McHenry County teen, the Kane County woman has no history of recent travel or contact with any other coronavirus patients, and does not work in healthcare, Pritzker said.



As another eight cases brought Illinois' coronavirus case count to 19, Illinois officials say there is growing evidence of community transmission — in other words, coronavirus spreading among those who haven't traveled to high-risk areas but contracted it at home.

On Tuesday afternoon, The City of Crystal Lake said they're actively monitoring the activities associated with the spread of coronavirus.



""The McHenry County Department of Health (MCDH) is the lead agency for infectious disease in McHenry County and the City is coordinating its efforts with their guidance along with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and IL Dept. of Public Health (IDPH),"" the City wrote in a Facebook post. ""The City has been monitoring the situation and has been in contact with MCDH, IDPH, State of Illinois, and federal agencies, to be informed of the most recent information available.""



The City also provided a list of local, national and worldwide health sources for residents to gather information from.

""The City has operational plans in place to ensure the delivery of essential City services should an outbreak occur in our community.""

Also on Tuesday, officials in McHenry County announced the relocation of polling places from Valley Hi Nursing Home and three other senior care facilities as a precaution to protect their residents from coronavirus.

According to the news release from McHenry County, officials decided to ""act proactively to move polling places for the Tuesday, March 17 primary from the county-owned Valley Hi and the three private facilities to alternate locations"" even while they believe the risk to the County remains low.

""It's out of an abundance of caution for a high-risk population, and following the recommendations of the IDPH and the CDC, Valley Hi requested that the polling location be moved at this time,"" Valley Hi Administrator Tom Annarella said, in the news release.

County Administrator Brian McFadden said the move will allow them to more quickly hire personnel or buy other equipment without having to wait for a county board meeting to approve it.

The county government oversees the Sangamon County Department of Public Health, which is coordinating with the Illinois Department of Public Health to respond to the outbreak.

“It's really designed for public health to be more responsive in these things,” McFadden said. He added that it sounds ominous, but mostly concerns internal processes.

“Those bureaucratic processes that are normally good are in place for transparency and accountability. But given these unusual times, we felt it was warranted,” he said.

He said the declaration is in place until the next county board meeting in a couple weeks, when the board can decide whether to extend it.

Meanwhile, Springfield city officials Tuesday night started the discussion about a state of emergency.

The proposal, which was added to the agenda just before the meeting, puts into place rules that would allow the mayor to call a state of emergency. That could include powers like instituting a curfew or halting the sale of alcohol.

The city council must first approve the rules, which could happen at an emergency meeting next Tuesday.

Mayor Jim Langfelder said he doesn’t intend to use the powers right away.

“We're at that point in time where we want to make sure that we have the ability to be nimble or flexible,” he said.

The council met in person Tuesday, but half the aldermen chose to call in. Three council members say they’ve been in contact with someone who has tested positive for covid-19 and are in self-quarantine.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker has continued to urge people to stay at home as much as possible, instituting bans on gatherings of more than 50 people and closing most restaurants and bars.

He also signed new rules this week that relax restrictions around electronic participation in public meetings, which make it easier for city councils or county boards to meet virtually.",disaster_declaration,199145

Haney signed the proclamation under Section 11 of the Illinois Emergency Management Act.

""This is a proactive measure often taken by communities after the Governor declares a statewide emergency,"" Haney said. ""This gives county officials another operational tool in continuing response efforts.""

This will enhance the County's ability to access resources, equipment, personnel and other necessities to address issues throughout the outbreak.

""The county's top priority is the safety of our residents,"" Haney said. ""I want to urge our residents to follow the guidance provided by the Winnebago County Health Department, the Illinois Departments of Public Heath and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" Chairman Haney said in a press release.

On Sunday, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Winnebago County by a resident in their 60s. Officials did not provide an update on his condition, but they did speak to the importance of testing.

""At this particular time there is no testing warranted for people who have not been exposed and do not have symptoms,"" Dr. Sandra Martell said. ""We need to get that message out, because again I think that this is a way we can protect our healthcare assets and resource.""",None,290666

He is the director of environmental health for the Boone County Health Department.

On the other side of Lebanon, at the county fairgrounds workers were cleaning up one of the biggest exhibition buildings. If needed this will become an emergency hospital.

If there is a coronavirus outbreak and the local hospital is overwhelmed, less seriously ill patients could be treated there.

“We can monitor their health to ensure people are getting the best care instead versus being at home,” Peppin said.

Fairgrounds facilities Manager Jack Jones never imagined he would be setting up a hospital.

“If we do everything the way we should and act with a little common sense, we will get through this.” he said.

But it won’t be easy. Peppin received two death threats from people angered by the government-imposed restrictions on business and services.

Wochit

BUCYRUS - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Crawford County commissioners have declared a state of emergency.

Commissioners voted on the resolution implementing the county's emergency plan following a Monday morning meeting with county department heads and elected officials.

The state of emergency is intended to enable the county to receive any state or federal funding that may become available, the resolution states. It increases the purchasing authority for costs related to the emergency to $100,000, with three informal estimates required.

Also Monday, Judge Sean Leuthold of Common Pleas Court issued an order closing the Crawford County Courthouse to employees as well as the general public on Fridays, with the exception of the board of elections office, which will continue to process absentee ballots. The courthouse was closed to the public last week.

Local response to Coronavirus: Bucyrus and Crawford County coronavirus cancellations and closings

""Any statutory deadline or limitation that occurs on a Friday, while the courthouse is closed, shall be extended to the following Monday,"" Leuthold's order states.

During the Monday meeting, Commissioner Doug Weisenauer explained that all elected officials would have to issue a declaration for their respective departments.

Leuthold led much of the discussion as the county leaders weighed options for issues raised by closing the courthouse, which county employees would be considered essential and required to work Monday through Thursdays and how they'd be compensated for time off.

Ultimately, each elected official will decide what happens in his or her department.

""We're all going to have to make some sacrifices; it can't be perfect,"" Sean Leuthold said. He suggested that department heads continue to come into the office on Fridays, saying that was what he intends to do.

For days when the courthouse is open, the possibility of rotating employees — having them work on alternate days — was discussed as an option for ensuring employees are treated fairly.

The consensus of the meeting was that county employees who are told not to report to work will be paid.

""The overriding public policy is as follows: Have less people here, but don't punish them economically,"" said Judge Shane Leuthold of Crawford County Municipal Court.

""This is an extraordinary situation, right?"" Sean Leuthold said. ""We're not going to be able to make sure every little tiny thing is going to be fair and equitable for every single person. There may be some employee who somehow doesn't get exactly what another employee gets. ... If we're going to try to craft a policy that does that, we're not going to get it done.""

Kate Siefert, commissioner of Crawford County Public Health, said the plan being discussed would meet the guidelines set forth by the Ohio Department of Health.

""There's not one-fits-all for any of this,"" she said. ""We are going to have factories that have to stay open and cannot meet social distancing. That's reality.""

In those cases, things such as hand-washing, the use of hand sanitizer and other measures become more important, she said. ""People that have to work just have to be more conscientious about it,"" she said.

She also urged county leaders to plan for essential employees to be absent at some point.

""If there is only one person that knows how to do your HVAC, you need to cross-train,"" she urged.

Indiana,Decatur,,https://www.wcmessenger.com/articles/decatur-declares-health-emergency/,Decatur declares health emergency,"The City of Decatur has declared a public health emergency related to COVID-19.

The city council Monday night approved a declaration of local disaster effective 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, March 24.

The declaration basically supports the disaster declaration approved by the county earlier on Monday while allowing the city to be able to control its own processes.

Notably, it echoes the county’s call to cancel gatherings of more than 10 people, based on CDC social distancing guidelines.

It also notes that city services required to maintain the health, safety and welfare of the public will remain open to the public, but facilities that are deemed not to provide essential services — the conference center and public library — will remain closed to the public until further notice.

The declaration also allows the mayor to direct the city manager to extend the time for payment of utility bills for those who provide documentation of hardship due to the virus.

Decatur city attorney Patricia Adams said it allows the city to take some steps to make sure they don’t have people’s water being cut off, for example.

“As we all know, people are losing jobs or being furloughed for a couple of weeks, and you certainly want them to keep their water for quality of life and so they can remain healthy,” she said.

Also, the declaration postpones all nonessential municipal court proceedings.

It also allows the city to cancel meetings for the remainder of March, April and May. However, since some council business will likely be required in that time frame, the mayor still has the authority to call a meeting when necessary.

Decatur Fire Chief Nate Mara, who is identified in the declaration as the city’s emergency management coordinator, said people need to understand the severity of the situation.

“We still run across people who are not taking this seriously,” he said. “To help keep our health system floating, people need to be taking it seriously.”

He said that while as of 5 p.m. Monday, Wise County did not have any confirmed cases of COVID-19, it’s important to do whatever we can to slow down the number of cases to flatten the curve so that the health care system does not become overwhelmed.

Decatur Police Captain Delvon Campbell said it is just a matter of time before Wise County has confirmed cases.

“I would be extremely surprised if this county does not have reports of it coming up soon, because I agree people are not taking it as serious as what they should be. Parking lots at places are still full. The reality is if we can just listen and abide by these declarations we could truly knock the curve down,” he said.

In separate COVID-19-related action, the council voted to postpone the May 2 city council election until Nov. 3.",state_of_emergency,26277
Indiana,DeKalb,43913.72153,https://www.theatlantavoice.com/articles/coronavirus-dekalb-county-ceo-declares-state-of-emergency/,Coronavirus: DeKalb County CEO declares state of emergency,"Monday morning, DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond formally declared a state of emergency then issued an executive order that prohibits public gatherings of 10 or more people, placing restrictions on local restaurants and other businesses, and enacted a voluntary curfew.

Under Thurmond’s executive order, residents are asked to “shelter in place as much as possible” and follow a “voluntary curfew” that will run from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. every day. Businesses deemed “non-essential” are also ordered to close during those hours. Effective Tuesday, public gatherings of 10 or more people will be prohibited and businesses like bowling alleys, gyms, fitness centers, nail salons, spas and other personal grooming facilities will be ordered to keep their occupancy below that threshold.

Restaurants, breweries and bars will be prohibited from offering dine-in service and restricted to take-out and delivery. They will also be allowed to sell unopened wine and beer for consumption off-site.

Thurmond also says, Workforce DeKalb “will immediately utilize $1.3 million to assist DeKalb workers dislocated from their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.”

“While COVID-19 is a serious threat to public health, we cannot ignore the realities of the economic fallout so many businesses and employees are experiencing,” Thurmond said in a news release. “We are experiencing parallel health and economic crises.”

What is not clear is if the City of Atlanta will institiute a voluntary curfew.

As of 1:00 PM, there are 41,026 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States. There are 772 confirmed cases in the state of Georgia.

Friday night, the city of Franklin declared a state of emergency because of the coronavirus.

Williamson County reported 35 cases of the virus as of Friday and the state announced its first death, a 73-year-old man in Davidson County.

""With this declaration effective tonight at midnight, the city is following in the footsteps of Governor Lee who declared a state of emergency for Tennessee,"" spokesperson Milissa Reierson said. ""This is a difficult but necessary decision to indefinitely close dining service inside restaurants and bars in Franklin. Gyms and fitness centers in the city limits will be closed as well. Salons and spas are urged to limit operations to comply with CDC guidelines. Church services are advised to be held virtually if possible.""

Mayor Ken Moore also advised those returning from a vacation during spring break to self-isolate and use physical distancing for 14 days, especially those who were in large crowds or flying.

“While this is a difficult and uncertain time, the only way to stop the spread and save lives is to take strong action now,"" Moore said. ""Williamson County currently has the second highest number of cases in the state of Tennessee. The safety and health of our community are the city’s top priority and we appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding during this time.""

Brentwood declares state of emergency

Brentwood also declared a state of emergency on Friday evening as of March 21 at 6 p.m.

This will include closing dining service and bars, plus gyms and fitness centers in the city limits.

""While this limits people from eating inside restaurants, there are a variety of ways residents can continue to support Brentwood restaurant businesses and employees,"" Mayor Rhea Little said. ""Please consider buying a gift card for dining later in the year, order take out, or even drop off a meal to a neighbor.""

Little also requests those returning from a vacation to self-isolate and use physical distancing for 14 days, especially those who were in large crowds or flying.

""As we strive to protect the most vulnerable in this fight against COVID-19, I encourage everyone to love and respect their neighbor by doing what is asked of us by medical experts and those trying to protect us individually and as a society,"" Little said.

Indiana,Harrison,,https://www.sunherald.com/news/coronavirus/article241405021.html,No curfew ordered yet in Harrison County,"Coast law enforcement agencies are recommending a two-week, 24-hour curfew starting Monday night, the city of Biloxi said.

A letter has been circulating on social media signed by Harrison County Sheriff Troy Peterson and police chiefs of Biloxi, Gulfport, Long Beach, Pass Christian and D’Iberville.

It recommends a curfew for two weeks, through April 6.

Mayor Andrew “FoFo” Gilich said the letter was “written for discussion purposes” and expects the issue to come up during a Harrison County Board of Supervisors meeting Monday morning, which he will attend.

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

Harrison County released a statement Saturday night, saying the Board of Supervisors has not yet discussed a curfew.

“There is no curfew,” a press release said. “The document that is being circulated on social media is apparently a suggestion created and signed by area law enforcement officials prior to presenting to the cities or county officials.”

Gulfport Mayor Billy Hewes’ office said in a Facebook post that law enforcement “in their zeal to underscore the critical nature of COVID-19 outbreak, put their recommendations in writing to Coast mayors.

“While the concerns are understood and appreciated, the Mayors rejected adopting those recommendations, favoring, instead, a more measured approach, reflected in yesterday’s actions,” the post said.

On Friday night, the health department recommended closing all bars and restaurant dining rooms, and Coast cities and counties enacted local resolutions enforcing it. The cities also shut down any indoor or outdoor gatherings of 10 people or more, and warned residents to use the six-foot rule and maintain social distance.

In the letter, law enforcement officials say exceptions to the proposed curfew would be public safety, healthcare and utility workers, grocery store and restaurant workers, and those in a “critical infrastructure industry” as defined by the Department of Homeland Security.

People would be allowed on the road between 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. only to seek medical attention, visit grocery stores, restaurants and pharmacies, or deliver items from those businesses.

Gilich said Biloxi is “asking people to limit travel to what is totally necessary, but there is no total lockdown of this city.

“If such a decision was made, including time, place and scope, it will be made by the mayor and City Council, with, I hope, all leaders across the Coast working in concert.”

The mayor told residents that limiting the spread of COVID-19 requires measures similar those taken for a hurricane — like states of emergency, emergency declarations, and curfews.

“That’s the best analogy for the public to remember,” Gilich said. “There’s no reason to be alarmed, or to overreact or underreact. This is just like preparing for a hurricane. Shelter in place.”

Gilich also mentioned spring break is “just around the corner.”

“I was hoping there could be some steps to limit the possibility of large groups gathering on the beach,” he said.

Harrison County said in the release public safety is a top priority, and the board is working daily with Emergency Management Agency officials.

The county, “strongly encourages the citizens of Harrison County to continue the social distancing protocols and strict sanitization guidelines set in place by the CDC and the Mississippi Department of Public Health in an effort to stop the spread of COVID-19.”",None,39163

City leaders met — several feet apart from one another — on Monday evening to unanimously declare a local emergency, approve a three-pronged emergency response plan and officially launch the next phase of that program.

The vote triggered the cancellation of all non-essential recreational services at city libraries and community centers. Library late fees and holds are suspended during the closure.

Huntington Beach already had suspended all library events through April 12.

Essential senior care services, including health checks, transit and meal services, will continue, according to the city’s new response website, HBready.com.

City Manager Oliver Chi added that the city will begin reassigning staff members from departments affected by closures to help serve residents considered more at risk of serious effects from the coronavirus-caused respiratory disease COVID-19 (those in their 60s or older who have preexisting health issues) and create new programs to address the growing problem.

“[Impacts of social distancing are] creating just unprecedented social upheaval right now,” Chi said. “There’s no way to mitigate those impacts, but the silver lining right now is all the different levers that government can try to influence are being pulled to try to mitigate the issues that people are experiencing.”

Following the lead of state and federal officials, Huntington Beach is asking the community to cancel gatherings of 250 or more people, or gatherings of 10 or more people by organizations that serve the higher-risk population.

The City Council’s discussion of specific responses to the coronavirus were punctuated with figures about the virus’s potentially devastating effects.

Fire Chief Scott Haberle said the Orange County healthcare system doesn’t have the capacity to deal with critical-care patients at the potential rate. About 15% of Orange County’s population of about 3 million is 65 or older, according to U.S. Census estimates as of July 1. But the number of staffed hospital and intensive care unit beds in the county amounts to about 5,500, Haberle said.

“The reality is, we can’t build more hospitals overnight,” Haberle said. “We really need to slow the spread of the disease going forward.”

Hotels and other tourist-oriented businesses that pay into the city’s transient occupancy tax are expected to see a sharp decline in revenue due to fewer people traveling — at least a 20% decrease in reservations over the next 3½ months, Chi projected.

Officials estimated a loss of $2.5 million to $3 million in the transient occupancy tax, plus $1 million to $1.5 million in sales taxes, for a total loss of $3.5 million to $4.5 million for the city.

“The local hotel industry in Huntington Beach is really one of the bedrocks of our local economy,” Chi said. “Those ripples go throughout our entire economy.”

The city has been in touch with the Small Business Administration to help local businesses access funding, Chi said.

As part of its response plan, the city also will cancel all work travel, not schedule events with more than 50 people and potentially cancel some commission and community support meetings. City staff also is meeting with community groups, such as the local interfaith council, to coordinate responses for higher-risk populations, Chi said.

“We kind of do what we’re doing here, so it’s not so much worried about us getting the flu or me getting the flu, it’s me transmitting it to somebody else who may not have the wherewithal to combat it,” Councilman Mike Posey said.

The state of emergency authorizes Jackson County to perform several actions, including the following:

Emergency procurement of goods and services.

Entering into mutual aid agreements between the County and cities within the County or neighboring counties.

Enforcing emergency measures to protect the public.

Modifying relevant personnel leave, personnel processes or policies, and workplace requirements, assignments, or designations of County employees.

Requesting assistance and potential reimbursements from the State of Oregon and any appropriate Federal agency for response and recovery.

Monroe County interim Public Safety/Emergency Management Agency Director Brian Meadows says four things are accomplished by declaring a countywide state of emergency.

1.) Monroe County EMA can activate its Emergency Operations Plan.

2.) Commissioners have the authority to waive procedures and establish curfews (although commissioners decided not to implement a countywide curfew at this point).

3.) Establishes a voluntary daily shelter in place policy between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. that will take effect beginning at 9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 25.

4.) Prohibits gatherings of 10 persons or more, including in local restaurants and churches. However, grocery stores, fuel stations, pharmacies and health and medical care facilities are excluded.

Exclusions to the voluntary shelter in place policy include:

5.) walking/running for physical exercise,

6.) traveling to procure food,

7.) traveling to seek medical attention,

8.) emergency services personnel executing this order,

9.) activities relating to agriculture, forestry and tending or caring for crops and livestock.

Meadows told commissioners he dislikes calling for emergency declarations because it’s indicative of a problem but that in this instance it’s in the county’s best interest to protect the lives of citizens and to reduce Coronavirus spread.

“Protection of life is the highest priority for limiting the effects of COVID-19,” Meadows said.

Monday’s resolution came nine days after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp declared a statewide public health emergency on March 14. Kemp is expected to hold a press conference at 5 p.m. Monday, March 23, during which further statewide restrictions could be implemented.

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a pandemic. Reported illnesses range from very mild to severe, including death.

Get more information at CDC.gov/coronavirus or contact the Tennessee Department of Health coronavirus information line at 877-857-2945 from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. CT daily.

On Monday afternoon, Montgomery County Mayor Jim Durrett and Clarksville Mayor Joe Pitts made an announcement to order residents to limit the size of social gatherings and restrict certain business operations.

It goes into effect Wednesday and will remain until April 1. The orders can be extended in seven day increments, according to the City of Clarksville press release.

“Many of you have already closed or altered your businesses to support these actions, and we are very grateful,” the mayors said in a joint statement. “This is an extremely difficult time for our County and City, especially for the business community. We are taking these steps because the sooner we stop the spread of the coronavirus, the sooner we can all get back to business.”

As of Monday afternoon, there were 615 positive cases of COVID-19 reported in the state, up from 505 on Sunday. Two people have died from the illness.

The orders declare a Civil Emergency and actions were made by both mayors to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic by limiting gatherings and in-person contact.

These orders do not apply to critical infrastructure as defined by Homeland Security, which includes industries such as health care services, pharmaceutical, food supply, utilities, information technology and public safety.

Under the orders:

Social gatherings of 10 or more people are prohibited.

In businesses that have a legal maximum occupancy of 50 people or less, occupancy shall be temporarily reduced to 10. Those businesses, buildings, facilities that have a legal maximum occupancy of 51 persons or more, should be temporarily reduced by one-half of their legal maximum occupancy.

Restaurants and bars are to offer drive-through, take-out or delivery options.

Restaurants and bars may sell alcohol by takeout or delivery (with the purchase of food) in closed containers to those who are age 21 and up.

Gyms and fitness centers are temporarily closed and in person services are suspended.

Under mayors' orders movie theaters, performing arts theaters, yoga studios, dance studios, bowling alleys and arcades are to close.

The mayors’ orders close to public access the common area or public space of indoor or enclosed shopping malls.

These orders also pursue additional measures to keep vulnerable populations such as those with underlying conditions and the elderly safe. Nursing homes, retirement homes,and assisted-living facilities is limited to visitation involving essential care only.

""Businesses are encouraged to enact policies that take extra steps to assist vulnerable populations by considering measures such as shopping hours exclusive from the general public,"" states the release.

City and county department heads are directed to be proactive and are authorized to take action pertaining to their departments to effect and enforce the orders to prevent spreading the COVID-19 disease.

While county and city park open spaces will remain open, recreation centers are closed. Residents using public open spaces should adhere to CDC guidance on social distancing and hand washing.

No order so far from state

Gov. Bill Lee on Monday continued to defend his decision not to implement a statewide ""stay-at-home"" order, as at least a dozen other governors have done in an effort to use their authority to prevent the spread of coronavirus from person to person.

While mayors in Nashville, Memphis, Tullahoma and Knox County are among the local governments in Tennessee that have issued such orders in recent days and called for non-essential businesses to close, Lee has instead urged the public to decide for themselves not to go out. He has, however, ordered restaurants only to serve food by takeout and ordered the closing of gyms.

""This is incredibly serious to this state, it's incredibly serious to the lives of Tennesseans,"" Lee said Monday. ""Every single Tennessean should wake up and take personal responsibility for saving the lives of the people around them and for saving the livelihood of their neighbors.""

(WTHR) – The Tippecanoe County Health Department Wednesday issued a public health alert to heighten awareness to the growing threat from COVID-19.

Health officials said some residents have already been tested for the virus and got answers to questions that people have been asking.

The Tippecanoe County Health Department tested a small number of people suspected of being sickened by COVID-19.

The results are in and all tests came back negative, according to County Health Officer Dr. Jeremy Adler.

“They are individuals who have traveled from areas of the world where coronavirus is more prevalent,"" Alder said.

He put the number at less than 10 and said all exhibited flu-like symptoms.

People have lots of questions about this new seemingly unstoppable virus.

For instance, can someone be infected with COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, not look or feel sick? The answer is yes.

However, Alder said, ""The spread of the illness by a symptomatic people, that is people who don’t show symptoms has not been a major factor in coronavirus.""

People who are sickened by COVID-19 virus receive a wide range of treatments.

“Anywhere from basic support care measures that one would use where one has the cold or flu, all the way up to hospitalization which would include oxygen, IV fluids and other sorts of general medical general support,” Alder said.

The illness can last one to two weeks.

How long are victims contagious?

“That is not known,” Adler said.

It comes on the heels of Gov. Bill Lee signing executive order No. 17 and is effective immediately.

“For the first time in Tipton County, we are now, likely, experiencing community transmission of the virus,” Huffman said. “This means that the virus is no longer only being transmitted from someone who has traveled outside the county. Considering that, I have taken these dramatic and unprecedented steps to keep the citizens of Tipton County safe.”

Under the new declaration and executive order, changes will be made to business operations, there are prohibitions for social gatherings and the county government has suspended some of its legally-required procedures.

What it means for the public and businesses

Lee’s order prohibits gathering in groups larger than 10 people. Blood drives are an exception to this.

His order also calls on businesses across the state to use alternative business models beginning at midnight CDT on Monday, March 23 until midnight CDT April 6. Businesses are encouraged to enact policies that take extra steps to assist vulnerable populations by considering measures such as shopping hours exclusive from the general public.

Both orders state restaurants should provide drive-thru, take-out and delivery services only. The county’s declaration does not mention this, but Lee’s order states establishments may sell alcohol by take-out or delivery (with the purchase of food) in closed containers to those who are age 21 and up.

Bars and gyms should close their facilities until further notice. Lee encourages gym owners to pursue digital programming if possible.

Visitation to nursing homes, retirement homes and long-term care or assisted-living facilities is now limited to visits involving essential care only.

“Additional closures may be required depending upon the results of further medical testing for this virus,” Tipton County’s declaration reads.

What it means for Tipton County government

The public health emergency declaration gives the county government, its departments and agencies the authorization to seek any and all necessary federal and state funding. It also suspends the regularly required procedures and regulations necessary to purchase equipment, materials, supplies and services needed for emergency management.

The Tipton County Emergency Management Agency is authorized to exercise all powers and authority granted to it by law.

It also states the county executive shall use all the resources available to the office to protect the health and welfare of the people of Tipton County.

“This virus is going to peak and then decline,” said Huffman. “We will get through this and my prayer is that once this emergency has passed, the people of Tipton County will swarm to local businesses to do their shopping and support the many, small, local businesses that have been devastated by this health challenge. Let’s just watch out for and take care of each other. If we do that, we will be fine.”

“I urge every Tennessean to take these actions seriously – our physical and economic health depend on this as we work to beat COVID-19,” said Lee.",state_of_emergency,15650

EVANSVILLE, Ind. — Seated about six feet apart from one another, the three Vanderburgh County Commissioners solemnly voted Monday to declare a State of Emergency due to the coronavirus spread.

The declaration, which has the force of the law, applies to the City of Evansville, as well. Mayor Lloyd Winnecke endorsed the move, citing public health officials' plea that citizens not congregate in large numbers.

City and county governments are following Gov. Eric Holcomb's newest order of limiting public gatherings to 50.

The declaration means the Civic Center is closed to the public. Government employees will still work, although some may do so offsite. Officials stressed local government is not closing, and many services are available online.

Other public facilities that will temporarily close include Mesker Park Zoo & Botanic Garden, Swonder Ice Arena, the Old Courthouse, Lloyd Pool, C.K. Newsome Center and Old National Events Plaza.

The State of Emergency also means local government officials can bypass some normal procedures if need be.

""This situation requires rapid decision-making,"" County Commissioners President Jeff Hatfield said. ""This declaration will allow this government to act in a very quick manner. Before county government would be very cumbersome and somewhat tied in its reaction time to this. This declaration will free us of that, and it's necessary for the public's health.""

The declaration is for seven days and may be renewed in seven-day increments as needed. After about 15 minutes, Monday's emergency meeting of County Commissioners was recessed, not adjourned.

State officials made clear Monday that community spread of coronavirus has arrived in Indiana, that it goes from person to person, and it's not always obvious where a person acquired the virus.

Vanderburgh County Health Officer Dr. Ken Spear told County Commissioners Monday that there's no vaccine for coronavirus and social distancing is needed to slow the spread.

Hatfield, Winnecke and others cited the need to follow the direction of Spear and health experts at the state level.

They noted Holcomb's decision to close restaurants and bars, except for carryout, to contain the virus.

Winnecke said it's reasonable to believe the virus exists in Evansville and Vanderburgh County, even though there has not been a confirmed positive test yet.

""I'm on daily calls with the health department as well as our two hospitals,"" Winnecke said. ""My understanding is they have a number of tests out to be examined. Not to speak on their behalf, but yes, I think it's safe to assume the virus is probably in our community. It's safe to assume that.""

Hatfield said it is important that businesses continuing to operate follow Occupational Health and Safety Administration guidelines to protect their employees.

Winnecke encouraged the public to continue to patronize local small businesses, and he asked the Southwest Indiana Chamber to help develop a list of restaurants with carryout availability.

""I still believe if we're calm and flexible, we will all prevail,"" the mayor said. ""These actions today, while somewhat dramatic, are meant to be precautionary.""

RICHMOND, Ind. — The message was repeated over and over again Friday by city, county and health officials: a surge of sick patients is going to hit our local health care system. Whether that surge arrives as a manageable wave or a disastrous tsunami depends on how cooperative citizens are in complying with new restrictions being put in place.

Richmond and Wayne County officials spent the day Friday debating how far to go with new directives aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus known as COVID-19.

""From 7:30 on until 5:30 today, we've been discussing Wayne County and the health of all the folks in Wayne County and how we keep the people in Wayne County safe,"" County Commissioner Ken Paust said. ""We've worked all day through this with all the parties ... to get to where we are this evening.""

They ultimately decided on an order that calls for citizens to cease ""all non-essential interaction"" and asks that employers reduce the number of people who normally would work in their buildings by 30 percent through remote or in-home work, among other measures.

►SUPPORT LOCAL COVERAGE OF CORONAVIRUS DEVELOPMENTS: The paywall on this story has been lifted in the interest of public safety and community knowledge. We ask you consider supporting local journalism with a subscription so we can continue our important work.

The joint executive order signed by the Wayne County commissioners — Paust, Mary Anne Butters and Denny Burns — and Richmond Mayor Dave Snow says:

All non-essential interaction such as social gatherings and the like should be eliminated;

Employers should move at least 30 percent of their normal in-building workforce to in-home or remote work;

Employers should permit those who are most at-risk for severe illness from the virus, including those of advanced age and/or who have underlying medical conditions, to self-quarantine; and

Businesses should increase social distancing among their workers and customers.

The order also says the mayor and commissioners will consult with the police and sheriff's departments about stepping up enforcement of the already-in-place Level 2 travel advisory, which limits citizens to essential travel only.

""What we're asking our enforcement division to do is to be available out there,"" Paust said. ""If you see excess people or if you see the same person just kind of joy-riding around town to stop that individual not to arrest that individual but say, 'Hey, we've got your name. We've got your license plate. We want you to go home.'""

Should developments surrounding the outbreak worsen, the order says ""additional, more restrictive directives may be forthcoming.""

""These will be in place until our health care professionals advise us otherwise, but public cooperation plays the number one role on when we get that advisement,"" Snow said.

The county health department also has asked funeral homes not to hold visitation and funeral services, eliminating one more type of event that might bring large groups of people together.

""I know that sounds shocking not having funerals,"" said Dr. David Jetmore, the county's public health officer. ""People will be interred, but there will not be a gathering of mourners there. We'll have to more than likely have the memorial service when this passes.""

The new restrictions come on the heels of Thursday's order from the health department shutting down tattoo parlors, salons, barber shops and more, businesses that feature close person-to-person interaction.

For days now, officials have been preaching the need for people to stay at home if at all possible, and there are signs that the lesson might be starting to sink in.

""Folks are beginning to listen to us, but they've got to listen even more,"" Paust said.

Officials stopped short of upping the travel advisory to a Level 3, which would prohibit all but emergency traffic. They also are loath to issue a ""shelter in place"" order.

""That would be the last thing that we want to do,"" Paust said.

""We don't want to close factories down. We don't close some of those mom-and-pop stores that are out there. But you have to help us all the way through.""

The steps being taken have one goal: to slow the spread of the virus, limiting the number of people who will get sick at the same time and preventing the health care system from being overwhelmed by a deluge of patients.

""We have enough for our needs right now in terms of protective supplies for our staff, but ... if we have a much larger number of patients than we have right now, then the rate of the use of those supplies is going to go way up and we will exhaust the supplies very quickly,"" said Dr. Thomas Huth, Reid Health's vice president of medical affairs.

Like a retreating shoreline can portend the coming of a tsunami, there are warning signs that a surge is fast approaching here.

""This week particularly we've seen a continuous ramp-up in focused activity to doctor's offices, to urgent care, to our emergency room with complaints of respiratory illness,"" Huth said. ""How much of this is COVID is not clear to us. There are certainly other viruses in the community, but I will say that it's a little bit unusual for this late in the winter season to see so much of the respiratory illness. We should be ramping down by now, and we're not doing that.""

Making it harder to get a clear understanding on the current situation is the lack of available testing kits. Reid Health has 100 on hand, and so care must be taken in how those resources are used.

""We have to conserve those for the highest-risk patients where we need to know to make decisions in their care and then also to prioritize to make sure that we keep our health care workers healthy and on the job,"" Huth said.

There also are problems at the state level with testing, according to Huth. The Indiana State Department of Health's ability to process the tests is limited, so it rations the testing at the local level.

""We frequently have situations where we're uncertain about whether a patient could have COVID and we ask the state for a test and that is denied because it doesn't meet their criteria,"" he said.

And then there's the uncertainty in the results from the tests themselves.

""The sensitivity on these has been reduced,"" Reid Health CEO/President Craig Kinyon said. ""If you're positive, you're probably positive. If you're negative, you may be negative.""

As of 5 p.m. Friday, Reid had tested 35 patients, with three coming back presumptive positive, nine negative and the other 23 pending.

A presumptive positive means the initial test by the state department of health is positive. The test then is sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.

There was hope that a needed boost to the cache of local protective equipment was coming Friday from the federal government, but what actually was received was a disappointment.

""We were notified earlier this morning that the Strategic National Stockpile had been released to Wayne County, so we staged to pick it up with a forklift ... and we had enough to fit in the cab of a truck,"" said Christine Stinson, the executive director of the county health department.

Officials repeatedly pleaded for the public to heed the restrictions now in place at the state and local levels, emphasizing the importance that cooperation will have on how successfully the coming tide can be stemmed.

""We're not prepared for the magnitude that we're seeing overseas for critically-ill patients, so the declaration is geared toward slowing down the interactions, reducing the exposures,"" Kinyon said.

""These aren't things that we're doing lightly. They are actions that are really geared toward the protection against spreading a disease that's very unknown and we have no real tools to combat it.""

Huth pointed to people's sense of the greater good, a collective call to make sacrifices so as to protect those most vulnerable in the community.

""We all have a responsibility to each other to take care of ourselves, be responsible for ourselves and be accountable for our own actions so that we don't accidentally hurt other people,"" he said.

Although it's hard to know when the outbreak will have abated, Jetmore said such a time is indeed in our future.

""There will come a day when you will not read or hear about coronavirus except in a historical context,"" he said, ""so hang in there, fellow citizens.""

Whitley County Judge-Executive Pat White, Jr. signed an order Friday declaring a state of emergency in the county.

While the measure does grant White, as the local chief executive officer, a number of additional powers as such as the power to establish curfews, to prohibit or limit the sale or consumption of goods, and to seize, take or condemn property, White said the sole purpose of the declaration was to make federal and state resources available to first responders, medical personnel and the hospital.

Specifically, White said it will permit officials to request triage tents should the number of coronavirus cases overwhelm Baptist Health Corbin’s capacity.

“It would only be in the event there was dire need,” White said.

“I’m not taking any action on any increased authority at this point,” he said.

White took similar action following the heavy flooding across the area in February.

As of Tuesday, 25 people across Kentucky have been diagnosed with the coronavirus with one fatality.

The cases are in Jefferson, Fayette, Bourbon, Harrison, Nelson, Clark and Montgomery Counties.",state_of_emergency,33294

The Allamakee County Board of Supervisors met in regular session Monday, March 9 to address a full agenda of items including the consideration of a road embargo resolution, a cooperative agreement for a new federal competitive highway bridge program project and a review of the County’s insurance coverage.

During Public Comment, Jack Knight briefly discussed several matters including the fact that the community of Clermont is exploring the potential use of traffic cameras, Fayette County has spent more than anticipated on gravel and that the Postville City Council will be discussing planning and preparedness relating to the coronavirus.

The Supervisors moved into the Liquor License Renewal for the Old Rossville Store with Board Chairperson Larry Schellhammer and Supervisors Dan Byrnes and Dennis Koenig approving this request.

Allamakee County Sheriff Clark Mellick addressed the next agenda item relating to a request to use the County credit card by the Sheriff’s Department. Mellick discussed the annual fee associated with the GoToMeeting video conferencing service necessary for arraignments and attorney communications at the Public Safety Center jail. The Supervisors approved the ongoing use of the County credit card to pay for the annual video conferencing fee.

The Fiscal-Year 2019 First Judicial District Department of Correctional Services Financial Report was accepted and placed on file.

The Board of Supervisors adjourned and reconvened as the Board of Canvassers to address the next matter relating to the canvass of the MFL/MarMac School District special election. Allamakee County Auditor Denise Beyer provided an overview of the special election results indicating that the bond measure did not pass with 60% voter approval being required, which was not met. Beyer provided an overview of the Allamakee County portion of the election results, reporting there were 33 votes received for the bond measure and 41 against within the total of 74 votes cast. The Board of Canvassers accepted the results of the special election and adjourned, with the Board of Supervisors then reconvening.

Beyer discussed the next agenda item relating to a County Auditor’s Office personnel matter. Beyer indicated that Accounting Clerk Karmen Piggott’s six-month probationary period has ended as of March 3 and provided a recommendation to increase Piggott’s current wage of $17.25 per hour to $18 per hour. The Supervisors approved Piggott’s salary increase as of March 3.

Allamakee County Engineer Brian Ridenour provided an overview of the Embargo Road Resolution agenda item, indicating that a majority of asphalt roads are being requested for embargo to include five-ton single axle and seven-ton tandem axle. Ridenour indicated that warmer temperatures and moisture saturation of the sub-base due to frost melt make the embargo necessary and that he has coordinated with Winneshiek County to set the road embargo for the same week. The Embargo Road Resolution was approved.

Ridenour discussed setting a date for a public hearing for vacating a portion of old County Road No. 527, indicating that this road is not Power Plant Drive but rather a dead end, 800-foot extension of that road. Ridenour provided a recommendation to set April 6 at 10 a.m. for the public hearing on this matter, which was approved by the Supervisors. Byrnes further clarified that this is a Class C road on private property.

The Supervisors moved into the consideration of a Cooperative Agreement for a Competitive Highway Bridge Program (CHBP) Project with Bremer County. Ridenour discussed that this is a new Federal program providing aid and allowing a county to bundle bid letting with another county. Ridenour indicated that this competitive highway bridge program funding is made possible through the Division L of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which appropriated $225,000,000 to be awarded by the United States Department of Transportation for a competitive highway bridge program for replacement or rehab of bridges. Ridenour advised that one bridge in Allamakee County qualified for this program and is located on B25 (Lansing Harpers Road) over Cota Creek. The Supervisors approved to enter into a cooperative agreement with Bremer County.

Ridenour explained that Federal agreements are coordinated through the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) and that the bridge project on B25 (Lansing Harpers Road) over Cota Creek has a preliminary estimated cost of $700,000 with approximately $382,000 (55%) of that cost being paid by federal aid. The Supervisors approved the Federal aid agreement.

Jane Regan with Upper Iowa Insurance Services provided an overview of Allamakee County’s insurance coverage relating to the County Courthouse and Public Safety Center. Regan discussed specific coverage areas including inland marine, business auto, workers’ compensation and liability coverage. Regan provided an overview of the County’s annual premium and advised that the County has adequate and appropriate coverage limits.

Under Department Head Updates, Ridenour indicated that the Secondary Roads Department is busy with brush cutting, with two motorgraders also out grading roads to repair rough spots. Ridenour also reported that applications are being received for two vacancies in his department until March 12.

Ridenour provided an update on the Health Insurance Committee’s recent meeting with a five percent increase to health insurance premiums being likely. He said a recommendation will be made at the next Supervisors meeting.

Allamakee County Environmental Health Director Laurie Moody discussed that she has viewed new building sites, building expansions and well sites and provided an update on upcoming absences due to training sessions.

Allamakee County Emergency Management Coordinator Corey Snitker discussed planning and preparedness relating to the coronavirus. Snitker indicated that a two-day hazardous material operations course is scheduled for this weekend in Waterville, allowing firefighters to attain a hazardous material response certification. Snitker discussed the flood forecast for this year and that a flood meeting is scheduled in Scott County.

Beyer discussed the MFL/MarMac special election and that the budget public hearing notice is being published in this week’s newspaper (see Page 2B). Beyer discussed being proactive and planning for scenarios relating to staffing and the coronavirus with a virtual private network (VPN) being an option she will be looking into to allow quarantined employees to work from home.

Prior to adjournment, Koenig discussed that County Social Services (CSS) views a proposed one-percent sales tax increase as an opportunity to decrease the use of property tax dollars and provide funding for mental health. Koenig advised that state representatives should be contacted in support of this measure.

Ohio, Louisiana and Delaware became the latest states on Sunday to announce statewide stay-at-home orders as the toll from the coronavirus outbreak grew to more than 31,000 cases and 390 deaths.

With the announcements, more than 101 million Americans are either currently under — or will soon be under — state orders to remain at home in an effort to slow the outbreak. That is equal to roughly 31% of the nation's population.

In addition to Delaware, Louisiana and Ohio, similar policies are either in place or will soon take effect in California, Connecticut, Illinois, New Jersey and New York.

The United States now has the third-largest number of confirmed cases, behind China and Italy, respectively. As testing capabilities expanded over the past week, the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. continued to climb.

Facing a surge in cases, the Ohio Department of Health and Gov. Mike DeWine signed a statewide stay-home order for the state's 11.7 million residents. The order requires residents to remain in their homes until at least April 6, but allows exceptions for activities like buying groceries or to seek out medical care. The state has reported 351 confirmed cases and three deaths.

""We are now at a new stage,"" DeWine said on Twitter.

In Louisiana, home to a population of 4.6 million, Gov. John Bel Edwards followed suit, with stay-at-home measures effective Monday at 5 p.m.

Louisiana has reported 837 cases and 20 deaths.

""Bottom line is we're in a race against time when it comes to this coronavirus and its rapid spread in Louisiana,"" Edwards said at a press conference Sunday.

In Delaware, Gov. John Carney ordered residents to stay at home and closed all non-essential businesses starting Tuesday.

""This was not an easy decision, but it's the right decision to protect the safety of Delawareans and Delaware families,"" Carney said.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont announced a ""Stay Home, Stay Safe"" order for that state on Saturday.

So too did New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy. There are more than 1,000 cases of COVID-19 in New Jersey and 16 people have died, according to the state's website.

In a video, the governor said all gatherings should be canceled, including weddings, funerals and birthday parties.

""I don't take this action lightly, but my goal is to make sure you can gather safely with family and friends later,"" Murphy said.

Murphy ordered all nonessential retail businesses to indefinitely close their physical stores to the public at 9 p.m. Saturday. Essential businesses, including grocery stores, pharmacies, restaurants offering takeout and delivery, banks, gas stations and other limited exceptions, are allowed to stay open.

""You can still take a walk outside, go buy groceries or get takeout from the local restaurant you want to support. But if you do, continue to practice social distancing,"" Murphy said. ""But otherwise we need you to stay at home. This is no time for business as usual.""

In a tweet, Murphy urged residents not to go to their Jersey Shore beach homes and instead stay at their primary residences.

""The local infrastructure, especially the health care infrastructure, is not prepared for the influx of part-time residents,"" Murphy said.

Italy's grim milestone

Worldwide, confirmed total cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, surpassed 300,000 worldwide over the weekend, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Italy has reached a grim milestone with its death toll — now exceeding 4,800 deaths, which is larger than the death count reported in China, where the disease was first diagnosed.

In response to the record-setting numbers, Italy is shutting down all production facilities except those essential to maintaining the nation's supply chain.

In the northern Lombardy region, one of the worst-affected areas in Italy, officials took more extreme steps on Sunday, ordering all guests out of hotels, which will now be used only for emergency purposes, and banning all outdoor sports and exercise activities.

Cownie signed the proclamation Sunday, less than a day after Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds announced the state's first case of ""community spread"" of the novel coronavirus. The designation means COVID-19 has spread from an unknown source and isn't linked to travel.

Reynolds announced the case was linked to Dallas County, which includes Des Moines' western suburbs. In a news conference Sunday, Cownie said that case ""opened a lot of people’s eyes.""

""That, I think, steps it up to a level we should all be concerned about: how we gather, where we gather and to respect that social distancing that we all should have,” he said.

The proclamation forces the cancellation of the 2020 St. Patrick's Day Parade, which was scheduled to close several streets downtown Tuesday during working hours.

A block party on Court Avenue, hosted annually by Annie's Irish Pub, was also planned for Tuesday, but the bar decided earlier Sunday that it would postpone the party.

The Des Moines Public Library system, citing Cownie's declaration, announced Sunday it would close all six of its locations until further notice. It urged patrons to continue to access resources through its website, https://www.dmpl.org/.

“All indications are that aggressive early social distancing can stop this virus from spreading exponentially, and we believe the library has a responsibility to play a role in that here in Des Moines,” library director Susan Woody said in a statement.

Cownie estimated the proclamation could remain in place for at least a couple weeks and last up to two months. He referenced the 1918 flu pandemic, saying cities that enacted social distancing quickly fared better than those that didn't.

“I think we have to be very careful with this,” he said.

Those who paid for event permits to hold their events on public land can get refunds upon request, according to the proclamation.

The fifth-term mayor urged residents to also avoid large gatherings on private property. (The declaration doesn't ban gatherings of 250 or more people on private land.)

He also cautioned people who might want to go to a local bar or restaurant to enjoy the St. Patrick's Day holiday. Over the weekend, revelers across the country still went out to bars and nightclubs despite the spread of the virus.

“I’d suggest they hopefully respect the health and well-being of their friends and associates and anyone they come in contact with. I would think they would want to maintain this social distancing for their own health and well-being,” he said.

There are 18 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in Iowa, though none so far is in Des Moines or Polk County.

The mayor added that the city is working on how the coronavirus could affect city services. Police, fire and garbage services will still continue.

“Those people, they can’t telecommute to work,"" he said. ""They need to be on hand.”

Parade canceled for first time

After holding off on canceling the annual Des Moines St. Patrick's Day Parade, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of Central Iowa's board voted Sunday morning to forgo the annual tradition.

Tony Schmid, president of the group, said 2020 is the first time the parade has been canceled since it was founded in the 1980s. He didn't rule out holding it at a later date.

“This is definitely the first time we’ve canceled it, and we’re very sad to do so,” he said at the city's news conference Sunday.

Schmid added that the majority of people who reached out to him wanted the parade to go on. However, he was only expecting 1,000 attendees, at most, because of the virus and the potential for rain. On a nice day, Schmid said 20,000 to 30,000 will line the streets.

Although other similar events were canceled or postponed nationwide earlier in the week, the parade was still on schedule. Schmid was talking with both the city and the governor's office, hoping to hold off as long as possible for better news.

“We were ready to pull the plug at the very last minute if it was left up to us, but we decided, as the group, that we didn’t want to move forward with it,” he said.

He and the mayor then offered up their closing remarks in a mostly empty City Hall. Moments later, a city employee appeared with disinfectant wipes to clean off the city's video equipment.

The Linn County Board of Supervisors passed temporary employment policies for the county’s workers on Monday, including paid leave, as a result of COVID-19.

The temporary policy also ensures “the continuity of Linn County government services.” Most county buildings have closed to the public, but people can contact Linn County departments by phone or email. Some employees will have the option to work from home.

The measures taken by Linn County are consistent with recommendations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Under the new policy, county employees will not be required to use their accrued sick leave or other accrued paid leave under certain conditions relating to COVID-19, including:

• If an employee tests positive for COVID-19 and must therefore stay home per their doctor’s and/or Iowa Department of Public Health’s orders.

• If an employee is quarantined per their doctor’s, Iowa Department of Public Health and/or the Center for Disease Control orders due to suspected exposure with COVID-19

• If an employee has been exposed to someone who has the virus and needs to be tested.

• If an employee is needed to care for a family member who has the virus or has been in contact with someone who has the virus.

• If an employee has traveled to an area that is on a restricted travel list (domestic or international) in effect on the planned date of return.

The employee will remain on paid status for up to 14 calendar days if the above criteria is met.

There are circumstances where employees will be required to use their accrued sick leave, but it is expected this will only be until Wednesday, March 25.

“On April 2, the federal law is requiring that employees meeting the circumstances currently in our Section VII be employer paid and not required to use their own sick leave,” Linn County spokesperson Joi Alexander said in an email. “Linn County’s HR director is recommending the Board of Supervisors approve this change for County employees on Wednesday instead of waiting until April 2 out of an abundance of caution and concern for the safety and health of the County government workforce.”

The circumstances currently not covered by paid leave but would be if the board passes the recommendation include:

• An employee showing potential virus symptoms or and who has consulted with a health care provider and submits proof of such consultation.

• An employee who chooses to self-isolate due to an underlying health condition or age, or that of a spouse or dependent, and submits a recommendation for the self-isolation from a health care provider.

• An employee who needs to stay home to care for a family member due to the closing of a school or child/adult daycare. An employee choosing this option may be subject to callback in order to maintain minimum staffing levels at 24/7 operations and county-designated essential services.

The resolution passed 4-1, with commissioner Ed Myer dissenting.

While four of the five voted for the approval, not all were completely in agreement. Commissioner Dan Woydziak did it but felt obligated to do so.

""I’ll vote for the resolution because we’re forced into a corner where we have no choice,"" Woydziak said.

With the state’s decisions of declaring a state of emergency last week and then with Governor Laura Kelly closing the state’s school buildings on Tuesday, the board met on Thursday morning to address the pressing need of a declaration for the county.

The declaration comes six days after a Butler County man tested positive for COVID-19 and two days after Sedgwick County declared an emergency. More than 10 counties in Kansas have issued their own declaration of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

With the declaration, the board also unanimously passed closing all county owned and operated buildings to the public, with the exception by appointment.

The declaration is from Monday, March 23 through Friday, April 3. The two weeks according to the board will give the county time to assess the needs of those within the county and determine what are the next steps needed to move forward.

""There will be employees that we have to address that have compromised health,"" County Administrator Will Johnson said. ""We'll have employees that are truly fearful. We have to have compassion for them.""

With the declaration, the county also moved to limit events with 50 or more people. There are certain restrictions according to the board that apply to the detention center as well.

""I’m looking for evidence of 50 people or less in the detention facilities,"" board member Jeff Masterson said. ""That function will have to continue.""

For county employees, they are eliminating all out-of-state and out-of-county, with the exception of Sedgwick County travel has been canceled.

""We’re going to keep everyone home right now,"" Johnson said.

All future board meetings will be held without the general public in attendance. To comply with the Kansas Open Meetings Act, all meetings will be streamed via the county website.

""They don’t have to participate in the meetings,"" Johnson said. ""As long as they can view, we’re in line with KOMA.""

The discussion of furloughing county employees was approved. However, how those employees will be paid is still being discussed.

Story updated at 4:51 p.m. Wednesday

Douglas County’s health officer has ordered all restaurants, dining facilities, bars, taverns, night clubs and movie theaters closed to the public as a proactive social distancing measure in light of the spreading coronavirus.

In his order Wednesday afternoon, the health officer, Dr. Thomas Marcellino, also prohibited public gatherings of more than 10 people. Both measures will be in effect until at least April 1, according to a news release from Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health.

“It is incredibly important during this time for people to limit their gatherings to less than 10 people as we try to flatten the curve of the spread of this virus and for people to avoid non-essential community engagement and non-essential trips out of their homes,” Marcellino said in the release.

As of 3 p.m. Wednesday, Douglas County had one confirmed case of COVID-19, though health officials around the country expect numbers to increase in the coming days.

Restaurants will still be permitted to provide drive-thru, pickup and delivery services. These are the same restaurant restrictions that health officers in Johnson and Wyandotte counties enacted earlier this week.

“We want to limit environments where people have a greater chance of congregating in a crowd of more than 10 people,” Marcellino said. “We appreciate the work and cooperation of all business owners as we seek to work together to limit the spread of the virus and especially protect those who might be most vulnerable.”

The order to prohibit gatherings larger than 10 people relates to both indoor and outdoor gatherings. It does not restrict governmental and judicial functions, health care facilities, private business operations, religious and faith-based activities, weddings and funerals.

Many Lawrence restaurants had already shut down their dine-in services before Wednesday’s order.

On Tuesday around mid-day, 41 downtown restaurants and businesses on Massachusetts Street in Lawrence had signs up announcing they were either closing or restricting service to takeout and delivery because of the outbreak. Other restaurants, however, remained open.

The City of Lawrence and Douglas County, the local courts and other exempted organizations, including many churches, had also already moved to limit or ban gatherings in their buildings.

On Tuesday, the county health department had ordered an eight-week halt to gatherings of 50 people or more, and it “strongly” recommended against gatherings with more than 10 people for the same period. By Wednesday afternoon, “known community transmission” had been identified to the east in Johnson County, which had at least 11 confirmed cases, according to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. The state as as whole had 21 confirmed cases as of 2:30 p.m., although KDHE said that testing would begin to be limited to only the most serious cases in Johnson County, given the widespread nature of the virus there and the potential strain on laboratories and hospital resources.

Patients in Douglas County who have symptoms — difficulty breathing, cough and fever — and are seeking medical attention should call their health care provider first before showing up at any medical offices. Patients without a health care provider may call the Lawrence Douglas-County health department’s coronavirus line, 785-856-4343.

Snow and rain are expected to hit the roads at the same time as holiday traffic on major highways Thursday morning.

Snow accumulations could range from 3 to 8 inches in northwest and west-central Kansas starting Wednesday night, the warning says, with the hardest-hit areas getting up to 12 inches. Coupled with rain, snow on the roads could create a dangerously slick situation for drivers.

Rain and heavy snow are expected on Wednesday night and throughout the day on Thursday, the warning says.

Almost a quarter-inch of ice could accumulate on the roads. Snow blowing across the roadways in 30- to 40-mph gusts could ""significantly reduce visibility,"" the warning says.

It is important to be prepared when we see a winter event like this approaching, and we appreciate our emergency responders who stand ready to provide any aide that may be needed,"" Colyer said in a news release. ""We hope that travelers will be wise by paying attention to weather alerts and not unnecessarily placing themselves in harm's way as the storm moves through.""

Finney County is under a winter weather advisory for Wednesday and Thursday, as well as area counties, Lane, Scott, Wichita, Grant, Greeley, Hamilton, Kearney Stanton, Grant and Greeley.

Cheyenne, Decatur, Gove, Graham, Logan, Morton, Norton, Rawlins, Sheridan, Sherman, Stevens, Thomas, Wallace counties are also under advisory.

The winter storm is also expected to hit east-central and northeast Colorado and southwest Nebraska, the warning says.

Colyer's State of Emergency declaration frees up funds and personnel to assist with response to storm. The Kansas Division of Emergency Management will monitor the storm. Portions of central and eastern Kansas are expected to receive rain.

""Although blizzard-like conditions are not currently expected, increased winds could cause blowing snow, creating visibility issues,"" said Angee Morgan, director of the emergency management division.

""Just the same, road conditions may become snow packed and icy. Kansans are urged to change or delay their travel plans if possible in these areas until the storm moves through.""

Air travelers should check with their airlines to monitor delays and cancellations near departure time.

To keep up with road conditions before traveling in inclement weather, here are some tips and resources provided by the Kansas Division of Emergency Management:

— Winter road conditions in Kansas are accessible by dialing 5-1-1 from your mobile phone anywhere in the state; outside Kansas call 1-866-511-5368 (KDOT). Road conditions may also be viewed on the Kansas Department of Transportation web site at http://kandrive.org.

Statewide, State Health Officer Scott Harris has issued orders prohibiting on-site restaurant dining and non-work gatherings of more than 25 people that cannot maintain a consistent 6-foot distance between people.

Law enforcement officials can issue misdemeanor citations for people who violate the state health officer's orders against large public gatherings, Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said.

Marshall on Saturday issued guidance to law enforcement agencies, saying they have the authority to issue citations to people who refuse to comply with the orders, although he urged restraint in doing so.

“While the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the government’s evolving response seem to demand some restraint related to criminal enforcement of this order, if a violator has been made aware of the state health order and the refusal to comply presents a threat to public health and safety, the penalties of (the law) are available as an enforcement tool,"" Marshall wrote.

Marshall said a person found guilty of violating an order of the State Board of Health shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, would be fined between $25 and $500.

The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.

(KSNW) – The Humane Society of the United States, says it is helping the Kingman County Sheriff’s Office remove close to 30 dogs from a property in Kingman County.

In a press release, the Humane Society of the United States says the sheriff’s office served a search warrant at a rural home south of Kingman at 8 a.m. Wednesday. The Kingman County sheriff was still on the scene Wednesday afternoon.

The organization says some of the dogs appear to be suffering from skin conditions and possible neglect.

It says the sheriff’s office requested the assistance of the Humane Society of the United States.

Other organizations that are helping are Beauties and Beasts, Kansas Horse Education, Advocacy and Resource Team, and Kingman Humane Society.

The owner of the animals contacted KSN to say his wife’s health is failing. He says he has not been able to keep up with cleaning the kennels daily, but he says the dogs have plenty of food and water.

Osage County Sheriff’s deputies wait inside the entrance of the county courthouse to check the medical conditions of all visitors and employees.

LYNDON, Kan. – With conditions seemingly changing by the minute, Osage County has joined other counties across Kansas in declaring a public health emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. At a special meeting called March 17, 2020, Osage County commissioners also took action to limit access to the courthouse and conduct a health screening of all who enter, including employees.

Also Tuesday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced the state’s efforts against the virus will include the closure of the state’s school buildings for the remainder of the school year and ordered that group gatherings across the state be limited to no more than 50 people in a single area.

Osage County’s emergency declaration followed the state’s declaration of March 12, and once enacted it authorizes the activation of the county’s local emergency response plan.

At Tuesday’s special commission meeting, with most of the county department heads in attendance, Osage County Health Department Director Jackie Patterson, who is also the county’s health officer, outlined then current statistics on coronavirus cases in the U.S. By March 18 the total had risen to 7,038 total cases in the U.S. with 97 deaths; and in Kansas, 21 positive test results and one death.

Patterson reported Tuesday there was one person under investigation from Osage County.

“This is a person who has been identified as someone who qualifies to be tested,” Patterson told the commissioners. “As of this morning, we still don’t have the results back.”

She explained that although testing for the virus was now underway in the U.S., it could take several days to get results back.

Patterson said the Osage County resident and her family are under a 14-day quarantine. She said the reason the person was tested was because they had traveled.

“We don’t have any local spread yet,” Patterson said, noting no known positive cases in Osage County at that time.

Commissioners considered the feasibility of closing the courthouse temporarily or limiting access, and all nodded in agreement with Patterson that the courthouse should stay open for public business as long as it was possible.

“We still have to run our county and we still have people that need services, and we still have people that need things,” Patterson said.

After discussion about how to limit access, commissioners decided entry to the courthouse would only be through the west entrance and it would be monitored by a sheriff’s deputy.

“They would possibly do a quick health screen like take your temperature and just make sure we don’t have somebody coming in that’s noticeably sick,” Patterson said. “Might ask them a couple of questions, have you been to – have a specific list of places that might be hot beds right now.”

Osage County Commissioner Ken Kuykendall asked Sheriff Laurie Dunn if she had officers available to man the courthouse door.

“I will,” Dunn said. “We will get it done, if that’s what we’re going to do.”

“I thought it was a good idea last week,” Dunn said. “I shut my buildings down last week, just for those purposes, the number of people coming into my buildings, I have small lobbies.”

Buildings under Dunn’s responsibility include the jail and sheriff’s office. She later told Osage County News that the front door of the sheriff’s office is now locked and any visitors will need to ring a doorbell and wait for an officer to let them in.

“There comes a point when I have to protect my employees,” Dunn said.

Regarding the courthouse screening, Dunn said, “Everybody is going to have to go through it. Every time you go smoke, you’re going to have to take the long trip, and I know that upsets courthouse employees.”

By Tuesday afternoon, commissioners had implemented the screening process for courthouse visitors, with two deputies stationed a few feet inside the west courthouse door armed with an oral and forehead thermometer and a jug of hand sanitizer.

Kuykendall also questioned Patterson about guidelines for local restaurants and churches.

Patterson said she was recommending everyone follow the national guideline of congregating in groups of less than 10 people.

Concerning restaurants, “Right now we’re not going to close them down,” Patterson said. “Most of our restaurants are pretty small. Most of times they don’t have 10 people except during rush hour. Most times they don’t have 10 people within close proximity with each other.

“As long as we can prevent any of that (groups of more than 10), I will let them monitor themselves,” she said.

“Right now we don’t have a positive case, as soon as we do that, we will reevaluate,” Patterson said.

She offered the same recommendation for churches – meet in groups less than 10 people only.

Patterson said she expected her office to be hectic soon and asked if Osage County Clerk Rhonda Beets could assist her as a public information officer during the health emergency. Beets agreed and the two noted they would be setting up a Facebook page to provide pandemic information that pertains to Osage County.

Later Tuesday, Beets issued a press release that outlined the public health emergency and said the county health department would be monitoring the COVID-19 outbreak and is working with Kansas Department of Health and Environment and other Osage County agencies to manage the situation.

The release also offered these recommendations to all Osage County residents:

All people over the age of 60 and those with underlying health concerns should take all precautions to self-protect. Consider avoiding social gatherings. If you have a fever, cough, shortness of breath or other medical issues that can be addressed over the phone, contact your healthcare provider before going to the office or emergency room.

Inside events that have over 10 attendees should be cancelled.

Take these common steps to avoid contracting COVID-19, Influenza A and B, and the seasonal cold.

Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.

Avoid touching your face and cover your face when coughing or sneezing.

Refrain from personal contact with other people.

Socially distance yourself from large gatherings of people.

Utilize disinfectant products on common surfaces if you have to be out (such as a grocery cart).

Utilize hand sanitizers when hand washing is unavailable.

Wednesday morning, county commissioners agreed to hold special meetings at 8:30 a.m. daily Monday to Saturday, until further notice.

Kansas,Rawlins,,https://www.thefencepost.com/news/usda-designates-rawlins-county-kansas-as-a-primary-natural-disaster-area/,"USDA designates Rawlins County, Kansas, as a primary natural disaster area","WASHINGTON — Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue designated Rawlins County, Kansas, as a primary natural disaster area. Producers who suffered losses due to excessive rain, flash flooding, flooding, high winds, and hail that occurred between Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, 2019, may be eligible for U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency emergency loans.

This natural disaster designation allows FSA to extend much-needed emergency credit to producers recovering from natural disasters. Emergency loans can be used to meet various recovery needs including the replacement of essential items such as equipment or livestock, reorganization of a farming operation or the refinance of certain debts.

Producers in the contiguous Kansas counties of Cheyenne, Decatur, Sherman, and Thomas, along with Dundy, Hitchcock, and Red Willow counties in Nebraska, are also eligible to apply for emergency loans.

The deadline to apply for these emergency loans is Oct. 5, 2020.

FSA will review the loans based on the extent of losses, security available and repayment ability.

Secretary previously announced several Kansas counties as primary natural disaster areas. A listing of all disaster designations can be found at fsa.usda.gov.

FSA has a variety of additional programs to help farmers recover from the impacts of this disaster. FSA programs that do not require a disaster declaration include: Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honeybees and Farm-Raised Fish Program; Emergency Conservation Program; Livestock Forage Disaster Program; Livestock Indemnity Program; Operating and Farm Ownership Loans; and the Tree Assistance Program.

Farmers may contact their local USDA service center for further information on eligibility requirements and application procedures for these and other programs. Additional information is also available online at farmers.gov/recover. ❖",None,2589
Kansas,Sedgwick,,https://www.kansas.com/news/politics-government/article241433771.html,"Sedgwick County, KS recommends stay-at-home order","Sedgwick County has become the latest in Kansas to order an array of businesses to shut down and most workers to stay home in the ongoing battle against the coronavirus and COVID-19, pending a decision from the county’s local health officer.

In a special meeting late Monday afternoon, the County Commission, acting as the Board of Health, recommended a widespread closure of business in and around Wichita for a period of 30 days starting March 25. To take effect, the local health officer Garold Minns would need to sign off on the order.

Commissioner Lacey Cruse said the order is necessary, in part, because the county doesn’t have a good handle on how the disease is spreading locally because testing is severely limited.

“We won’t have an economy if we don’t have people. And I think that it’s important to understand that people are our most valuable resources,” Cruse said.

The ordinance is nearly identical to the stay-at-home orders issued earlier in Kansas City suburbs and exurbs including Johnson, Wyandotte, Douglas and Leavenworth counties. On Monday, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly announced an executive order banning gatherings of more than 10 people across the state.

So far, the coronavirus has been more prevalent in those areas than in south-central Kansas. But officials acknowledge that due to supply shortages, they’ve been unable to test sufficiently to establish the extent of COVID-19 in the Wichita area.

The disease has now entered a phase of community spread, meaning that residents appear to be catching it from each other, in contrast to the earliest local cases that were caused by exposure on a cruise ship vacation or imported directly from other states where the disease has been more widespread.

As of 2:30 p.m. Monday, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported 82 cases of COVID-19 including two deaths.

The cases are spread across 16 of the state’s 105 counties, led by Johnson County, 32 cases, and Wyandotte County, 16 cases. Sedgwick County had three positive tests as of Monday, according to County Manager Tom Stolz.

Local hospital leaders told county commissioners on Monday that there could be as many as 1,000 cases in the Wichita area, Commission Chair Pete Meitzner said.

“They believe that the virus is alive in our community,” Meitzner said of Wesley Healthcare and Ascension Via Christi, Wichita’s largest hospital systems.

Local law enforcement will be empowered to enforce the order, but no penalty — civil or criminal — has been set.

Some enforcement decisions will rest with local authorities, depending on their city municipal codes, Stolz said.

He said he’s been in contact with Sheriff Jeff Easter and Wichita Police Chief Gordon Ramsay and they both indicated they don’t have the personnel resources or desire to run harsh crackdowns enforcing the order.

Stolz assured the commission that the sheriff’s deputies will not be actively pulling people over to check whether they’re supposed to be out and about.

The commission acted after the Sedgwick County Medical Society, representing 1,250 physicians, sent a letter calling for a “shelter-in-place order that would be reassessed in two weeks.”

“Though Sedgwick County is fortunate to have only a few confirmed cases of COVID-19 thus far, that is unlikely to last long,” said the letter, signed by society board president Patricia Wyatt-Harris. “Because a surge of new cases could quickly overwhelm our hospital systems and put citizens’ lives at risk, it is critical to take action now to decrease local spread.”

The Sedgwick County ordinance includes a list of exemptions for critical governmental functions, services and industries.

Health care and public safety top the list of exemptions, with carve-outs for health workers, police, firefighters, paramedics and other emergency responders.

People will still be allowed to walk their dogs and take part in other outdoors activities as long as they observe social distancing, which means keeping a 6-foot buffer between people. Parks will remain open, but school playgrounds will not. Fishing and other food-gathering activities are also allowed.

Restaurants will be allowed to provide products on a pick-up or delivery basis only, to discourage crowds from gathering for nonessential activity. Most entertainment venues and other leisure activities are already shut down.

People will also be allowed to go to the grocery store or deliver provisions to family or friends. Child care facilities would be open but limited to ten people at a time in a confined space. Commissioner Michael O’Donnell said the county will need to get further guidance from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment on the rules for child care.

Businesses in the food-supply chain, including grocery stores, dollar stores, gas stations and mini-marts will be allowed to remain open, along with auto shops, businesses that sell pet supplies and other businesses deemed necessary for the safe functioning of society.

Plumbers, electricians, painters and construction workers are exempt, as are many professionals such as lawyers and accountants. Many area professionals have already taken steps for them and their employees to work remotely from home as much as possible.

Aerospace and other manufacturing plants will continue to operate those assembly lines, with workers directed to keep as much separation between themselves and co-workers as possible.

The county also wrote in an exemption for church-based relief efforts providing food and other supplies to homebound residents. The one added exemption to the ordinance passed in the Kansas City area was adding leaders and employees of religious institutions to the list of people allowed to go to work.

Commissioners took action a day after the county health officer, University of Kansas physician Garold Minns, urged a relatively cautious approach because of the economic damage that could come with a lengthy and widespread closure.

But Minns, dean of the KU Medical School in Wichita, also cautioned that if a stay-at-home order were to become necessary, it should be comprehensive and not contain so many exemptions that the majority of people could go about their routine business.

“We know it’s going to get worse. We know that. We just don’t know how long it is going to take,” Commissioner Jim Howell said. He said it’s important to continue monitoring the situation daily to make sure the hospitals don’t get overwhelmed. He said these kinds of measures will likely last three months.

The recommendation passed 3-2, with Howell and O’Donnell voting against it. Howell said he needed more data, and O’Donnell said he wanted Minns to make the decision on his own.

Commissioner David Dennis echoed concerns about a lack of testing in Sedgwick County.

“Without testing, we don’t know the extent of the problem here in Sedgwick County and that’s a big problem,” Dennis said.

Elisha Yaghmai, a Wichita physician and president of FreeState Healthcare, said a shortage of testing materials across the country severely limits what strategies communities can deploy to fight coronavirus.

With more test kits, Sedgwick County could take a more targeted approach, Yaghmai said. But the tests aren’t available and it’s unclear when and if those will ever become available.

“Until we can come up with a better approach from a testing and epidemiology perspective, and since we don’t know when that’s coming, in the short term we may very well need to move to just the stay-at-home scenario to try to protect who we can protect,” Yaghmai said.",shelter_in_place,505415

The local disaster emergency was activated because of an imminent threat from contagious disease. The declaration gives the county government the flexibility to manage operations in a rapidly changing environment and will make federal and state assistance available. The county's Local Emergency Operations Plan has also been activated, allowing for collaboration between public safety organizations, local health officials and other community stakeholders.

The prohibition of 50 people or less is in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and general best practices.

""This declaration will allow us to respond to the coronavirus pandemic and request additional resources,"" said Commission Chairman Pete Meitzner. ""We will continue to assess the prohibition on an ongoing basis.""

There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Sedgwick County. Similar to other coronaviruses, COVID-19 is likely spread by droplets from an infected person's nose or mouth through coughing and sneezing.

Below is a list of way you can help prevent illness:

• Wash your hands often with soap and water, use hand sanitizer if soap isn't available.

• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

• Cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.

• Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth

• Clean and disinfect your surfaces and objects that may be contaminated with germs

NKyTribune staff

Boone, Kenton, Campbell and Grant counties declared states of emergency Friday, to further prepare and respond to COVID-19.

The four judges/executive declared the States of Emergency in order to activate the individual County Emergency Operations Plans and to encourage cooperation between all levels of government and public health officials to ensure a proactive and coordinated response to the coronavirus.

There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Northern Kentucky at this time, but this action enables the Emergency Management Team to have additional resources at their disposal.

“Boone County has been closely monitoring the current situation and now is the appropriate time to act. We will continue to coordinate our efforts and assist in the multidisciplinary and regional response to the coronavirus,” Judge/Executive Gary Moore said. “Boone County residents should remain calm and be confident that County government will be doing everything within its power to keep the community safe and prepared. I urge everyone to continue to take appropriate steps to protect their own health in accordance with Northern Kentucky Health Department and CDC guidelines. The entire County organization and the Health Department have my full support and confidence.”

The four counties comprise the Northern Kentucky Health Department, which provides public health services to their more than 400,000 residents.

“We are in full support of the decision of our elected officials to declare states of emergency. Declaring states of emergency opens our area to additional resources to support efforts to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 in our region,” stated NKY Health’s District Director of Health, Lynne Saddler, MD, MPH.

NKY Health continues to work with partners to prepare and plan for the spread of COVID-19 in the community. This includes education and guidance to the general public and health care providers, as well as other sectors, including schools, first responders, social service agencies, homeless shelters and organizations that serve those at high risk of becoming very sick from COVID-19.

Kenton County Judge/Executive Kris Knochelmann called on the communities of Northern Kentucky to come together as the region’s health and government leaders have.

“Kenton County has been working with our local partners in response to COVID-19 in order to best protect our community” said Judge/Execurtive Knochelmann. “Residents are encouraged to check the County’s website regularly for local and state updates from the Health Department and the office of the Governor. Please keep your family and neighbors in mind going forward, and we will emerge stronger as a community on the other side of this event.”

The proclamations allow emergency services to activate internal processes for local and inter-jurisdictional disaster emergency planning and purchasing.

This does not mean that schools, business, churches and other like organizations have to close. It is at the discretion of each entity to make the decision whether or not to remain in operation.

Community members are encouraged to follow the Northern Kentucky Health Department (NKYHD) guidelines to protect against COVID-19 including:

*Wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

*Stay home when you feel sick.

*Get the flu vaccine.

*Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose with unwashed hands.

*Properly cover your sneeze and cough with a tissue, then throw away the used tissue.

*Frequently disinfect objects and surfaces with a cleaner that you typically use.

*Avoid close contact with those who are sick.

Those feeling ill are advised to contact their local physician first before going to the emergency room.

Despite the lack of any identified cases of COVID-19 in Northern Kentucky, the situation continues to evolve.

“While there will likely be cases of COVID-19 in Campbell County, the declaration does not mean we think our community is less safe than anywhere else impacted by the virus,” said William R. Turner the Director of the County’s Office of Emergency Management. “This is just one more tool to aid in our response.”

State of Emergency Declarations are a typical response to COVID-19, and municipalities across the country are using them to ensure appropriate resources are available for response and recovery.

In consultation with local health department officials, the counties’ leaders are confident the people of Northern Kentucky remain at low risk and citizens are encouraged to visit the Northern Kentucky Health Department website for more information.

Kentucky,Grayson,,https://gcnewsgazette.com/Content/Default/Local-News-Stories/Article/State-of-emergency-declared-in-Grayson/-3/9/2181,State of emergency declared in Grayson,"Following a press conference involving multiple local officials on Tuesday morning, Grayson County Judge Executive Kevin Henderson signed an order declaring a state of emergency in Grayson County in response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

At press time Friday, at least one person had been tested in Grayson County for COVID-19, but there have been no positive cases of the virus locally.

The first to speak during Tuesday's press conference, following Henderson's introductions, was Twin Lakes Regional Medical Center CEO Wayne Meriwether, who said hospital staff have referred to this period as the ""calm before the storm.""

While information is changing by the hour, Meriwether said TLRMC is prepared.

""We have our plan in place to address COVID-19,"" he said.

TLRMC this week implemented strict visitor restrictions, as well as the cancellation of all locally performed elective procedures (those that are planned and will not endanger a patient's life should they be cancelled).

While Grayson County has not yet had a patient diagnosed with COVID-19, hospital officials expect that it will before the pandemic has subsided, Meriwether said.

An individual who is diagnosed with COVID-19 is recommended to be off from work for 14 days, officials say.

Currently, the hospital's patient capacity is manageable, despite receiving about 60 percent of its supplies due to limited availability, but local health care officials say precautions put in place by the federal, state, and local governments are warranted to stave off the spread of COVID-19.

Dr. Joe Lee, of Leitchfield Pediatrics, said social distancing, including the closure of schools and businesses such as restaurants (with the exception of carry-out or drive-thru), is a vital, if inconvenient, part of this endeavor.

""In addition to social distancing, you want to make sure you're washing your hands more than you've ever done it,"" Lee said, adding that people should also cover their cough - not with their hands, but with their elbow or a tissue.

It is also important to frequently wipe off surfaces hands may touch, according to Lee.

The issue at hand, Lee said, is that officials do not know how many people have COVID-19 and may not be aware of it or show symptoms, but by implementing social distancing early, it can prevent the virus from spreading before it infects a greater number of people than providers may be equipped to deal with.

Lee was followed by Grayson County Public Health Director Josh Embry who asked the community to be patient with health care providers while they work to secure testing materials.

Embry echoed Lee's sentiments by saying that, while he understands social distancing is an inconvenience, it not only protects citizens from potential exposure to the coronavirus, it also allows health care officials more time to prepare to respond to it.

Grayson County Schools Superintendent Doug Robinson then addressed the recent school closure, which is, tentatively, in effect until April 13, but could potentially last longer.

On Monday, Grayson County Schools served 441 lunches to students through its Meals on the Bus program, and that number is expected to increase daily, with new stops being added as the weeks go on.

""Some mobile food routes will be flexible depending on need,"" Robinson said.

Anyone with questions is encouraged to call the Grayson County Board of Education or their child's school at one of the numbers listed below.

Henderson then addressed the community directly, encouraging residents to help one another and make use of the resources available to them if they require assistance.

""We're all in this together,"" Henderson said, adding that officials want to be ""proactive and not reactive"" to the situation.

He asked that residents follow the guidelines set by the state and federal governments and to reach out to their friends and neighbors and help them if needed.

""If we all come together and try to make the best decisions, we'll be okay,"" Henderson said.

He also asked residents to be patient with retailers and their employees, ensuring that they will not stop delivering items, and to be mindful of one another and not hoard items.

Henderson encouraged residents to remember local businesses during this time of economic strife and continue to support them by shopping locally.

And finally, he said residents should not panic.

As such, there’s a dearth of college football news as spring practices have all but been canceled at every level of the sport. And there’s even some concern that the health issue could have an impact on the 2020 college football campaign.

In that vein, we thought it might be fun to go back through the CollegeFootballTalk archives and take a peek at what transpired in the sport on this date.

SALYERSVILLE – With eight confirmed cases in the state, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had its first effect on Magoffin County, with the governor issuing an order restricting visitation to nursing homes and long-term care facilities.

Salyersville Nursing and Rehabilitation Center Administrator Josh Calhoun released the following statement on Tuesday, March 10, after Governor Andy Beshear’s order was made public:

“We are aware of the situation surrounding the COVID-19 virus and following it very closely. Our facility is using the CDC guidelines as direction, and suggest the community do the same. We ask that visitors with any signs or symptoms, been exposed to, recently recovered or have traveled to areas with any type of viral/bacterial outbreak to refrain from visiting our residents. Visitors will be limited based on the orders set forth by the governor of Kentucky. As with any type of illness, we cannot express enough the importance of proper hand washing and cough etiquette.”

In a video posted on Facebook, Calhoun went into more detail, stating, “I want to ensure all family members that your loved ones are safe within our care. I’d also like to say as an extra precaution each day our staff will have their temperature taken and a health screen will be performed to keep your family members safe and make sure we don’t let anyone in our facility that may be sick.”

Calhoun reiterated the patients’ needs are their highest concern, noting that family members can still bring items to residents.

“If there are things you would like to have delivered to your family members, please do so at the Blue Wing awning and we’ll gladly accept those at the door,” Calhoun said. “We can ask that you not enter the facility for the safety of our residents and to the order given to us by the governor of Kentucky.”

Calhoun said if anyone has any questions to call his office at 606-349-6181, Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The order issued by the governor, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services and Office of Inspector General stated, “In addition to the recent recommendations from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, Department for Public Health, pursuant to authority granted in KRS 214.020 and Executive Order 2020-215 hereby issues this supplemental guidance by recommending that long-term care facilities limit visitation only to those loved ones that are receiving end-of-life care.”

The order further explains that the visitors that are allowed will have to have their temperatures taken at the facility’s front desk and they must be escorted to and from the room they are visiting. Visitors with 100.1 degrees F temperatures will be denied entry and should be advised to seek medical attention if they are showing any other respiratory infection signs or symptoms,

if they have recently traveled internationally to restricted countries or if they have had contact with someone under investigation for COVID-19.

On Tuesday evening, Governor Beshear held a press conference on the issue, stating that 20 cases had been tested on Tuesday, with 18 negative and 2 positive. At press time, the total number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Kentucky remains at eight, though Beshear noted that number will rise. Of the eight, five are in Harrison County, two in Fayette and one in Jefferson.

He said all of the Harrison County individuals can be linked.

Beshear commended Harrison County for their quick actions, canceling schools and distributing small newspapers to all residents with important information about the virus.

“This just shows being prepared and taking the necessary steps can do so much,” Beshear said.

He noted that the state of emergency is still in effect, allowing the state access to all the tools and supplies needed to combat the virus.

Beshear also emphasized that if someone is sick and suspects it could be COVID-19, they should call the Coronavirus Hotline at 1-800-722-5725. He urged sick people to stay home unless they require medical attention.

People over 60 years old and people with heart, lung or kidney diseases or other chronic illnesses are urged to avoid large crowds, to not fly and to not get on cruise ships, per the Center for Disease Control’s guidelines.

As for the restrictions on the nursing home and long-term care facilities’ visitation, Beshear said, “This is about life, health and safety. It’s my job to help prevent what happened in Seattle from happening here.”

He urged businesses to prepare telework options and paid sick leave that would cover employees from the time of concern, the testing period and the recovery period.

On Monday, Magoffin County Health Department Director and Salyersville Mayor James “Pete

Shepherd handed out flyers to local businesses, detailing facts from the CDC regarding COVID-19, including:

- diseases can make anyone sick regardless of race or ethnicity,

- people who have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or been in an area with an ongoing spread are at an increased risk of exposure,

- someone who has completed quarantine or has been released from isolation does not pose a risk of infection to other people,

- know the symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath) and seek medical advice if you develop symptoms and have been in contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or to an area with an ongoing spread of COVID-19,

- wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands; stay home when you’re sick; and cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.

Maryland,Anne Arundel,43902.95556,https://patch.com/maryland/annapolis/coronavirus-spurs-state-emergency-anne-arundel-county,Coronavirus Spurs State Of Emergency For Anne Arundel County,"ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, MD — A state of emergency will be declared for Anne Arundel County Friday. County Executive Steuart Pittman made the announcement Thursday after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan's press conference that outlines the steps needed to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus. The Anne Arundel County government will remain open to provide services to county residents and businesses during what's being called a ""public health crisis.""

""The extraordinary measures that Gov. Hogan announced today may come as a shock to some county residents but I fully support his decisions,"" said Pittman in a statement. ""Unless we act broadly and decisively to slow the spread of this virus, the capacity of our hospitals to treat critically ill patients could be exceeded, as it has been elsewhere in the world. Local government services are essential, not only to our public health response, but also to help residents during this period. Therefore, we are keeping county government open. I want to thank all public servants and all county residents in advance for their service and their sacrifice. We will get through this together.""



Anne Arundel County Health Officer Dr. Nilesh Kayanaraman and office of emergency management personnel remain in regular contact with the Maryland Department of Health, county agencies, City of Annapolis government, hospitals and health care providers.

Pittman also directed the office of personnel to create a new telework policy to allow flexibility for most county workers to perform their duties remotely during this crisis. The new guidance is expected to be implemented March 16 to align with the two-week closure of all state schools announced Thursday by State Superintendent Karen Salmon.



The Anne Arundel Department of Health also issued new guidance on public events designed to protect residents and prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The guidance is intended for private and local organizations and community partners in Anne Arundel County and the City of Annapolis.



""Each of us is responsible to take actions that will slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease,"" said Kalyanaraman. ""These limits on public gatherings are critical to protect the vulnerable and give our healthcare system the time to care for the rapidly growing numbers of those who are getting sick with this disease.""



The department recommends the following for gatherings scheduled through the end of April:

Postpone or cancel all public gathering of more than 250 people per the governor's order on March 12

Postpone or cancel public gatherings that meet anyof the following criteria:

Are targeted toward or comprised of significant numbers of high-risk individuals (elderly who are 60+, chronic illness, homeless)



Cannot provide at least six feet of space between attendees



Offer alternative methods of meeting the gathering's goals (e.g. live streaming)

Baltimore-area leaders are sending a message that they are prepared to address concerns connected to the coronavirus pandemic.|| Late-breaking coronavirus updates | Maryland's latest numbers ||Baltimore Mayor Jack Young, joined by major department heads Monday afternoon, addressed questions, concerns and rumors making the rounds.The mayor said he supports Gov. Larry Hogan's order issued Monday to close nonessential businesses.""This order helps protect our most vulnerable residents by limiting opportunities for the disease to spread,"" Young said.The governor's announcement did not include a shelter-in-place requirement, but city officials are urging residents to remain home as much as possible to help limit contact and slow the transmission of the coronavirus.In the city, a police Social Distancing Task Force is responsible for enforcing governor's directive, and officers will check to make sure businesses are closed and will keep an eye on them.""Just like with the first executive order, we are now making adjustments to make sure we can enforce the governor's executive orders with the additional closures beginning at 5 p.m. (Monday), and when we get calls of noncompliance where there are gatherings of 10 people or more, we are responding to that and dispersing those individuals and educating those business owners as to what's required with the governor's executive orders. We've had a few calls to disperse gatherings of 10 or more, and we will continue to do that, and we will continue patrols and answering calls to make sure that our Social Distancing Task force will go out and make sure that businesses are in compliance, and when we find that they are not, we will take appropriate action,"" Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said.""Our approach is to make sure that people recognize the fact that this is a serious matter and that this is the order of the governor. To this point, we've had full compliance, we haven't had any issues, and we've been successful, but at the end of the day, we will make sure that when we have gatherings that get brought to our attention, they will be resolved,"" Baltimore County Police Chief Melissa Hyatt said.The order will not impact essential city services -- police, fire and emergency responders will continue to respond to 911 calls; trash and recycling will still be picked up; and Citizen Drop-Off Centers will remain open, among other services. Additionally, the Emergency Operations Center will remain active to manage the city's response to the virus.Speaking Monday afternoon, Harrison also clarified the purpose of the National Guard in Baltimore.""I want to take this time to play down any rumors that might be out there: The National Guard is here to support meal distribution, provide aid and planning and transportation and logistical assistance as needed, but the Baltimore Police Department is committed to working around the clock to keep the members of the public and the department informed of where the agency stands with COVID-19 preparations and actions,"" Harrison said.As of Monday morning, Baltimore City has 31 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Maryland Department of Health.There is evidence of community transmission of the coronavirus in Baltimore.Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Letitia Dzirasa said the city's response is focused on community mitigation and preparation for potential hospital surge, adding that not everyone requires testing or evaluation by a physician for the onset of mild symptoms.""The Maryland Department of Health updated some of its policies in order to ensure that those at high risk for COVID-19 will be prioritized for testing,” Dzirasa said.“We really only want people to call 911 when there is a life-threatening emergency we don't want to over exacerbate the system,” said BCFD Fire Chief Niles Ford.The Baltimore City fire chief said nine city fire personnel in two incidents were taken off-duty temporarily after handling two suspected coronavirus patients. Those patients turned out to be negative for coronavirus, and the personnel returned to duty.Several city agencies have adjusted service hours and operations.Parking Authority of Baltimore -- The Parking Authority of Baltimore remains closed. However, staff are available to assist the public via email at parkingauthority@bcparking.com or by phone at 443-573-2800. No employees will be working from the office until the emergency has been lifted.Parking meters/parking meter restrictions will not be in effect for this period.No payment is required at parking meters.Baltimore Municipal and Zoning Appeals (BMZA) -- As of Monday, BMZA has suspended all operations. No new appeals will be accepted and all hearings in April are hereby suspended until further notice. New appeals and rescheduled hearings will be scheduled and heard on an expedited basis when operations resume.Mayor's Office of Employment Development -- MOED has suspended the operation of its adult and youth service locations due to COVID-19. This impacts a number of the services. Those seeking help with finding employment or other supports are encouraged to visit the MOED's website for links to resources that are available at this time.Department of Transportation -- The Department of Transportation (DOT) will scale back its employee workforce in order to comply with social distancing protocols. On-call crews will be used to perform daily agency operations, which will be significantly reduced. As a result, the following services will be affected:The enforcement of Residential Permit Parking, street cleaning parking, 48-hour parking, abandoned vehicles and peak hour parking violations will be suspended. Transportation Enforcement Officers will focus on citing immediate safety and pedestrian issues.Vehicle towing operations will be significantly reduced and will focus on immediate safety issues. The city's impound facilities at Pulaski Highway and Fallsway remain closed to the public.DOT Maintenance crews and operations will be scaled back to focus on emergency and critical issues related to the repair of roadways, signs, lighting, etc.Traffic calming studies will be postponed.Federal contract work will continue to operate throughout the city of Baltimore. This includes bridge, buildings and reconstruction/streetscape projects.Paving and sidewalk work (except for federally funded projects) will be postponed.Conduit contractors will reduce their work forces and respond only to critical BGE-related repairs.DOT's Right-of-Way office remains closed to the public and permit requests should be submitted online.Parking meter payments/restrictions will not be enforced for this period.Coronavirus - What you should knowThe following information is from the CDC:What are the signs and symptoms?The following symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure.FeverCoughShortness of breathReported illnesses have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death for confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases.How does COVID-19 Spread?Person-to-person spreadThe virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.Can someone spread the virus without being sick?People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest).Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with this new coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.Spread from contact with infected surfaces or objectsIt may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.How easily does coronavirus spread?The virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected geographic areas.How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious (spread easily), like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily.Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, spreading continually without stopping.Prevention and treatmentThere is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:Avoid close contact with people who are sick.Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.Stay home when you are sick.Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.Follow CDC’s recommendations for using a facemask.CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19.Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.For information about handwashing, see CDC’s Handwashing website.For information specific to healthcare, see CDC’s Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings.These are everyday habits that can help prevent the spread of several viruses. CDC does have specific guidance for travelers.",None,823015

NORTH ADAMS, Mass. — Gov. Charlie Baker declared a state of emergency on Tuesday afternoon as the state continued to grapple with rising numbers of presumptive positives for the novel coronavirus.

The governor, at a press conference broadcast from Boston, said the Executive Branch would begin instituting measures to address the spread of the disease, including prohibiting international travel on behalf of the state for its 42,000 employees, encouraging the use of telecommunicating and video conferencing where viable, canceling large events and asking workers who are sick or who exposed to the virus to remain home.

The total number of presumptive positives for COVID-19 in the state rose to 92 — double the number on Monday — with seven of those in Berkshire County.

One of the two new cases reported in Berkshire County is an employee of General Dynamics.

The defense company in Pittsfield learned on Monday afternoon that one of its employee had been quarantined and was being treated at a medical facility. Staff who had been in contact with the employee have been asked to ""self-quarantine"" for two weeks.

Also, North Adams City Councilor Jason LaForest, who is also a nurse, has entered quarantine after being tested for exposure to the novel coronavirus. According to a statement from Mayor Thomas Bernard, LaForest developed ""mild symptoms"" on Tuesday morning and that the mayor has also elected to work from home after attending ""weekend social functions with Councilor LaForest.""

The first patient in Berkshire County was identified on Saturday after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control lifted some of the restrictions on testing. The first presumptive positive case in the state was a woman in Norfolk County on March 2.

""MEMA has been activated and is bringing together health, human service, public safety and several other government agencies,"" said the governor. ""This working group is following the Department of Public Health infectious disease task force that was stood up in January. ... this declaration will give our administration more flexibility to respond to this outbreak.""

He said the risks for transmission have increased, noting the Berkshire cases ""that just popped.""

Sudders said the presumptive positive is based on testing from the state Public Health Lab. ""Those specimens will now be sent to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control & Prevention for confirmation,"" she said.

Of the 92 reported cases, 70 are related to a Biogen conference held in Boston at the end of February and four are travel related. Secretary of Health and Human Services Marylou Sudders said 18 are under investigation. Six people are hospitalized, 62 are not and 24 are under investigation; 40 are women and 52 are men.

Another man from nearby Readsboro, Vt., was hospitalized on Thursday at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington.

COVID-19 first spread in the vicinity of Wuhan, China, where it has so far killed more than 3,000 deaths out of more than 80,000 cases. There are now more than 800 cases identified in the United States and 28 deaths — most of those in the state of Washington.

The symptoms include fever, severe cough and respiratory distress. At least 80 percent of those contracting the disease will recover with the severity of the illness ranging from hospitalization to minor or no symptoms. Those most at risk are individuals age 60 and older or who have underlying medical conditions.

Officials said the coronavirus is apparently spreading through person-to-person contact now, beyond any direct correlations to travel or the conference.

Because the outbreak is ""rapidly expanding"" through community transmission, said Commissioner of Public Health Dr. Monica Bharel, ""we are at a critical point in this outbreak ... we will need everybody's cooperation.""

The governor applauded the decision by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh on Tuesday to cancel the St. Patrick's Day Parade but said it's too early yet to consider the Boston Marathon that is a month away. He said private enterprises should consider how they will address situations such as sporting events, conferences and large gatherings.

Local organizations are making decisions on how to prevent the spread of the disease. The town of Clarksburg shut down its public buildings on Sunday to allow them to be cleaned and sanitized after it was learned the first Berkshire County came from that town.

General Dynamics has instituted measures including cleaning and disinfecting work areas and common spaces used by the affected employees, ""who was in the facility for several days out of the last two weeks,"" according to a statement from the company.

""The Pittsfield facility remains open for business. We are working closely with officials from Berkshire County to keep them apprised of our proactive measures. The health and safety of our employees, our Navy partners, and our community is our top priority,"" said Carlo Zaffanella, vice president and general manager of Maritime and Strategic Systems for General Dynamics Mission Systems.

The Berkshire Food Project, which feeds dozens of people lunch every week day in North Adams, posted on Facebook that it would be ""sanitizing tables a lot"" and rearranging them to reduce the number of people sitting together in close proximity.

""We are trying to be overly cautious because we care about everyone who dines with us,"" the post states, adding that ""we will be happy to provide your meal to go if you are concerned about congregating in our dining room for a meal.""

The North Adams Public Schools and McCann Technical School were disinfected by fogging devices over the weekend. Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art ""is actively following CDC recommendations,"" according to its website , which includes ""cleaning of touch surfaces, deployment of more hand-disinfectant stations, and encouragement of frequent hand washing, and hygienic 'sneeze and cough' etiquette.""

The vast museum may be large enough to allow browsing while still keeping the recommended social distancing of 6 feet to prevent transmission.

Michigan,Bay,43907.94653,https://www.mlive.com/coronavirus/2020/03/bay-county-declared-in-state-of-emergency-due-to-coronavirus.html,Bay County declared in state of emergency due to coronavirus,"BAY CITY, MI — Bay County is officially in a state of emergency amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Bay County Executive Jim Barcia on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 17, announced the declaration of a local state of emergency for the county. He made the declaration during the Bay County Board of Commissioners meeting held within the gymnasium of the Bay County Community Center at 800 John F. Kennedy Drive in Bay City.

The declaration comes a few days after the county’s first presumptive positive test for a case of coronavirus, that man being a Bay County resident and physician at Covenant HealthCare in Saginaw.

Such a declaration lasts seven days, but the board voted to extend it until its next meeting on April 14.

“We know there are more,” Barcia said. “Additional people have been tested. We don’t know what the results of those tests are. This will make Bay County eligible for all the resources made available to our municipal government from federal and state governments in Lansing and Washington. All this does is declare what we have — a state of emergency.”

Barcia said it typically takes eight days for results to come in on the coronavirus tests.

“We are concerned for everyone’s health and safety during this coronavirus disease pandemic,” Barcia continued. “Much has changed in just a short period of time. We are going to be taking all necessary steps to help stop the spread of this disease in our community while continuing to provide the services that are needed.”

He added that as of Tuesday morning, offices within the Bay County Building are closed to the public.

“However, services will still be provided to the public as our workers will still be reporting,” Barcia said.

Bay County Health Department Director Joel R. Strasz said his agency’s staff have been working with peers in Saginaw and Midland counties as well as with personnel at Covenant HealthCare.

“We have contacted nearly two dozen individuals associated with this case,” said Strasz, referring to the presumptive positive Bay County case. “In some cases, some individuals have self-quarantined for the 14-day process.”

He added about 30 people have been tested, those tests having been submitted to state and private labs.

“At least seven have come back negative and we’re waiting to hear on the remaining tests,” Strasz said. An estimated 15 people have been admitted to inpatient hospitals with symptoms similar to those of coronavirus, he continued.

The state can process about 150 tests per day and that is being ramped up, Strasz said.

Both Barcia and Strasz said that as Bay County has the highest percentage of residents 60 or older, it is imperative for all citizens to do their part in flattening the curve, or stymieing the contagion’s spread.

“We must protect all Bay County residents, but especially the most vulnerable,” Strasz said.

As of Tuesday, there are 65 people in Michigan who have tested presumptive positive for coronavirus, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.

PREVENTION TIPS

Michigan’s State Emergency Operations Center is coordinating state-government resources and the response to the coronavirus spread. It has shared the following tips:

What you can do to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases:

· Always cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue or sleeve.

· Stay home if you are sick and advise others to do the same.

· Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

· Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

· Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

· Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and warm water are not available.

· Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (computers, keyboards, desks, etc.).

· It’s not too late to get your flu shot! While the influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19 infection, it can help keep you healthy during the flu season.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A series of missteps at the nation’s top public health agency caused a critical shortage of reliable laboratory tests for the coronavirus, hobbling the federal response as the pandemic spread across the country like wildfire, an Associated Press review found.

President Donald Trump assured Americans early this month that the COVID-19 test developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is “perfect” and that “anyone who wants a test can get a test.” But more than two months after the first U.S. case of the new disease was confirmed, many people still cannot get tested.

In the critical month of February, as the virus began taking root in the U.S. population, CDC data shows government labs processed 352 COVID-19 tests — an average of only a dozen per day.

“You cannot fight a fire blindfolded,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, said at a recent briefing. “We cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected.”

The Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the CDC, has begun an internal review to assess its own mistakes. But outside observers and federal health officials have pointed to four primary issues that together hampered the national response — the early decision not to use the test adopted by the World Health Organization, flaws with the more complex test developed by the CDC, government guidelines restricting who could be tested and delays in engaging the private sector to ramp up testing capacity.

Combined with messaging from the White House minimizing the disease, that fueled a lackluster response that missed chances to slow the spread of the virus, they said.

“There were many, many opportunities not to end up where we are,” Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard, told the AP. “Basically, they took this as business as usual. ... And that’s because the messaging from the White House was ‘this is not a big deal, this is no worse than the flu.’ So that message basically created no sense of urgency within the FDA or the CDC to fix it.”

Even as private labs have been cleared by government regulators to process tens of thousands of additional tests in the last two weeks, experts warn that the nation is still falling well short of enough testing capacity to keep ahead of the highly contagious virus. And it can often take a week just to get results back.

Trump last week rated his administration’s response to the crisis as a perfect 10. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the CDC’s system wasn’t designed to test for and track a widespread outbreak, which he characterized as “a failing.”

In interviews with the AP, two federal health officials with direct knowledge of the situation said CDC experts don’t know why many of the agency’s test kits failed to reliably detect the virus. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about what went wrong.

J. Stephen Morrison, a health policy expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, called the testing issues a “debacle,” contributing to what he described as a confused and delayed federal response to the crisis.

As a result, he said, the CDC has now been marginalized within the White House — a worrisome development.

“CDC has generally been regarded as the best in the game,” Morrison said. “I don’t think they anticipated the technical difficulty or the speed with which the virus has been moving. The virus was racing out ahead of them.”

FATEFUL DECISIONS

On New Year’s Eve, Chinese scientists informed the World Health Organization about a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases of unknown cause in the industrial megalopolis of Wuhan that they linked to the city’s wholesale fish market. Less than two weeks later, the Chinese had sequenced the virus’ genetic makeup and shared it with the world.

Within days, German scientists had developed a test that could identify a unique part of the virus’ DNA. The WHO quickly adopted the German test, publishing technical guidelines on Jan. 17 and working with private companies to produce testing kits.

As they have done with some past outbreaks, officials at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta decided to develop their own test, focusing on three gene targets distinct from what the WHO used. Over the decades, the headquarters lab had built a track record of being among the first to develop tests for new diseases and quickly making them available for disease tracking.

The CDC published the technical details for its COVID-19 test on Jan. 28, 10 days after the WHO. By then, the virus had already been in the U.S. for at least two weeks.

The 35-year-old man who would become the first American to test positive had arrived in Seattle on Jan. 15, following a trip to Wuhan. After swabs from his nose and throat were flown to the CDC lab, federal officials announced the results Jan. 21.

In an interview on CNBC the following day, the Republican president was asked about the risk to the nation.

“We have it totally under control,” he said. “It’s one person coming in from China. ... It’s going to be just fine.”

With limited capacity at the CDC lab in Atlanta, the agency placed strict criteria on who could be tested: people with fevers, coughing or difficulty breathing who had also visited Wuhan within the preceding two weeks or who had close contact with someone already confirmed or under investigation for having the virus.

On Jan. 30, the day the WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency, Trump again assured the American people that the virus was “very well under control.”

Then he departed for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, where he tweeted a photo of himself playing golf at his club in West Palm Beach.

“Getting a little exercise this morning!” the president wrote.

The following day, the U.S. declared its own emergency. Still, U.S. citizens returning from China who did not have a fever weren’t tested for the virus but were encouraged to self-quarantine at home for 14 days.

At that point, the CDC had confirmed just eight cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. The agency amended its testing criteria to include people with fevers who had traveled to China, rather than just Wuhan.

___

FLAWED TEST KITS

Four days after the U.S. declared a state of emergency, only 178 patients had been tested and 82 others were listed as “pending,” meaning they were awaiting final results, according to CDC data released at the time.

To help increase the number of people being screened, the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency authorization for CDC-certified labs run by state health departments to begin processing swabs, and they were provided with kits that could test 250 patients.

As the first tests were processed at the state labs, technicians reported getting inconclusive results, which the CDC has said could be due to the test looking for signs of generic coronaviruses, of which there are many, rather than the specific virus that causes COVID-19.

Whatever the reason, by mid-February, only about a half-dozen state and local public health labs had reliable tests. But still, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield continued to insist his agency had developed “a very accurate test.”

“We found that, in some of the states, it didn’t work,” Redfield said earlier this month. “We figured out why. I don’t consider that a fault. I consider that doing quality control. I consider that success.”

The testing problems emerged just as the CDC broadened its criteria to include patients who were “severely ill” with COVID-19 symptoms “even if a known source of exposure has not been identified.”

As more sick people sought to be tested, many states were forced to limit access because of the flawed CDC test. Accounts began to emerge through social media of people with all the symptoms of COVID-19 who either couldn’t get tested or had test results delayed by days or even a week.

“I know of doctor friends of mine who have critically ill patients in the ICU, and we don’t know if they have COVID or not because we can’t get a test,” Jha said last week.

___

COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION

On Feb. 24, exasperated officials at the Association of Public Health Laboratories sent a letter to the FDA, basically asking permission for state labs to develop their own tests. Within days, the FDA reversed its previous position and said both public and private labs could conduct testing.

Trump continued to insist the virus would die out on its own. “One day, it’s like a miracle. It will disappear,” he predicted Feb. 27.

By then, experts say, the opportunity to halt the relentless spread of the virus within the U.S. population had been lost.

On Feb. 29, only 472 patients had been tested nationwide, with just 22 cases confirmed, according to CDC data. Of those, nine cases were not related to travel but had spread person-to-person within the U.S.

By comparison, South Korea had its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on Jan. 20, the same day as the U.S. Officials there used a test that focused on the same gene targets as the WHO test, according to the website of a test manufacturer. They then quickly permitted private-sector labs to run the samples. As a result, a nation with less than one-sixth the population of the U.S. mobilized to test more than 20,000 people a day.

South Korea also instituted drive-thru centers, allowing quicker identification of those who were infected but might not be displaying symptoms, thus slowing the emergence of new cases to a more manageable level.

Meanwhile, the rate of U.S. infections soared.

“The system is not really geared to what we need right now, what you are asking for,” Fauci conceded during a congressional hearing earlier this month. “That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”

___

SHIFTING BLAME

As public outrage over the lack of available U.S. tests grew, the FDA announced it would allow private diagnostic lab companies to produce new tests without preauthorization from regulators.

Trump and HHS Secretary Alex Azar visited the CDC lab in Atlanta on March 6, praising the agency’s performance and promising 4 million test kits would be available by the end of the following week.

That lofty number didn’t match the ability of U.S. labs to process tests, however. Private providers were just then ramping up, while CDC and state health labs processed about 25,200 COVID-19 tests in the following seven days, according to CDC data.

At the same news conference, Trump said he wanted infected passengers to remain on a cruise ship off the West Coast to keep the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S. low.

“I like the numbers being where they are,” Trump said, shortly before departing Atlanta for another weekend of golf in Florida. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault.”

Trump has also attempted to mislay blame for the testing troubles on the Obama administration. In 2018, Trump disbanded the White House directorate charged with preparing for and responding to global pandemics.

“I don’t take responsibility at all,” Trump replied when asked about the testing shortfall in a March 13 briefing at the White House.

Morrison said Trump appears to see the virus as a political issue rather than a public health threat.

“You can imagine a White House that said, ‘Do whatever it takes to test everybody for the virus,’” he said. “That wasn’t the mentality. It was the opposite mentality, and ultimately the responsibility to protect the American people lies with the White House.”

Trump and other officials have falsely said they declined to use the WHO test because it isn’t reliable.

“Quality testing for our American people is paramount to us,” Deborah Birx, who is coordinating the U.S. coronavirus response, said last week. “It doesn’t help to put out a test where 50% or 47% are false positives.”

“It was a bad test,” Trump chimed in.

Tarik Jašarević, a WHO spokesman, told the AP last week that his agency had shipped 1.5 million testing kits manufactured in Germany to 120 countries around the globe, with no such problems emerging.

“The test has been validated in three external laboratories, adapted by WHO and manufactured in line with international quality standards,” he said. “It has shown consistently good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false-positive nor false-negative results have been reported.”

Over the past two weeks, U.S. testing capacity has surged, with private companies joining in. LabCorp began providing tests March 5, and Quest Diagnostics followed four days later. Tests also are being conducted at hospitals and other centers.

With the increased testing has come a skyrocketing number of confirmed cases, zooming from 43 at the beginning of March to 33,404 by Monday.

Only in the last few days has the United States finally begun testing more people each day than far smaller South Korea, according to data complied by Johns Hopkins University.

Jha estimates the U.S. should be testing 100,000 to 150,000 people per day — figures he said should be obtainable given the number of high-quality diagnostic labs in the country.

“We certainly have the capacity. It’s just we’re not doing it,” Jha said Thursday. “We are up to about 40,000 tests per day now — and so we are moving in the right direction. Still far from where we need to be, but moving.”

The board, met with the Dickinson County Sheriff, the county’s emergency services and the Dickinson-Iron District Health Department, in a special meeting Monday.

""What we're doing is just getting ahead of the game. This is more of less for us to if we need certain resources of funding, we are able to tap into that,” said Brian Bousley, the Dickinson County Controller.

Dickinson is the first county in Upper Michigan to pass a resolution like this, though no coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the county.

""With the state doing it, and the federal level too, I'm sure other counties will follow suit,” said Bousley.

The emergency services deputy director for Dickinson County, Pete Schlitt, saying that this decision may allow the county some resources in the future.

""First responders are the priority, they're the ones that are going out in the field. They're the ones that are out in contact with everybody,” said Schlitt.

The Dickinson County Sheriff, Scott Rutter, says emergency personal is also taking precautions.

""In the correctional center we've made a lot of changes, right down from the cleaning of the facility, several times a day, we do have a screening process.” said Sheriff Rutter.

Sheriff Rutter says they are focused on safety of all, but will keep responding as long as they can.

""We're still going to respond, we're still going to answers people's complaints, calls for service in general,” he said.

While the courthouse remains open, the county encourages people to conduct business by mail or telephone as much as possible.

No confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus, have been reported in Genesee or Lapeer counties. The emergency declarations allows them to obtain state resources to combat its spread.

Genesee County Board of Commissioners Chairman Martin Cousineau announced the declaration Friday afternoon after President Donald Trump declared a national State of Emergency.

“The safety of county residents remains my top priority. Today’s emergency declaration will grant the county access to resources provided by the state and federal government and put us in a state of formal preparedness,” said Cousineau.

The Genesee County Health Department says 17 people in the county have been tested. Nine of those tests came back negative and officials were waiting for results of eight more, according to Health Officer John McKellar.

Lapeer County Board of Commissioners Chairman Gary Roy, along with Emergency Management Director Mary Piorunek, made the declaration Friday afternoon, as well.

Public health officials in both counties are in constant contact with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and federal health officials.

Coronavirus symptoms include mild to severe respiratory illness, fever, cough and shortness of breath. The best ways to prevent coronavirus and other viruses include:

-- Washing hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds.

-- Avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.

-- Covering to cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.

LANSING – Licensed food and beverage establishments in Ingham County must cut their capacity by 50% to lower the risk of spreading coronavirus.

Ingham County Health Officer Linda Vail on Sunday afternoon announced the order, which is aimed to prevent spread of the coronavirus. The order took effect immediately.

""We must take strong and proactive action at this time,"" Vail said.

Vail's announcement follows Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's executive order barring most gatherings of more than 250 people. Ingham County, which as of mid-day Sunday had only one confirmed case of the coronavirus, becomes the second Michigan county to cut capacity of bars and restaurants by 50% after Oakland County did so on Saturday.

Vail's announcement also follows several days of MSU students lined up outside and packed into East Lansing's downtown bars, which prompted East Lansing city officials on Saturday to advocate for tighter restrictions on gatherings.

Since MSU announced last week that most classes would be taught online rather than in person, students have been congregating at bars, sometimes creating block-long lines. City officials' concerns were heightened by the approach of St. Patrick's Day, which is Tuesday.

Lines outside bars, restaurants 'a different situation'

Many East Lansing establishments have a legal capacity less than 250 people, but East Lansing officials were concerned nonetheless.

Some took their worries public in Saturday posts to social media. City Council Member Jessy Gregg posted a photo to Facebook showing a mid-day line stretching outside The Riv, a bar on M.A.C. Avenue.

The line had disbursed by 3 p.m. Saturday following public calls from council members for students and business owners to abide by social distancing. A Riv employee declined to comment.

""You can't have six feet of social distance when you're elbow to elbow in a bar,"" East Lansing Mayor Ruth Beier observed on Saturday.

Making ends meet: The wages are low for Lansing retail workers. The risks for coronavirus exposure are high.

The mayor also suggested on Saturday that the city was exploring the legality of options including a temporary prohibition on alcohol sales or a temporary shutdown of bars.

“The real concern is not about today, but tonight,"" City Council Member Aaron Stephens, himself a recent MSU graduate, said on Saturday afternoon. ""The MSU students, I hate to say this, but they are using this as an excuse to go out and party. Now is not the time to do that.”

By Saturday night, MSU President Samuel Stanley, himself a medical doctor, had emailed the student body to announce the extension of online only instruction though the end of the semester and to postpone commencement ceremonies.

But while MSU is encouraging students to return to their hometowns, campus officials are keeping residence halls and dining halls running to serve international students and others who can't leave campus before semester's end.

Stanley also used the moment Saturday night to chastise students over images of lines outside bars.

""I want to remind everyone again, that this is a time for personal responsibility and personal hygiene — make smart decisions to keep yourself healthy and please consider those around you,"" Stanley wrote in his letter.

While Vail’s order may further reduce crowds allowed inside restaurants and bars, it does nothing to break up lines outside.

“This is all about indoors,” Vail said. “Outdoors is a different situation.”

Crowd control for lines outside of restaurants and bars is a public safety issue for law enforcement, Vail said.

Beier said city officials are looking at their options.

“In terms of the lines outside, our attorney doesn’t think we have the right to say we can disperse you based on health reasons,” Beier said.

Police officers could disperse lines if they blocked the sidewalk, Beier said.

“It’s a really hard thing to enforce outside,” Beier said. “That’s where we really need people to make the right decision.”

People should stay home and not create unnecessary health risks by standing in line, she said.

“Use your big brains and stay home,” Beier said.

State stepping up enforcement

Meanwhile, state and local law enforcement will begin citing establishments that do not follow Whitmer's executive order, Attorney General Dana Nessel said during a Sunday afternoon news conference. A citation for violating the order is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum $250 day and potentially up to 90 days in jail.

""No one wants to shut down the food and beverage industry but also no one wants the coronavirus,"" Nessel said.

The attorney general said she expects local law enforcement will forward any potential cases to her office.

The state has not yet cited a business for violating the executive order, Nessel said.

And bars and restaurants that ignore the executive order could face consequences beyond the misdemeanor citation, Nessel said. Further actions could include the loss of liquor licenses or the closure of their businesses.

""The consequences down the road may be severe,"" Nessel said.

Meanwhile, both the governors of Ohio and Illinois ordered all their state's bars and restaurants to close in an effort to fight the coronavirus. In Ohio, closings were ordered to start at 9 p.m. on Sunday and in Illinois at midnight Monday.

Michigan,Jackson,43907.70278,https://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/2020/03/jackson-declares-state-of-emergency-opens-hand-washing-stations-to-fight-spread-of-coronavirus.html,"Jackson declares state of emergency, opens hand-washing stations to fight spread of coronavirus","JACKSON, MI – Jackson Mayor Derek Dobies has declared a state of emergency in response to the spread of COVID-19. It’s the first time in the city’s history such an emergency declaration has been made, Jackson spokesman Aaron Dimick said.

The announcement was made the morning of Tuesday, March 17, shortly before Jackson County announced its first positive test for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.

""It is a precautionary measure,"" Dimick said. ""If this is something that spreads through Jackson County over the next couple weeks, this could be a huge drain on our city services.""

As mayor, Dobies can unilaterally call a state of emergency, Dimick said. City officials worked with Jackson County Emergency Management officials before making the announcement.

The state of emergency doesn’t trigger many tangible changes, but does show the community that the city is dedicating resources to the issue, Dimick said. It also makes it easier for the city to receive state or federal aid to address the situation.

City workers are setting up hand-washing and hand-sanitizing stations around Jackson on Tuesday afternoon as a measure to fight the spread of the virus. The city is renting portable stations from Lester Brothers and setting them up at the following 10 locations:

Blackman Park at CP Federal City Square, 212 W. Michigan Ave. (hand-washing)

Boos Center at the parking lot near Edgewood Street, 210 Gilbert St. (hand-washing)

City Hall front lobby, 161 W. Michigan Ave. (sanitizing stand)

Jackson Interfaith Shelter, 414 S. Blackstone St. (hand-washing)

Kiwanis Park under the pavilion, 1521 Blakely Ave. (sanitizing stand)

New Leaf Park near the walking trail, 2012 Fourth St. (sanitizing stand)

Elnora Moorman Park near the walking trail, East High Street and Milwaukee Street (sanitizing stand)

Reed Manor, 301 Steward Ave. (hand-washing)

Second Missionary Baptist Church fellowship hall, 304 E. Prospect St. (sanitizing stand)

Downtown Jackson bus station, 127 W. Cortland St. (hand-washing)

A hand-sanitizing station has been set up at Jackson City Hall, 161 W. Michigan Ave.

The city also canceled its City Council meeting scheduled for March 17, as well as all other upcoming meetings. Officials are looking into ways to host the meetings remotely so people can watch and still participate in public comment – perhaps by calling in, Dimick said.

Any special meetings will be announced with a few days notice, he said.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has banned gatherings of more than 250 people, ordered all K-12 schools shut down and barred restaurants from offering dine-in service as measures to fight the spread of the disease. Health officials urge residents to stay home as much as possible and practice social distancing.

PREVENTION TIPS

Michigan’s State Emergency Operations Center is coordinating state-government resources and the response to the coronavirus spread. It has shared the following tips:

What you can do to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases:

· Always cover coughs or sneezes with a tissue or sleeve.

· Stay home if you are sick and advise others to do the same.

· Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

· Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

· Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.

· Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if soap and warm water are not available.

· Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces (computers, keyboards, desks, etc.).

· It’s not too late to get your flu shot! While the influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19 infection, it can help keep you healthy during the flu season.

LAPEER — Lapeer County Board of Commissioner Chairman Gary Roy, along with Emergency Management Director Mary Piorunek have declared a local State of Emergency for Lapeer County.

“Although Lapeer County does not have any confirmed cases of coronavirus (COVID-19) as of this writing, we are not immune to it happening here,” said Piorunek. “This declaration will allow us to leverage any resources we may need to request from the State, allowing us to quickly assist our residents should the coronavirus spread to our community.”

Four more people have tested positive in Michigan for the coronavirus, bringing the total to 16. The four new cases, announced this afternoon, include residents of Wayne and Washtenaw counties. Other cases have been reported in Oakland and St. Clair counties.

President Donald Trump today declared a national emergency to free up billions of dollars to combat the coronavirus.

Lapeer County emergency-response officials urge the public to stay alert to symptoms of COVID-19: fever of 100.4 or higher, cough and/or shortness of breath. “If any develop, stay at home and promptly call a healthcare provider or hospital prior to arriving so that the appropriate preventative measures can be put in place,” said Piorunek. “Visit Lapeer County’s website at www.lapeercountyweb.org for regularly updated information to this evolving situation, as well as valuable resources to help you be part of the solution.”

Monroe Mayor Robert Clark issued a ""State of Emergency"" Sunday for the city in response to the coronavirus outbreak.

This is in addition to, and goes beyond, the notice he issued earlier closing all city-owned offices and buildings to the public at mid-day Friday. Sunday's notice sets into place formal procedures to work with regional and state officials on a response plan.

Monroe County's first coronavirus case was confirmed late Saturday by state and Monroe County health officials.

City of Monroe was the first local government entity in Monroe County to take either an office closing or a State of Emergency issuance to the situation. Clark plans to address area residents during the regularly scheduled Monroe City Council meeting tonight, which is 7:30 p.m. The meeting will be shown live on the City’s YouTube channel and also on the government channel, 18/Comcast or 190/Charter.

The notice is as follows:

Over the past several weeks, City Council and Administration has been continuously reviewing the City's response plan in relation to the Coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, including those measures announced in the past few days. It has become overwhelmingly obvious that our preparations and response will require a more formal incident command structure to direct the City resources necessary to protect the health and safety of our residents.

As such, on Sunday, March 15, at 6:00PM, Mayor Robert E. Clark signed a declaration of a State of Emergency in the City of Monroe. This declaration triggers the City’s internal organizational response as outlined and authorized in Chapter 52 of the City Code by creating the Office of Emergency Preparedness, activating the Emergency Operations Center, and the appointment of an Emergency Preparedness Coordinator to monitor developments and oversee the distribution of city resources as needed.

The Declaration of Emergency reads as such:

“Therefore, I hereby declare a State of Emergency exists in the City of Monroe and direct the following:

Activation of the City's Emergency Operations Plan and the establishment of the Office of Emergency Preparedness.

I ask the City Council to appoint City Manager Vince Pastue as the Emergency Preparedness Coordinator. The Coordinator shall coordinate the activities of the agencies, departments and individuals within the City to protect the public health, safety and welfare during this emergency.

The Coordinator shall designate an Emergency Management Liaison to work with Monroe County Emergency Management on all matters pertaining to emergency management within the City of Monroe.

The Coordinator shall designate officers from City departments having responsibilities for emergency management.”

The full resolution of this action can be found on our web site.

Mayor Clark: “Administration, with the support of City Council, has been working diligently over the past several days to prepare for the inevitable moment the Coronavirus outbreak reaches our community. With the confirmation of the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in Monroe County announced last evening, I am issuing this Declaration of Emergency to aid the City in battling this highly infectious disease. This will create a more nimble and flexible government that is capable of meeting the challenges our community may face as this pandemic evolves. These decisions are not taken lightly, and are made with the health and welfare of all members of our community as a top priority and responsibility.”

City of Monroe administration has been working closely with the Monroe County Health Department (MCHD) and Monroe County Emergency Management Division (MCEMD) during this pandemic. Both the MCHD and the MCEMD are currently operating under the emergency declaration of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, as commenced on March 10, 2020.

Residents are encouraged to watch the City Council meeting tomorrow, Monday, March 16, at 7:30 PM for further information, including an additional statement from Mayor Clark. Council meetings are streamed live on the City’s YouTube channel and also on the government channel, 18/Comcast or 190/Charter.

The public should regularly monitor the City’s website (www.monroemi.gov), Facebook page, app push notifications, the city’s government channel: channel (18/Comcast or 190/Charter), and local media for updates.

City administration will continue to evaluate how to reallocate staff and resources in the most efficient way possible and monitor the situation as it may pertain to the operations of public facilities. Any changes in addition to those released in recent days will be announced via the communication methods highlighted above.

As a reminder, everyone should be taking the following precautions to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, including, but not limited to:

If you think you have been exposed to COVID-19, call your health care provider. If you do not have a health care provider, call the nearest hospital. Wash your hands often with soap and warm water for 20 seconds. If not available, use hand sanitizer. Regularly clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or upper sleeve when coughing or sneezing. Avoid contact with people who are sick. If you are sick, stay home, and avoid contact with others. Replace handshakes with elbow bumps. Stay at least 6 feet away from others when in a public setting (social distancing).

Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus and CDC.gov/Coronavirus.

Carr of Lakeview this afternoon signed a local state of emergency declaration, following Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s state of emergency declaration on March 10 amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

County residents should not panic at the phrase “local state of emergency” — it just means the county’s emergency operations plan has officially been activated, county officials are working to slow the spread of COVID-19, and the county may be eligible for state funding if all county resources are exhausted. Montcalm County currently has one documented case of COVID-19 and that resident has been recovering at home.

County boards, city commissions, township boards and village councils may continue to have public meetings at their discretion at this time.

In the meantime, Montcalm County government offices remain open, albeit with a few reduced and/or revamped services.

“It’s fluid and evolving very fast,” Carr said. “As of right now, it’s our intention to stay open. We’d like to try to remain open, there’s a critical element with each office, they are all essential services and they’d be hard to close completely We are trying to remain open and still try to exercise precautions to keep our employees and residents safe and healthy.”

Gretchen Whitmer’s statewide “stay-at-home” order issued Monday.

MCC has suspended all on-campus operations until Sunday, May 3, according to a news release issued by MCC President Dale K. Nesbary.

“These decisions were made mindful of the continued the safety and well-being of the MCC community, while allowing our students to complete coursework for the current semester,” Nesbary said in a released statement. “I understand how these changes impact the lives of our community members and I am extraordinarily impressed with how our, faculty, students, staff and Board of Trustees have responded to this crisis.”

Whitmer ordered a three-week shelter-in-place mandate on Monday, which went into effect at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, March 24. Since the first positive cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Michigan on March 10, the governor has closed schools, bars, restaurants and other establishments to prevent the virus from spreading further.

Muskegon County was one of several counties in the state to report its first confirmed positive case on Monday. It now has two. The total number of positive cases in Michigan stood at more than 1,300 as of Tuesday afternoon.

Tuesday, March 24: Latest developments on coronavirus in Michigan

Nesbary ended all in-person classes at MCC on March 12, transitioning classes to a “distant learning"" format. The college suspended all on-site operations on March 19 until at least April 5, with plans to later re-evaluate for a possible extension. That extension now is May 3.

The MCC facilities affected by the suspension include the main campus at 221 Quarterline Road, the MCC Ottawa Center, the Sturrus Technology Center, the Lakeshore Fitness Center and the Lakeshore Fab Lab.

Michigan,Oscoda,,http://www.iosconews.com/news/article_53fa7780-4cef-11ea-88c9-1f858c2a7635.html,Oscoda approves sending letter of interest to MAMA,"OSCODA – The Michigan Aerospace Manufacturers Association (MAMA) is on the hunt for a command and control center site, and Oscoda Township has thrown its hat into the ring.

The board of trustees voted unanimously at their Monday meeting to send a letter of interest to MAMA, regarding a satellite command and control communications center to support the launch and daily operations of satellites.

Superintendent Dave Schaeffer shared with the board the Jan. 28 MAMA press release, which was summarized in the Feb. 5 edition of this publication.

He told officials that MAMA is accepting letters of interest related to the command and control center through this Friday, Feb. 14, and he is seeking the approval of trustees to submit such a letter on behalf of Oscoda, prior to the deadline.

“The township board previously approved a letter of interest to MAMA concerning the opportunities associated with both the horizontal launch and vertical launch facilities,” Schaeffer added.

Similar to the township’s response to those components, he said there is a new component for the satellite command and control communications center.

“Just as we submitted a letter of interest, they came back and gave us an RFI – a request for information – which was a whole detail of all the information that they need to be able to make a decision on the site associated with satellite command and control communications,” Schaeffer elaborated.

“So, just as we went through that letter of interest to responding to the RFI, this is to submit that letter of interest. If they choose us, as far as the RFI, then we would get the RFI at a later date,” he continued.

Since the last board meeting, he and Economic Improvement Director Todd Dickerson attended a spaceport facilities site visit in Cape Canaveral, Fla. Also taking part were Oscoda-Wurtsmith Airport (OWA) Manager Gary Kellan and OWA Authority member Dave Dailey.

The delegation was held Feb. 4-7, and MAMA invited its members to participate in the event.

The visit included stops at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, Patrick Air Force Base and other commercial space companies within the Cape Canaveral area.

Schaeffer noted that the Kennedy Space Center visit also entailed a tour of the vehicle assembly building.

According to the NASA website, the iconic facility serves as the central hub of NASA’s premier multi-user spaceport, capable of hosting several different kinds of rockets and spacecraft at the same time.

Schaeffer told board members that it was very interesting to meet some of the other players associated with the spaceport who are currently operating in Cape Canaveral, and what that ecosystem would look like for the next steps in the spaceport.

He also said he and Dickerson were informed that the new date for the announcement – on the horizontal component for the MAMA/Michigan Launch Initiative (MLI) – will be Tuesday, Feb. 18. “And so we are hopeful that the announcement goes in the community’s favor.”

As reported, following the MLI site visit in Oscoda last year, it was revealed that the preferred spaceport location in the state would be announced in early January.

Township officials were expecting to hear at their Jan. 27 meeting whether the community had been chosen as the Michigan site of a potential spaceport operation. Schaeffer, however, advised that the decision had been bumped back again, after the announcement was initially supposed to come on Jan. 2, and then on Jan. 22.

As Kellan has pointed out, MAMA Executive Director Gavin Brown indicated that the goal is to bring the governor’s office up to speed on the project before any formal announcement of the selected sites. Therefore, getting on the governor’s schedule has been a driving factor in this.

Brown says MAMA has been engaged in Phase I work on the MLI, which involves the feasibility of sites for both vertical and horizontal launch capabilities. When an announcement is made regarding the site(s) which meet and exceed the highest value, this location will serve as the basis to move forward with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) licensing for a spaceport for both/individually, vertical and horizontal launches serving LEO/MEO/suborbital, polar orbit demand.

Upon choosing the Michigan spaceport site – be it in Oscoda or elsewhere – the candidate will then have to compete nationally for licensing through the FAA Space System program.

As noted in MAMA’s Jan. 28 press release, with the rapid development of horizontal and vertical space launch facilities coming to Michigan, the association is collaborating with partners such as the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the Michigan National Guard to build a command and control center to support the launch and daily operations of satellites.

The news release announced the start of a location search for a command and control center to manage commercial satellite operations and provide U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) support to such branches as Space Force.

As noted in the document, Michigan is leading Mid-America’s space efforts by creating an ecosystem of space technology, launch facilities and now a space communications ground support station. The high-tech communications center will be an important growth contributor to Michigan and the surrounding region economies, serving the LEO, MEO and hypersonic space industries.

“As we continue to build Michigan’s international space influence with technology, manufacturing, and launch assets, providing a communications telemetry center will enhance our leadership growth in the space satellite industry,” Brown stated. “Providing a complete ecosystem of value to the commercial and DoD space marketplace is what we are building.”

As for the command and control center, RFIs and the requirements detailing the process will be provided to qualified applicants, and site submissions will be evaluated on a variety of technical, economic and physical factors.

According to those from MAMA, the developing space industry in the state also complements its past and present leadership in the automotive industry. With satellites providing the future communications for autonomous vehicle technology, Michigan’s expansion into the space industry insures its technological edge for ground vehicles.

VAN BUREN COUNTY, Mich.—The Van Buren County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution asking that the state declare a state of emergency due to shoreline erosion.

The resolution, passed on January 14, says that the “record high water levels in the Great Lakes as well as the bays and rivers connected to them have contributed toward major erosion on beaches and shorelines across the state of Michigan.”

Van Buren County is asking the state to declare the 3,288 miles of Michigan shoreline a disaster area in order to receive assistance from the federal government for “the devastating situation which has an impact statewide.”

Stretches of sand up and down the western Michigan coast is now gone, largely due to high lake levels.

In November, Berrien County’s Board of Commissioners passed its own proposal to ask for the same shoreline area disaster declaration.

“This is not just a problem down here in New Buffalo, this is all the way up and down the Great Lakes shoreline,” Berrien County Commissioner Ezra Scott said in November.",disaster_declaration,75455

See Morgan’s full statement below:

“For the health and safety of all residents of Washtenaw County and for the long-term stability of our local economy, public safety and criminal justice system and community social safety net, I am declaring a state of emergency. This public health emergency is unprecedented, touching every aspect of our lives, and some members of our community will need assistance meeting their basic needs, especially due to the closures of businesses and the dwindling availability of basic necessities.

""The declaration of a state-of-emergency will formally activate channels of communication and coordination. We want to ensure that we are doing absolutely everything we can to support our county now and to mitigate long-term effects. This allows us to fully utilize resources made available by the state and federal government while also layering on local resources to help provide services to anyone who may need them.”

Minnesota,Brown,43908,https://www.nujournal.com/news/local-news/2020/03/18/state-of-emergency-in-brown-county/,State of emergency in Brown County,"BROWN COUNTY — Brown County commissioners passed a state of emergency declaration Tuesday.

The declaration made on a motion by Commissioner Scott Windschitl, seconded by Commissioner Tony Berg, must be made for Brown County to be able to apply for possible state and federal assistance for COVID-19 costs. All county departments must track costs for possible reimbursement.

Commissioners also:

• Received an informational update on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) and the role of the public health department in planning and response.

“Because this is a new virus, there are still things we do not know, such as how severe the illness can be, how well it is transmitted between people, and other features of it. We are learning more about it as it evolves. The situation is evolving daily. Information we have today may not be the information we have tomorrow,” read the Brown County Public Health request.

“We are in full emergency operations and incident command mode,” said Brown County Public Health Director Karen Moritz. “It takes all five of us to handle phone calls.”

Moritz said as of Monday, there were 54 Minnesota cases, 4,661 cases and 85 deaths in the United States, 185,067 global cases and 7,330 deaths.

She described disease symptoms as fever, cough and shortness of breath.

“Stay home if you’re sick, cover coughs, wash hands well and avoid face touching,” Moritz said. She urged people to make virtual contact, answering screening questions with their medical facility (Allinahealth.org) to determine if testing is needed before calling or going to see a doctor.

“You don’t have to test just because you are sick. Eighty percent of cases are mild,” Moritz said. “Prepare for the worst. Hope for the best. Keep calm. Wash your hands often. We are resilient and will work through this. Be kind to each other. Check on the elderly.”

The Minnesota Department of Public Health hotline is 651-201-3920.

Commissioners also:

• Unanimously approved a design engineer proposal to rehabilitate Bridge 6534 on State Highway 13 over the Little Cottonwood River, motion by Windschitl, seconded by Berg. The bridge was built in 1953, widened in 1977 and is in satisfactory condition.

It does not have concrete approach panels. It has twist-down guard rail that is not recommended anymore. This segment of State Highway 13 is planned for concrete overlay in 2021.

The State Aid Bridge Office was contacted to see if the bridge needs any special treatment with a concrete overlay on the approach. The office determined concrete approach panels should be added to each end of the bridge to protect it from concrete overlay.

The office suggested that end blocks be inspected and possibly repaired since the design has had end blocks fail. Brown County has two bridges where concrete end blocks failed and had to be repaired.

A consultant is required to design approach panels and end block repair if needed plus design the guard rail to current standards. Erickson Engineering made a proposal to inspect the bridge for a $1,100 estimated fee. Cost of the bridge rehabilitation design and plans was estimated at $20,600.

• Appointed New Ulm Assistant City Engineer Joe Stadtheim as the Brown County Planning Commission District 1 Commissioner, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Windschitl.

• Unanimously approved a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) application by Brad Gaard, Section 4, Sigel Township to continue to allow operation of a manufacturing and machine shop including a lathe and milling machine as a home occupation in an accessory structure, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Veerkamp.

• A CUP application by Arland Roiger, Section 33, North Star Township and Section 5, Stately Township to allow use of an existing gravel mine to include crushing and/or screening, gravel extraction and processing, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Borchert.

Commissioners received a letter dated March 15 from Gary and Pat Roiger complaining about gravel hauling dust on weekends and questioned the need to haul gravel on weekends.

• A CUP application by Matthew J. Dorfner of MICB Inc., on property owned by Loren J. and Yvonne Gage, Section 9, Cottonwood Township, to allow use of an existing 110-foot radio transmission tower for a Christian-related radio station, motion by Commissioner Veerkamp, seconded by Commissioner Berg.

• A CUP application by Andrew Schmidt, Section 19, Burnstown Township, to continue to allow use of a 40 foot by 85 foot office building to include an employee equipment storage shop for a masonry business, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Veerkamp.

• Preliminary plat applications filed by Bruce Pace, 6.32 acres, Section 26, Linden Township, to adjust the current building site, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Windschitl; filed by Charles Waibel, Section 33, Sigel Township, to separate the building site from tillable acres, motion by Commissioner Berg, seconded by Commissioner Simonsen.

• By a 3-2 vote with Commissioners Simonsen and Berg dissenting, refused a request to move the Brown County Probation Juvenile Crew Leader position to full-time status and reduce the Sentence to Service crewleader positions from two to one.

Commissioner Windschitl made the motion, seconded by Commissioner Veerkamp, to refuse the request. Windschitl said he didn’t see the benefit of making the change and that the initial financial savings would not last.

The request was made due to retirement of the current half-time plus juvenile crew leader and to post a vacancy for a full-time crew leader position. County savings was estimated at $13,584.

• Unanimously approved a recommendation of the Wetlands Ad Hoc Committee of clarifying the April 18, 2017 decision that the Notice of Decision is valid in perpetuity, so long as the applicant’s activity described in the application commences within three years of the decision, motion by Commissioner Simonsen, seconded by Commissioner Berg.

The decision stems from a wetland impact evaluation, irrigation well pumping test, no loss determination regarding a water appropriation permit application by Jason Cunningham, Stark Township.

In a Dec. 20, 2016, letter to Brown County Wetland Administrator John Knisely, Principal Hydrogeologist Daniel Whitney, P.G. of Northwest Aqwatek Solutions, LLC (NWATS), wrote “no impact to the to the wetland will occur from utilizing an irrigation well at a rate of about 450 gallons per minute for crop production during the growing season that supports the assertion of a no-loss determination for the wetland.

The permit involves a wetland adjacent to the Cunningham farm field related to cropland irrigation. The three-acre wetland was classified as a Type 1 Wetland that periodically contains surface water, particularly during early spring, but is often farmed during dry periods.

Due to the proximity of the wetland to the respective irrigation well, Brown County required Cunningham to complete a Minnesota Wetland Conservation Act joint application in accordance with Minnesota Rule 8420.0415 (Appendix D).

The decision comes as the state’s number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase, including reaching rural counties in central and southern Minnesota.

On Monday, Minnesota confirmed 19 new cases of the novel coronavirus, for a statewide total of 54.

By declaring a local state of emergency, Cook County’s emergency management department can request funding from, and work in cooperation with other agencies, including from the state and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The board passed a resolution on a 4-0 vote to adopt the resolution declaring a state of emergency in Cook County.

Commissioner Dave Mills was absent from today’s meeting. Mills is returning home from a trip to Costa Rica this week with a group of local students from the Great Expectations School in Grand Marais.

Originally scheduled for a committee of the whole work session, the board opted to convene in a regular session today so they could take action on specific resolutions regarding COVID-19 and vote on matters of significance, according to Board Chair Myron Bursheim.

The county also passed an advanced sick-leave policy during today’s meeting, as well as a temporary telework policy for some county employees. Human Resources Director Pam Dixon explained the objectives and reasoning behind these temporary changes to how local government will function.

WTIP’s Joe Friedrichs spoke with Interim-County Administrator Rena Rogers for an update on how the coronavirus could, and is impacting Cook County government.

The Faribault County Commissioners met for an emergency meeting by phone to enact two resolutions regarding the current COVID-19 pandemic affecting the United States.

The first resolution declares Faribault County in a State of Emergency for the next 30 days with the option to extend the time period if necessary.

The purpose of the resolution is to allow Faribault County to request needed resources from the state and federal level in order to mitigate and recover from the current COVID-19 public health emergency.

County Board members also passed a resolution limiting access to county buildings.

Beginning at 8 a.m. on Thursday, March 19, all Faribault County facilities doors will be locked until further notice. Public access will be severely limited to specific reasons only.

The Kandiyohi County Board of Commissioners approved the declaration at an emergency meeting Thursday. As part of the state of emergency, the commissioners approved closing the county Health and Human Services Building and also the County Office Building in downtown Willmar to the general public starting Friday.

""The County Board has the authority to close buildings, limit access and reduce hours,"" said County Administrator Larry Kleindl.

The declaration will remain in effect until at least April 13, when the county's medical emergency team will re-evaluate the situation.

This order does not impact the county courthouse, the Law Enforcement Center or the child care center located on the bottom floor of the Health and Human Services building. That being said, Kandiyohi County Sheriff Eric Holien said after the meeting that the LEC is also restricting access and people should call before coming down.

While the buildings might be closed to the public for the most part, business continues for the county.

""Our employees will still be reporting,"" Kleindl said.

The plan is for staff to do as much as it can through the phone or online. Customers who need to drop off forms or payments will be able to use drop boxes at both locations.

For those that must meet with a county employee, they should call the correct department and set up an interview. When they arrive at the building, the employee meeting with the individual will come downstairs to let the person in the building.

Social distancing will be practiced, which includes trying to leave at least 6 feet between people. The county is hoping for state and federal waivers regarding some of its services, so the meetings between client and county could be done remotely.

""We are trying to make this as flexible as possible,"" Kleindl said.

If anyone has any questions they are asked to call. A list of phone numbers for county departments can be found on the county's website at kcmn.us.

""We know this a difficult time, this is the first time for all of us,"" Kleindl said. ""We want to work with you the best we can. We know this will be a challenge for some of us. We're going to do whatever we can to make this work.""

Kleindl thanked the county staff members for all of their work and sacrifices during this uncertain time and doing what they can to keep the public safe while still providing county services.

""Our staff is doing a tremendous job,"" Kleindl said. ""I know these are difficult times. We, administration and the board, are asking a lot of you.""

The county commissioners are also urging members of the public to do what they can to make these situations easier. Commissioner Harlan Madsen asked everyone to get their information from reputable sources and not from a Facebook post. And he also wants people to keep their mental health in mind.

In a statement to the West Central Tribune following the meeting, Commissioner Steve Ahmann urged people to stay optimistic and not give into hate.

""Our country has overcome in the past and we can overcome together. Fear is a powerful motivator and I encourage everyone to cast out fear and negative speculation. Negative thoughts and blaming others can turn into hate,"" Ahmann said. ""Our country does not need fear and hate to contaminate us now. Stay positive and be optimistic.""",state_of_emergency,42410

Minnesota,Nobles,,https://www.dglobe.com/news/government-and-politics/5004871-Nobles-County-declares-state-of-emergency-acts-on-building-closures-to-public-access,"Nobles County declares state of emergency, acts on building closures to public access","WORTHINGTON — In a special meeting Wednesday morning, Nobles County commissioners took official action to declare a state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Their unanimous vote now sets into motion documentation by county staff as it relates to the response to the virus.

As of Wednesday morning, there were no reported cases of COVID-19 in Nobles County, but numbers of cases continue to rise in the state and around the country.

Nobles County Administrator Tom Johnson explained that the documentation is necessary if costs related to emergency response would ever be reimbursed by the state or federal government. This could include the purchase of medical equipment without prior authorization and without going through the bid process, it was explained.

Board Chairman Justin Ahlers signed a temporary declaration late Tuesday afternoon, as plans were taking shape to close county office buildings to the public.

On Wednesday, the board took official action to close county buildings to the public. The buildings include the Nobles County Government Center in downtown Worthington, the Nobles County and Adrian branch libraries and the Nobles County Public Works facility.

“All employees are to report to work at this time,” Ahlers said, noting that a relaxed dress code is in place as employees will use the time to clean up areas within their offices and buildings.

Access to county services is available to the public via phone or email. Information and links to all departments may be found at co.nobles.mn.us.

The courts, county attorney’s office and Rock-Nobles Community Corrections departments remain open inside the Prairie Justice Center, as required by the Minnesota Supreme Court.

Nobles County Attorney Joe Sanow said the courts will remain open for high priority and super high priority cases, including most felonies.

“It’s mostly business as usual until the Supreme Court says otherwise,” Sanow told commissioners Wednesday.

While there was some discussion about library services, commissioners decided it would be safest to suspend operations at this time and until further notice. The libraries have drop boxes in place for people to return items, but because of the way the virus spreads, they did not want people to be able to check out library items or access the library computers.

Commissioner Matt Widboom pointed out that the library does provide free internet access through wi-fi, and if people want to sit in their vehicles outside the library to access the internet, they are welcome to do so.

There was also discussion about the Ninth Street entrance to the Nobles County Government Center, which provides access to Worthington Public Utilities.

Widboom said he wants all entrances to the building closed to the public, and noted WPU employees have access to their offices without using the public entrance. He also noted they have a payment box and the public can pay their utility bill through the box at this time.

“Closed means closed,” Widboom said.

Johnson said there is plenty of work for county employees to do, even though they won’t be working face-to-face with the public.

“The library’s identified some things that have needed to be done for a while,” he added.

In the community services department, Director Stacie Golombiecki said her staff is “doing everything we can to find creative solutions to meet with people.

“We’re doing a lot of phone contact, and our case managers have made lists of our most vulnerable people and we’ll check in that way,” Golombiecki said. Work that requires home visits — including foster care — will be done through phone check-ins, she added.

With the close working quarters in the community services department, Widboom asked if employees there could spread out their work area.

“Use this room (the boardroom) and any other space you need to spread out, that’s my thought,” Widboom said.

“Generally, everyone can work from a different location in the building,” Golombiecki agreed.

Commissioner Donald Linssen asked if there was a plan in place in the event a county employee contracted the virus, and noted concerns of the virus getting into the government building.

“We’re pulling all the stuff together that has to be done,” Johnson responded. “A formal plan is really challenging because there’s so many unknowns.”

Commissioner Gene Metz asked about employee compensation, should a quarantine be necessary.

“Right now, if an employee doesn’t feel safe here, they are allowed to go home,” responded Human Resources Manager Sue Luing. “They just have to use their benefits — their family leave.”

Tuesday’s Nobles County Board meeting is still planned at this time, though the agenda will only include essential business. That means the public hearing on the proposed half-cent sales tax has been postponed indefinitely. Other agenda items that included reports from outside agencies will also be delayed.

Since the law requires board meetings be open to the public, the plan at this time is to have someone at the front entrance to let people in for the 9 a.m. meeting.

“This is difficult times — especially if you have families and children at home,” said Linssen at the close of Wednesday’s meeting. “There’s a lot of disruption going on.”",state_of_emergency,21617

Some St. Louis County employees will also be required to report to work to help allow for the continuation of essential services.

Other staff members are being given the opportunity to complete duties remotely.

“This is going to be more of a marathon than a sprint. It may be a marathon where the finish line is a moving target. There are going to be hurdles,” said St. Louis County Human Resources Director Jim Gottschald.

One of the hurdles the county is overcoming, with this declaration, is the lack of ease to implement disaster plans.

The local state of emergency allows for the flexibility of county leaders to respond and impose necessary resources to react to this pandemic.

“I think we can be responsive to our workforce and residents in a more uncomplicated fashion where we don’t have to look over existing policies and bring the board for a special discussion,” said County Administrator Kevin Gray.

St. Louis county courthouse in Duluth, Hibbing, and Virginia will remain open.

Only high priority cases will be handled.

All other non-essential cases will be rescheduled at a later date.

Also, solid waste sites will continue servicing the county.

The local state of emergency in St. Louis county holds for a period of three days.

At that point, the board of commissioners would have to revisit the resolution, if necessary.

The next board meeting is scheduled for this Tuesday.",state_of_emergency,200540

ST. CLOUD — Stearns County is now in a state of emergency, which means many of its public buildings will close to reduce social interactions and mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

Stearns County board members held a special meeting Thursday morning and voted unanimously to declare the emergency and delay future board meetings.

The county will close its Administration Building, West Service Center and Melrose Annex to the public. On Thursday, the county's License Centers and Treasurer's Office closed to foot traffic.

Even as they talked about social distancing measures, staff and board members were not all 6 feet apart during the meeting, which was livestreamed online. Board members sat in their usual seats, about an arms-length apart.

Stearns County has between three and five known cases of COVID-19, according to Wednesday figures from the state Department of Health.

For every known case there are between 2.5 and 5 additional cases undiagnosed, Stearns County Public Health Division Director Renee Frauendienst told board members Thursday morning.

She cautioned the number of cases will start to slow down, but it will be a false impression. It's because there aren't enough tests available in the state and not because there's an actual decline in COVID-19 cases.

If you have the symptoms of the coronavirus infection — fever, cough, shortness of breath — you should assume you have it, Frauendienst said.

""We need you to continue doing the social distancing,"" Frauendienst said. ""We know it works.""

Even as the county moves to a state of emergency, most county services will continue.

RELATED: Stearns County coronavirus case confirmed, here's what we know

""We won't close down the county,"" said County Administrator Michael Williams. ""We're not experiencing an extremely high level of expenditure.""

The emergency declaration allows the county to enter into new contracts that help protect people's health and provide emergency aid, according to county documents. And it invokes the county's emergency operations plan.

Staff have gotten creative and will provide services through websites, email, mail, drop boxes, drive-through and by telephone, Williams said. But passports and driver's license services will be on hold.

Employees will work remotely if they can and limit fact-to-face interactions.

Sheriff Steve Soyka and Department of Human Services Administrator Melissa Huberty told board members their offices continue to provide the usual services to the community with precautions to protect staff.

""People are feeling a lot of anxiety,"" said county board member Tarryl Clark. ""It's good for them to know that we're here.""

The board will meet again April 21 and decide whether to extend the emergency.

Alcorn County did the same.

At the height of the storm, 11,000 customers in Alcorn County were without power. That number was down to 1,800 by Monday.

Many trees ares down. Power has been restored to schools but some roads are impassable. Schools in Corinth will reopen Tuesday.

“This has been a devastating ordeal for the city of Corinth,"" Public Works Director Clayton Mills said. ""It’s been a long time since we had a situation like this.”

The damage is widespread, with trees scattered everywhere, power lines down and roads closed.

Corinth city leaders believe straight line winds from a storm Saturday caused most of this damage.

Monday, everyone was thankful no one was seriously hurt.

“You can just look around here and see the potential for loss of life and injury was great,"" said Danny Lowery, who was helping his daughter and her neighbors with cleanup. ""We’re just thankful we didn’t have any.”

Although his daughter is without power and likely won’t have it restored this week, the family is focusing on the positive.

""We’re thankful that we can replace material things and cleanup but it would be hard to replace someone that we lost,” Lowery said.

It’ll be a long cleanup process. City leaders issued a warning.

In the wake of Friday's announcement that there are six cases of coronavirus in Mississippi and three are in Forrest County, Hattiesburg mayor Toby Barker and Forrest County Board of Supervisors president David Hogan signed documents declaring the response to COVID-19 a local emergency.

Barker said the declaration will keep citizens and first responders safer.

""We know that we are in for a long-term approach in responding to COVID-19, and we know we’ll need the resources to do it,"" Barker said. ""The residents of Hattiesburg deserve our best efforts in keeping them healthy and safe.

A steering committee that formed last week met Wednesday and appointed Lincoln County Emergency Management Director Clifford Galey as the spokesman for the group, which includes his office as well as representatives from the City of Brookhaven, Lincoln County Board of Supervisors, Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office, Brookhaven Police Department, Mississippi Highway Patrol, King’s Daughter Medical Center, Brookhaven School District, Lincoln County School District, Brookhaven Academy and Mississippi School of the Arts.

By declaring an emergency, officials can activate a comprehensive emergency plan that was put in place years ago, but recently updated, Galey said.

The declaration allows the city and county to seek state and federal assistance for medical supplies and other needed supplies.

“In general, it gives everyone a little bit more authority than they would normally have if we were not under this COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.

Galey said he is working with all emergency services to fill any unmet needs that may arise due to the statewide outbreak.

No positive cases have been reported in Lincoln County as of Wednesday afternoon, he said.

Galey urged residents to install the free app MS Ready on mobile devices through either the Apple Store or Google Play Store. The app, created for use by the Mississippi State Department of Health, is available in English, Spanish and Vietnamese.

The app provides up-to-date and accurate disaster information including disease outbreaks such as COVID-19.

“If they see it on that site, it is true information,” he said.

Galey said the county’s upcoming Keep Lincoln County Beautiful Spring Cleanup has been postponed until a later date. The drop-off locations in the five districts throughout the month of April will not be available. Galey urged residents who planned to drop off debris and white goods at one of the locations to keep it on their own property until a new date has been determined.

The Brookhaven Recreation Department and all public parks are closed and all city-sponsored recreational activities have been temporarily canceled.

The upcoming Spring Fling and Fair at the Lincoln Civic Center and all civic center and arena activities have been canceled, he said.

He urged residents to stay at home if possible, but if going out, do so responsibly. He said stores and restaurants are making phone, social media and app ordering more user-friendly and offering drive-thru, curbside and delivery service.

“If you don’t need to go out, don’t go out, but if you go out, support the local businesses that are offering safe ways to shop and dine,” he said.

The Lincoln County-Brookhaven Government Complex will remain open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. However, visitors will notice that area are being cleaned and sanitized more often and workers in some offices will be wearing gloves when handling money and interacting with the public.

Those who exhibit any of the symptoms of a coronavirus — fever, dry cough and shortness of breath or difficulty breathing — should not call for an ambulance or go to the KDMC emergency room.

“If for some reason you think you need to be tested, please call your doctor and set it up through your doctor,” he said. “Do not go through the hospital. They will not accept you there.”

He said individuals should call their primary physician and they will advise the person on the proper procedure that needs to be followed.

“Above all, try to stay calm, practice good hand washing and take regular precautions you would take in flu and cold season,” he said. “The health department’s recommendation of hand washing for 20 seconds with soap and warm water is your best option.”",state_of_emergency,34810

Chad Bergevin, who lives opposite the center, said he had learned of the situation in a text message from a neighbor. “It was like, ‘Wow, this is literally less than a football field away from my house,’” he said, adding that he was surprised to see people still seeming to come and go near the center. “I’m sorry, if it were me, I’d have the place on lockdown,” he said.

The indications of a possible spread, and the involvement of a nursing home marked a new, urgent phase in the response to the virus in the United States, where 70 cases have been reported, and until Saturday, none had been fatal. Most of the cases could be explained by overseas travel or contact with someone who had been ill. This week, though, new cases, in California, Oregon and Washington, were the first in the United States in which the cause was mysterious and unknown — a sign, experts warned, that the virus, which has killed more than 2,800 people worldwide and has sickened more than 86,000 others, might now be spreading in the United States.

In the Northwest, especially, health officials were putting in place new precautions given the new cases. They were already discussing the possibility that they might recommend cancellations of public events. They began warning that life in the coming weeks may undergo dramatic change.

By Saturday, 10 people have been treated in Washington State, including the first case of coronavirus that was diagnosed in the United States, a man in his 30s who had traveled in China and has since recovered; several patients were treated at a Spokane area hospital after returning from a cruise ship in Japan; and the first known coronavirus fatality in the United States, a man in his 50s whose death was announced Saturday.

In announcing the death at a news conference, President Trump said the victim was a “wonderful woman” in her 50s, but local officials later said the patient had been a man in his 50s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention later said that the patient was, in fact, a man, and that the agency had incorrectly described the patient as a woman.

Few details were known about the man who died, except that he had underlying health conditions and had been a patient at a hospital in Kirkland. He was not known to have traveled abroad, or to have had contact with anyone who had tested positive for the virus, adding to growing signs that the coronavirus may be spreading in the United States. He also had no known connection to the nursing home, officials said.",state_of_emergency,49688

(WTVA) — A judge ruled Tuesday that Yalobusha County must hold a special election in two precincts to decide who should be the county's next sheriff.

The decision by Judge Jeff Weill of Hinds County is the result of a hearing over an election challenge filed by Luther Folson, who lost the November general election to Mark Fulco by two votes.

Circuit Clerk Daryl Burney said the precincts where the voting will take place again is Beat 1 North, which includes the Old Depot area of Water Valley, and Beat 4 Oakland.

Results from those two precincts will be added to the general election totals from the other precincts to determine a winner.

Burney did not have a date for the special election, but it is typically 60 days after a judge's ruling.

He added each of those precincts has approximately 1,000 voters.

The judge ruled a special election was necessary because four absentee ballots — two from each precinct — were processed illegally and he could not determine the preference of those four voters.",None,12373

Here’s what that means to citizens,"The Cass County Health Department continues to encourage basic preventative measures including washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. AP

Cass County is under a public health emergency order from the Cass County Health Department until at least April 1 due to CDC recommended precautions in relation to the COVID-19 virus.

The order closes all restaurants and restricts gatherings to fewer than 10 people. Cities within the county have also been worked hard to keep up with the changing situation: putting additional limitations into place, changing court dockets, and canceling meetings and events to protect residents.

Cass County Health Department Director Andrew Warlen issued the emergency order on March 17 to close all restaurants, dining facilities, bars, taverns, clubs and movie theaters in the county. These restrictions are similar to those already in place in neighboring Jackson County, which also prohibits groups of 10 or more from gathering unless it’s related to the normal business operations of a facility.

“We are working to make good decisions for Cass County with partners in the state and the region. We are trying to learn from others, and hopefully that will give us a huge advantage in handling this,” Warlen said.

The order encourages as many businesses as possible to continue with normal operations while paying close attention to CDC recommended practices. Restaurants may continue to provide carry out, curbside, drive-thru and delivery service.

“What we don’t want is all the patrons inside the restaurant. If you think about going to a restaurant: you walk in the door, you touch the tables, you touch the menu, you are often putting food in your mouth, and that’s a great way to spread the virus,” Warlen said.

Warlen explains the fast rate of transmission for the COVID-19 virus is the problem. Public health restrictions are aimed at reducing the rate of people getting sick. The yearly influenza virus similarly makes people sick and does also cause death, but influenza sicknesses generally occur over several months, which can be handled by the local health-care system. The rate of infection with the COVID-19 virus has been very rapid in comparison.

“If we can’t slow it down, everyone is going to become sick at once and it will overwhelm the healthcare system. That’s what we can’t have, and that’s exactly what happened in Italy. Too many people got sick at once,” Warlen said.

The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Cass County came from Drexel.

The Cass County Health Department released limited information about the patient in Drexel, beyond that the patient was compliant with home quarantine and following CDC regulations. The Health Department is working to identify and contact people who may have been in danger of infection because of interaction with the individual.

Throughout the county, cities have also pledged to follow Cass County regulations, while making their own adjustments to court dockets, city business, sports and recreation programming, and events.

The City of Harrisonville closed all city facilities indefinitely and is asking residents to refrain from public gatherings no matter how many people are in attendance. City residents are encouraged to pay utility bills online. The 17th Circuit Municipal court dockets are canceled until April 3. Cases on the docket will get a new court date. Defendants and attorneys will be notified in the mail of the new dates.

Raymore has pledged to stop utility shut offs for 30 days in order to help people who may have a challenge paying bills. However, online bill pay and the drop box are still available for on time payments of bills. Bill payments may also be mailed.

The Raymore Activity Center and Centerview event center are closed until at least March 31. Recreation programming is suspended. Boards and commissions will not have meetings. A Community Little Cleanup scheduled for March 21 as well as the Friday Food Fest scheduled for March 27 were both canceled.

Raymore Communications Manager Melissa Harmer says it is important for cities to pay attention to the latest recommendations from the CDC.

“The only way to stop the spread of COVID-19 is to limit your interaction with other people. We want you to stay home,” Harmer said. “Continue frequent hand washing. Even though you might feel completely healthy, you could still be a carrier.”

While City Hall remains open in Raymore, residents are encouraged to do as much business as possible over the phone or online. Upcoming March and April court dockets have been moved to May in Raymore.

In Belton, Mayor Jeff Davis sent a message to citizens encouraging basic precautionary measures for all residents.

“Please stay home if you begin to feel unwell or experience any of the symptoms like tiredness, dry cough and fever,” Davis said in a message to residents.

Belton has canceled city council meetings scheduled for March 24 and April 14.

The City of Peculiar has suspended all recreation activities and classes through April 13. The Recreation Soccer League, Youth Flag Football League, Youth Volleyball League, Little Soccer Kickers, Total Body Fitness, and Yoga Mind & Body are all included. Peculiar Parks and Recreation will provide all necessary updates to participants and families as they arise.

The Cass County Health Department continues to encourage basic preventative measures including washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. Stay home if you are sick. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces frequently.

Warlen additionally suggests residents take care of those who are older or immune compromised from a distance, only.

“Get their groceries for them. Call them. Skype them. E-mail them. Facebook live them, but keep away from them,” Warlen said.

With the introduction of the coronavirus the district purchased three additional machines to clean 2 million square feet of space inside the district's buildings. Students are scheduled to return Monday from break. Robert Cohen

Missouri Gov. Mike Parson on Friday declared a state of emergency in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus and announced the state has two more presumptive positive cases, bringing the total to four.

One of the new cases is a St. Louis County resident in the 50s who case is believed to be related to domestic travel, Parson said in a statement. Details on the other case have not been released yet.

At a news conference, Parson said he considered declaring the state of emergency “the next appropriate step to protect the public health” and stressed the move was not made because of concerns that the state's health care system is overwhelmed or unprepared.

“The primary purpose of this emergency declaration is to provide greater flexibility in allocating our state resources, not because the local health providers feel they are overwhelmed,” Parson told reporters in his Capitol office.

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

Declaring a state of emergency gives Parson the ability to tap into about $7 million of state disaster funds, which he said can be used for coronavirus response efforts.

Parson also said he did not intend to close the state's schools, as Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker did on Friday. Parson said school districts should seek guidance from local health officials in deciding whether to close schools.

However, the University of Missouri System announced in a Friday statement that in-person classes have been suspended for the rest of the spring semester at the system's flagship campus in Columbia and its three other campuses in Kansas City, St. Louis and Rollo. Campus housing, dining halls, libraries and broadband internet will remain available to students, the statement said.

Also on Friday, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page, who is a physician, banned all events in the county attended by more than 250 people amid a flurry of closures of athletic events, parades and even church services.

Detection efforts also were intensifying. The Mercy health system announced that a drive-thru coronavirus testing facility could open as soon as Saturday in the St. Louis suburb of Chesterfield. Mercy said it also plans to open more testing sites in Missouri and the other three states where it operates — Arkansas, Kansas and Oklahoma.

Meanwhile, a Missouri health department spokeswoman said the agency is working to fix a glitch with a hotline the state set up to answer questions about the virus. Calls to the hotline from out-of-state numbers wouldn't go through as of Friday afternoon.

Missouri's first confirmed case of COVID-19 was a St. Louis-area woman in her 20s who had been studying in Italy and tested positive for the coronavirus last week after returning home.

The state's second case is a person in their early 20s who had recently traveled to Austria, Parson said Thursday. The patient was tested at a clinic in Springfield, is quarantined at home with mild symptoms and is expected to recover, Parson said.

Parson on Friday said the state is working out agreements to allow Washington University and the University of Missouri to conduct coronavirus tests and expand the state's testing capacity.

The World Health Organization has labelled the coronavirus a pandemic and President Donald Trump has declared a national emergency.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the WHO, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.

Kansas City Public Schools decided to close on Friday, one day before the start of spring break. Most students in the district receive free and reduced-priced lunch. Ray Weikal, a KCPS spokesman, said the district has been “planning for services like food distribution, virtual learning and deep cleaning in case we cancel school after spring break,"" The Kansas City Star reported.

“We know that our families depend on us for multiple services, and we commit to continuing to support our families in the event of future closures,” Weikal said.

The private Barstow School in Kansas City, canceled classes for Thursday and Friday ahead of a two-week spring break due to virus exposure concerns.

School officials said a family member of a school employee tested positive for COVID-19. School officials canceled classes as a precaution but said the infected person hasn't visited the campus, and the related school employee has shown no symptoms. No students or other school staff were exposed.

Spokeswoman Lisa Tulp said students and staff may be able to return March 30, or “we may have to move to online.”

Several universities in the state have moved to online classes.

Parson asked the Legislature to authorize $13 million in federal emergency funding to address the coronavirus.

Kansas City and St. Louis have banned all public events with more than 1,000 attendees. St. Patrick's Day parades in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield have been canceled. Six Flags St. Louis announced that it has suspended operation until at least the end of March.

Meanwhile, the Department of Corrections announced Thursday that Missouri’s 20 state-run prisons will be closed to visitors, with the exception of attorneys, for the next 30 days. Parson on Friday said the Department of Mental Health and Missouri veterans' homes also are restricting visitors.

St. Louis Circuit Court suspended all jury trials through April 13 and walk-in weddings at the county courthouse on Friday afternoons will be suspended on March 30 and April 3.

Entertainment venues in Kansas City and St. Louis also announced closings or cancellations for the next few weeks. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Arts in Kansas City will be closed Saturday through April 3 and the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts said it will postpone all events through April 1. Also, the St. Louis Art Museum and Contemporary Art Museum will remain open but are canceling tours, special events and lectures starting Sunday through April 30.

Churches also were calling off services, including the Church of the Resurrection, which has the largest Methodist congregation in the U.S. with over 20,000 members. The megachurch's main campus is in Leawood, Kansas, but it has campuses on the Missouri side of the line.",state_of_emergency,15544
Missouri,Pettis,43908.81736,https://ksisradio.com/pettis-county-declares-state-of-emergency/,Pettis County Declares State of Emergency,"Pettis County Commissioner David Dick, Sedalia Mayor John Kehde and Pettis County Health Center Administrator JoAnn Martin jointly issued the following statement last Wednesday afternoon:

""Dear County Residents,

We realize that the current Coronavirus pandemic is causing a great deal of anxiety and concern. concerns about school closings, job issues and where to find basic necessities is making daily life more difficult. Life as we know it has changed and will remain different for weeks to come. No one knows how long these changes will have to stay in place. We do know that the more everyone works together to stop the spread of the disease, the more quickly life will return to normal.

The leadership of the county and city and their partners are working together to implement plans that have been in place for a number of years as well as developing new plans to address the different challenges this particular virus has caused. The decision to issue an Emergency Declaration by the County was to provide clear guidance on what is expected of our community, acknowledge this is an emergency situation and open up resources to support the response of our government entities, we are trying to provide the most up to date information available, but information is changing very quickly.

The Pettis County Health Center and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services along with the CDC are the best places to look for correct, factual information. There is a lot of misinformation circulating around social media.

One major area of concern is related to testing for the Coronavirus. There has been a lot of information from the Federal government that testing will be widely available. There are more tests available than when testing began and more coming. Testing is for people who are ill with a fever of 100.4, cough, shortness of breath and a risk factor including travel to specific countries and counties or direct contact with a person who has a lab confirmed case of Coronavirus.

When drive-through testing becomes available, we will let the community know where and how to obtain the test. New testing facilities are coming on line quickly. There should be enough testing materials available by April I, please be patient — people are being tested based on symptoms, not who they are. If you feel you have symptoms, please call your doctor before going to the office. Do not go to the Emergency Room unless you are seriously ill.

If you are told that you may have been exposed to the virus and are sent home, that means you need to stay IN YOUR HOME for 14 days. This does not mean going to the store or visiting with friends. If you need help with getting groceries or medicines, reach out to friends and families who may be able to take care of those items- We are working on setting up a telephone line for community residents to call if there is no one else who can help you get what you need.

As the guidance from Governor Parson regarding public gathering is changing we are following the first guidance he outlined. However, if at all possible, groups should be limited to 10 people until the end of March. Listed below is what needs to happen

1. All events that would have more than 50 people are to be cancelled or rescheduled. This includes meetings, weddings, concerts, plays, event barns/venues, social clubs and fund raising events. We are asking businesses to work with customers who must reschedule events. Please support the important charitable organizations that had fundraisers scheduled during the next several months.

2. The Governor's direction does not include schools, child care facilities and businesses. However, restaurants and bars are considered public gathering spaces which are addressed separately. Those organizations will make closing decisions based on information from state agencies and public health officials. All of these organizations are working with public health about closures decisions.

3. Restaurants and bars need to limit the number of people in the facility to 50 or less at a time. There should be encouragement for patrons to wash their hands, for those restaurants that can, takeout and delivery should be used as much as possible. All restaurants should remove items that are touched by multiple people such as ketchup bottles, salt and pepper and other common items. Menus should be cleaned between customers. We have been asked to do this for at least the next 15 days.

When shopping, please support our local businesses if possible. Some of our local businesses have on line shopping options that will help us through this situation. Supporting our local businesses will help them to survive and be there when life returns to normal. Please do not buy more than you need, we need to have enough food and necessities for all of our community.

We all need to continue to do those things that help keep us safe — stay home if you are sick, wash your hands frequently, avoid touching your face, eyes and mouth, stay home as much as possible. Staying home is very important for those over 65 years of age, have chronic illnesses or have a decreased immune system. Please do not go to visit people in the hospital if you are sick. The hospital is closed to visitors. However, please do call and check on your family and neighbors to ensure they have what they need such as medicines and food.

This pandemic will pass we just do not know how long it will take. Everyone will need to be patient as we all learn to live with a slower pace of life. Take time to catch up with people you have been meaning to call, write a letter or send a card to brighten the day of another, talk to your family. Try to view this as the pause in a busy life not something that is impossible to live with.""",state_of_emergency,42205

The Phelps County Commission approved a State of Emergency Declaration for the county to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Phelps County.

The State of Emergency goes into effect at 12:01 a.m. on Saturday, and will be reassessed on April 2.

The Rolla Rural Fire Protection District said the commissioners approved the State of Emergency Declaration partly due to the current spread of the virus along with the first case of COVID-19 confirmed in Pulaski County.

The Pulaski County Health Center announced they received notification of the first confirmed case of a Pulaski County resident testing positive for COVID-19, on Thursday. The health center then recommended that on Friday all public and private schools remain closed for at least 14 days, and ordered all restaurants and bars to no longer offer dine-in services.

Drive-thru and carryout orders are still permitted, the health center said in a release.

The health center says the patient’s identity will remain confidential, but the case does not appear to be travel related.

The health center said they are working with the individual to make sure they are following Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) and Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. The patient is currently in isolation, the health center said.

The county health center is now working with the DHSS to conduct an investigation to identify any individuals that may have come in close contact with the patient, and will monitor them for symptoms and assist in the containment of the virus.

""It is important that every member of the community continue to follow the CDC basic hygiene preventative measures. These measures include: avoiding contact with people who are sick, covering coughs and sneezes, proper hand-washing, cleaning frequently used surfaces, and staying home when sick,"" the health center said.

The Rolla Rural Fire Protection District said they along with other emergency services in Phelps County have now changed some of their response protocols, and ask that if residents have an emergency to call 911 and tell the dispatchers if they are feeling ill or running a temperature.

Rolla Rural said individuals that come into contact with their personnel on call should tell them that same information. “Even if you do not have these symptoms, we may provide you with a surgical style mask and ask that you wear it during the time you are in contact with us,” the department said on Thursday.

Rolla Rural Fire Protection District said staff will now wear extra personal protective equipment to ensure their own safety.

As of Tuesday afternoon, there were no confirmed cases in Randolph County.

Two more COVID-19 tests have come back negative, but more testing is being done, said Randolph County Health Department Administrator Sharon Whisenand.

The commission’s action is meant to be a proactive response and as a way to obtain possible Federal Emergency Management Respond funding, said Presiding Commissioner John Truesdell.

""What we did today will go a long way to help us so that as we starting feeling the crunch of what it does to us financially,"" he said. ""We’ll be able to tap into some federal funding and maybe replenish some of the money that we’re spending.""

The decision was made Tuesday morning after the commission met with health department and other county officials.

""We don’t want anybody to panic because we did this,"" said Westren District Commissioner John Hobbs said. ""But if you’re feeling bad, you need to stay home.""

The declaration also forms a County Emergency Operations Center, which Whisenand will spearhead.

""We are wanting everything to be directed through Sharon, because she is the most involved,"" Hobbs said.

After speaking with Gov. Mike Parson, state and local health officials Tuesday afternoon, it is apparent that it is only a matter of time before a case is confirmed in Randolph County, Truesdell said.

""What I’m getting from all of the sources is that if you haven’t got a confirmed case in your county, hang around because it’s coming,"" Truesdell said.

The commission will have weekly teleconferences with Parson and officials from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, he said.

""I thought that was really worth while, because we didn’t get bogus information,"" Truesdell said.

Despite many events being canceled and organizations, businesses and government buildings closing their doors to the public, the courthouse will remain open for now, he said.

""Our goal is to keep all government services up and running,"" Truesdell said.

CHARLES COUNTY, Mo. — St. Charles County Executive Steve Ehlmann has declared an emergency in St. Charles County due to coronavirus concerns.

“I am declaring this as an emergency to better arm the county against the unknowns of this pandemic, and so that we can access potential federal funding should the need arise,"" Ehlmann said.

The St. Charles County Department of Public Health is advising the public not to attend gatherings of 250 people or more in a single indoor space. The Department Health also advised those who are especially vulnerable to COVID-19 to not attend gatherings of 10 or more people.

St. Charles County is not prohibiting any events at this time.

Montana,Lincoln,43910,https://thewesternnews.com/news/2020/mar/20/state-of-emergency-declared-in-lincoln-county-12/,State of emergency declared in Lincoln County,"March 20, 2020 8:29 AM

The Lincoln County Board of Commissioners declared a countywide state of emergency in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic during its March 18 meeting.

Coming on the heels of President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration and Gov. Steve Bullock’s proclamation of a state of emergency for Montana, the county-level resolution gives the board authority to raise two mills in response to the crisis.

Dollars raised by an emergency levy can only be spent with the unanimous decision of county commissioners, according to state code. Money raised during a crisis that goes unspent must be set aside for future emergencies.

County Commissioner Jerry Bennett (D-2), who made the motion to declare a state of emergency, said the board had no immediate plans to raise money.

“I move to approve, but just with the clear understanding that this is just a formality,” he said.

The board voted unanimously to approve the measure.

Commissioner Mark Peck (D-1) said there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county as yet, but wanted to ensure the board was getting accurate and up-to-date information from the jurisdiction’s health department. Commissioners broke from the meeting’s agenda to call health officials in for an unplanned public briefing.

“I think it would be good for them to be briefing us,” Peck said. “Our public health folks should probably be shooting us daily updates on what’s going on.”

During the briefing, Health Department Director Kathi Hooper sought permission to hire temporary staff to help with virus testing. Asked how many, Hooper and Public Health Director Jennifer McCully said at least one more person to start.

Currently, the department has a single staff member handling testing countywide. Trying to cover Eureka, Libby and Troy has left resources stretched thin, Hooper said.

“We lose her for half a day when she has to run up to Eureka for testing,” she said. “We’re hoping to hire a 90 day temp up in Eureka, [someone] who is a nurse who could respond when needed for testing.”

Instead, commissioners directed the department to hire two temporary staff members immediately. They gave Hooper and McCully permission to hire a third if necessary.

“It would not hurt to find three and hire two right away,” Peck said.

McCully and Hooper told the commissioners they already had a person in mind in Eureka. The challenge with hiring two additional staffers would be finding candidates with the necessary qualifications, McCully said.

Because of the logistical limitations on COVID-19 tests, the health department staff is continuing to meet with individuals who may have been exposed to the virus. Were tests to become available in mass quantities, officials could create a centralized site, McCully said.

In other parts of the country, like California, Massachusetts and Texas, drive through coronavirus testing facilities have sprung up.

For now, though, officials in Lincoln County want residents who suspect they may have the illness to contact the health department at 406-293-6295.

“I would like to, for as long as possible, meet people where they are at … until we are in a place to do drive through testing,” McCully said.

On the same day, officials with the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office announced the discontinuation of non-emergency business. That includes canceling jail visitations; the 24/7 alcohol-screening program and drug patches; issuing concealed weapon permits and renewals; and conducting background check fingerprints and VIN inspections. Fees incurred for late concealed weapons permit renewals as a result of the measures would be waived, officials wrote in a statement.

Detention center personnel will no longer accept money for inmates through the sheriff’s office lobby, officials said. Instead, cash, check or money orders could be sent to 512 California Avenue addressed to the inmate and the detention center.

Officials also warned that the agency will employ a “limited patrol response” for incidents where a crime has not been committed and there are no safety or security concerns.

Authorities urged residents to file reports by phone at 406-293-4112 ext. 1231.

“The Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office will continue to actively patrol our community to provide the safety and security of our citizens,” read the statement. “However, we are taking the above precautions to both limit exposure and the potential of carrying and passing COVID-19.”",state_of_emergency,19460

Meagher County Commissioners signed an emergency declaration this afternoon due to a power outage that began this morning. County residents, like those in the town of White Sulphur Springs, have been without power since around 8 a.m.

According to Rick Seidlitz, the Meagher County fire chief and disaster and emergency service coordinator, the county is working to help residents affected by the outage.

""Our biggest concern is our large elderly population, and a lot of them are on oxygen,"" he said. ""And their condensers don’t work with no power either, so they’re on regular oxygen tanks.""

Seidlitz says they are working to distribute tanks to those who may have run out.

He says the outage has affected many businesses, including gas stations which couldn’t pump fuel.

Schools also faced problems as NorthWestern Energy originally said the problem would be fixed within two hours.

“You know, at 8:00, they were trying to determine if they were going to send the kids home or keep them,"" Seidlitz said. ""The information they got was they only needed two hours. Well they could deal with that. Two hours passed and they said, 'well another two hours.' Well that gets them into lunch. And they said, ‘well it’s only going to be another two hours so we can keep them.’ Well of course they didn’t have any power for lunch.”

NorthWestern Energy spokesperson Brandy Powers says an equipment failure at the Two Dot substation led to the outage.

“You know, as we assess the line, I mean, we’re trying to provide accurate information and restoring power as soon as possible. Because this was a breaker issue, as power is restored, it doesn’t hold, so they are continuing to try and make the fix.”

Powers says crews have been working since this morning, and they hope to have power restored by 6 p.m. She says the outage impacted around 1,400 customers.",state_of_emergency,1937

""There's been a lot of talk and concern in the community,"" Commissioner Chris Hoffman said during the special session Friday morning. ""It's not within the authority of the Board of County Commissioners to close businesses or shutdown society in any shape or form.

Instead, Hoffman noted it's the job in a public health emergency ""for the county's health officer to take those steps"".

To that end, Commissioner Jeff Burrows said he was recommending that County Health Officer Carol Calderwood take over as the Incident Commander of the Incident Management Team that was formed earlier this week.

Commissioners said they appreciate the people who are taking ""positive steps"" already to combat any spread of the virus, including restaurants who have voluntarily closed their dining rooms.



Commissioner Jeff Burrows believes those measures are ""a big part of the reason"" Ravalli County hasn't seen a confirmed COVID-19 case.

""We would encourage people to remain calm"", Hoffman said, urging people to not overbuy groceries and other supplies. ""That's not the Bitterroot.""

The step comes just days after the county implemented an Incident Management Team to bring together the county and other agencies to craft a response to the growing emergency.

That was seen as a way to bring all partners together to consider solutions, but also to improve communications between agencies and the public.

As of Friday morning, Ravalli County remained one of the counties in Montana that had no positive COVID-19 cases.

“This is by far the most difficult decision I have ever made as the health officer ... This is where pandemic becomes very, very real. We’re not only talking about only economic impacts from a pandemic, we’re talking about people’s jobs, and we’re talking about businesses and their livelihoods. This is not what any of us ever hope to do. We are in a situation that is unprecedented. We need to take whatever steps we can to limit the impact of this disease,"" Yellowstone County Health Officer John Felton said at a press conference Monday.

Read the full order here.

Restaurants are allowed to sell take out food, according to the order signed by Felton.

“The restaurants will be closed to dine-in customers. However if they have takeout or delivery services, those can continue,"" Felton said.

In addition, food service establishments that serve a specific population, such as a universities or nursing homes with dining halls or cafeterias, will remain open.

The ban lasts through midnight March 23, which is next Monday.

Felton said the temporary restaurant shutdown gives health officials time to assess the COVID-19 spread in the community. It also gives health officials the time to work with restaurant operators to implement social distancing protocol in restaurant operation.

“It also gives us some time to work with those operators to begin to identify other things to help with social distancing, the idea of keeping people far enough away from each other or have less risk to the exposure of disease,"" Felton said.

Six cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Montana, including one in Yellowstone County. A seventh case involved a Montana woman who tested positive out of state in Maryland.

“We know that in the next few days we will start to receive a very large number of test results coming back. That will certainly be helpful in determining how widespread the disease is and what the extent of community spread is,"" Felton said.

Felton said local establishments will be notified of the order to close, and the decision was not made lightly.

“This was not a decision that was made easily or rapidly. We have a very close-knit public health community. There has been a lot of communication between our local health officers, the state health department, and trying to figure out the best way to go about this. Although it seems sudden because it’s here, it is not something that sort of came up in the last hour or two,"" Felton said.

The health officer order is enforceable by police, but Felton doesn't expect to run into that problem.

""In what I believe to be the extremely unlikely circumstance that someone decided they were going to operate in defiance of this order, our approach is always educational first to make sure they know what the order is and how long it will last. If someone still refused, then we would be forced to involved law enforcement to stop the operation. It is a legally enforceable order,"" Felton said.

Gymnasium and theater operators are exempt from this order because social distancing procedures can be followed at those establishments, Felton said.

“It appears that most of the gym operators have already canceled fitness classes. Which leaves free weights and machine exercises to do, which creates a sort of natural social distancing. With respect to theaters, it seems like there’s enough room in most theaters where people can spread out,"" Felton said.

Felton said community health leaders have planned for pandemics in the past, but this is the first to see this kind of response.

“This is truly an unprecedented situation in which we find ourselves. We have planned for pandemics. We thought several diseases in the past might do this: H1N1 flu, SARS, MERS. For just about everyone around today, this is the really gigantic pandemic we would have to deal with,"" Felton said.",None,154162

Nebraska,Cuming,,https://kticradio.com/regional-news/audio-cuming-county-planning-commission-approves-second-application-from-bluestem-energy-solutions-for-single-wind-turbine-facility/,(AUDIO) Cuming County Planning Commission approves second application from Bluestem Energy Solutions for Single Wind Turbine Facility,"The Cuming County Planning Commission approved Bluestem Energy Solution’s reapplication for a conditional use permit for a single wind turbine facility to be built in Cuming County by a 5-2 vote at Monday night’s meeting. The Cuming County Board of Supervisors unanimously denied the first application on June 25th due in large part to no clarity on the decommissioning plan and no mitigation on the RTK. That’s according to Zoning Administrator Becky Lerch, who explains why the Planning Commission approved Bluestem Energy Solution’s application for a second time.

This will go in front of the Cuming County Board of Supervisors again on July 30th at 11:00 a.m, at the Nielsen Center due to court that day and the DMV being at the courthouse, according to Lerch.

The site address is proposed to be located three miles Northeast of Wisner to the Northeast of Road T and Road 9 Intersection in the Intensive Ag District.

Matt Robinette with Bluestem Energy Solutions says the cost of the project is about $5 million.

The second application was received on June 27th.

Attorney Logan Hoyt, who represents J.R. Breitkreutz, says there are three issues with interference with RTK GPS.

Hoyt says Multipath is when a single bounces off an object such as a tower or large building it affects the accuracy of GPS cause when the GPS receiver reads that signal it shows a slightly different position.

He adds the initial report indicated the rover should not be operated within 5,550 feet of the wind turbine, and said the addendum indicated that not withstanding whatever was put in there, there are no issues due to a lot of satellites that provide strong signals and the rover should be able to read those signals.

Hoyt says the issue is the signals can still be strong and bounce off and be inaccurate.

Lerch says she spoke with four John Deere Representatives in Nebraska and Iowa who say they have not seen any problems with running the RTK system near wind turbines. Robinette says they talked to 40 counties across Nebraska, Iowa, and Kansas that currently operate wind turbines, and none reported issues with their local GPS equipment operating close to the turbines.

Cuming County Public Power District General Manager Chet McWhorter says not more than one wind turbine is needed in the county.

McWhorter says why the board went ahead and went with the project had to do with the ability to hedge against future rate increases, to have a little bit of local control on some energy issues, and to provide economic growth and development in the county.

Lerch says the turbine would come down and be removed to at least 4 feet below ground level if it can’t be redone after its lifetime.

7:50 a.m.

Nebraska officials are asking dozens of people who attended a Special Olympics basketball tournament last week in Fremont to self-quarantine after learning a woman infected with COVID-19 also attended the event.

The woman spent most of the day Feb. 29 at the Fremont Family YMCA, where the tournament was held, according to a news release Saturday from the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

Health officials have urged the tournament's players, coaches and team staff members to self-quarantine and monitor themselves until March 14 for symptoms of the virus, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. They're also asked to self-report to the Nebraska public health online system or call their local health departments for next steps.

About 500 people attended the event from Fremont, Omaha, Lincoln and other areas in eastern Nebraska, officials said. Spectators and other people who were in the YMCA building that same day are at much lower risk than the direct participants of the tournament.

Several institutions in Fremont, including Fremont Public Schools, Archbishop Bergan Catholic Schools, Trinity Lutheran School, Midland University and the YMCA, canceled or postponed all activities effective immediately.

7:40 a.m.

The District of Columbia says it has recorded its first case of coronavirus.

In a tweet, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser says testing at the public health lab of the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences on Saturday yielded its first presumptive positive coronavirus case. The mayor scheduled a Saturday evening news conference.

The D.C. case comes as New Jersey reports a person with coronavirus had attended last week’s Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, a suburb of Washington.

Spain has deployed police in a northern town to help enforce a home quarantine placed on a neighborhood with a high number of residents infected by the coronavirus.

The regional government of La Rioja said Saturday that the extra measures have been taken to contain the outbreak in Haro, a town of 11,000 residents, where the majority of the 39 cases in the region are located.

Regional authorities warn that breaking the quarantine is punishable by fines of 3,000-600,000 euros ($3,380-$677,000).

Fernando Simón, the director of Spain’s center of health emergencies and alerts, confirmed reports that medical experts suspect that a recent funeral led to the outbreak in Spain’s north. Besides the around 30 people infected in Haro, authorities suspect that some of the 70 infected in the neighboring Basque Country region are also linked to the funeral held in the Basque city of Vitoria.

The virus has caused eight deaths in Spain and infected over 400. Thirty people have recovered from the virus.

Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty said officials were working to find out who the man had come into contact with.

Pope Francis will deliver his next two public blessings via video to prevent crowds from gathering as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus.

The Vatican said in a statement Saturday that the pope will not hold his traditional Sunday noon blessing from a window over St. Peter’s Square, as is tradition, but that it will be streamed from the library in the Apostolic Palace. The Wednesday audience will be handled in the same way.

Francis has also stopped celebrating morning Mass before invited guests at the chapel in the Vatican hotel where he lives, indicating his contact has been extremely limited in an apparent effort to prevent his infection.

At 83, recovering from a cold and with part of one lung removed from a respiratory infection when he was a young man, Francis would be at risk of serious complications if he were to catch the virus. Italy has recommended that elderly people remain at home.

The measures come after the Vatican confirmed its first case of the virus on Friday.

The pope appeared from a window high above St. Peter’s Square for last Sunday’s blessing, pausing twice for short bouts of coughing. He similarly was seen coughing and blowing his nose during Ash Wednesday Mass just days earlier.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging older adults and people with severe medical conditions such as heart, lung or kidney disease to ""stay home as much as possible"" and avoid crowds to avoid contracting the coronavirus.

The CDC updated the guidance on its COVID-19 website on Friday. The agency said older people are more likely to have serious illness and that underlying health conditions make it harder for people to fight off the illness.

The agency also suggested older adults and people with severe conditions should stay away from those who are sick and wash their hands often when they do go out. It also suggested such people have several weeks of medications and supplies at home.

For most people, the flu-like viral illness causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

The military says the sailor is “currently restricted to their residence, receiving supportive and medical care in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention host nation guidelines.”

An investigation is underway to determine whether any other personnel may have been exposed, and those already identified as having been in close contact have been notified and isolated at their residences.

At least three government prefects — in Bergamo, Brescia and Matera — have tested positive for the virus, along with three Milan prosecutors, according to media reports.

The government in its latest measures put the courts on a two-week holiday footing from Monday to allow them to better reorganize cases as the virus continues to spread throughout Italy.

Malaysia has turned away a cruise ship carrying around 2,000 passengers and crew from a port in northern Penang state, becoming the second country to bar the ship from docking after Thailand.

The Costa Fortuna was turned away from the popular resort island of Phuket in southern Thailand on Friday due to the presence of 64 Italians on board. Thai health authorities have officially designated Italy a dangerous communicable disease area because it has been hit hard by the coronavirus.

Phee Boon Poh, a Penang executive councilor, said he was informed by the Penang port that it had turned away the cruise liner Saturday morning following a directive from the transport ministry. He said the ship was now making its way to Singapore.

Novel Coronavirus - COVID-19 (AP)

Nye County has declared a local emergency in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

On Wednesday night, the county said it had confirmed its first case of COVID-19 in a Beatty resident.

On Thursday morning, the county issued a news release saying a “declaration of existence of local emergency” was issued by county leaders, including county manager Tim Sutton, County Commission Chair John Koenig, director of Emergency Management Scott Lewis and Sheriff Sharon Wehrly. The declaration reads:

“In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to better protect the citizens of Nye County, I am issuing the attached Emergency Declaration,” Sutton said in a statement. “This is being done in an abundance of caution and is similar to the declaration issued during the recent Storm Area 51 event. The Board of County Commissioners is unable to meet at this time due to restrictions on public gatherings but the board will have the opportunity to review and ratify this declaration at a future meeting.

“Several other Nevada counties have taken this precautionary step, which allows for quicker response in times of emergencies. The declaration is also necessary to qualify for state and federal grant funding so we can hopefully offset some of the costs associated with fighting, treating, and containing the virus. Thank you all for your patience during this challenging time, and please know that we are doing all we can to reopen our offices and provide full county services.”

The first Nye County resident to have a confirmed positive test for COVID-19 was described in a county Facebook post as a male patient is in his 60s who lives in Beatty, where he is self-quarantined at home.

“Emergency Services has made contact and is continuing to investigate the source of the infection and retracing his movements for the past few weeks,” the post said.

As a result, all nonessential employees and personnel in the county have been asked to work from home beginning Tuesday, officials said.

Government operations are reduced to only essential functions through March 31. All essential employees, such as law enforcement, corrections, public safety, and others as dictated will report to work as usual. Non-essential employees will not report to work but will remain on call to work remotely as needed.

""The declaration is being utilized to protect the public health and ensure personnel can be home to care for their families during this unprecedented time,"" Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli, Jr. said. ""This was not an easy decision to reach, however, our priority is to make judicious decisions that will benefit us all, flatten the curve, and reduce the spread of this virus. We will be constantly reevaluating our operations to ensure that we can provide these services while continuing to protect our employees and our residents.""



Officials are also asking all non-essential businesses in the county to consider voluntarily closing or modifying operations to comply with CDC social distancing recommendations.



""We acknowledge that this request is a tough pill to swallow, and we absolutely do not take that reality lightly, however sacrifices made today are necessary if we are to save lives tomorrow,"" Cappelli said. ""The science is clear — the more we restrict social interaction, the slower the spread of infection becomes, and the fewer lives ultimately lost. This has become a life or death situation and the time to act is now.""



The announcement came around the same time it was revealed that a third person in Camden County had tested positive for new coronavirus.

A woman in her 50s is currently in self-isolation in her Haddon Township home, officials said on Monday. She is maintaining frequent contact with the Camden County Health Department. Officials believe her initial contact came from an exposure at Newark International Airport. After that, they believe she has only been in contact with one other person, a friend, in addition to her family. Read more here: First Positive Case Of Coronavirus Identified In Haddon Township

The New Jersey Department of Health has partnered with the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System to open and operate a call center (1-800-222-1222) for public use regarding questions, concerns, and other information related to coronavirus spread in New Jersey. More information is also available on the state's coronavirus webpage.

Hunterdon County Freeholder Board Director Shaun Van Doren has directed the County’s Office of Emergency Management (OEM) to give the highest status to the County’s request for 5000 COVID-19 test kits to NJ OEM, in support of Hunterdon County health care providers’ request for test kits.

Van Doren stated, “On behalf of the Freeholder Board, I have directed the County’s OEM to submit a Resource Request to NJ OEM for an immediate supply of 5000 test kits. Hunterdon Healthcare and other medical providers need additional test kits to support testing. I am advised that the state should forward the request to FEMA if they cannot fulfill it.”

Van Doren noted, “Health and medical personnel who administer tests also need protective clothing and equipment to administer the COVID-19 tests.

Hunterdon County’s OEM and Health Department, since February, have already provided more than 70,100 protective items to first responders and healthcare workers, having received nearly 165 individual requests. More personal protective equipment (PPE) is needed.

On March 16th OEM and Health requested 67,500 additional units of PPE’s including masks, gowns, and gloves, from the state OEM, to provide those resources for Hunterdon medical providers. This request should also have been sent by the state to FEMA.”

“Health professionals advise that for any mass testing regime to be implemented, fulfillment of these requests is necessary,” Van Doren said.

The County’s Health Department, OEM, Medical Reserve Corps (MRC), and CERT teams will be providing personnel to assist with expanded testing. MRC volunteers have been supporting the Hunterdon Healthcare COVID call center daily for two weeks. The COVID hotline number is 908 788-6440.

“We will continue to press state and federal agencies and officials to ensure that needed resources are provided to Hunterdon County to assist our local medical providers and our residents,” Van Doren concluded.

This declaration will enable the county’s Office of Emergency Management -- with the concurrence of the Hunterdon County Health Office -- to request assistance from New Jersey and the Federal government. This assistance encompasses the providing of material resources from the Strategic National Stockpile that can support the Hunterdon Medical Center as well as other county health care facilities, according to a press release.

“Officials within the county have been hard at work addressing the public health emergency posed by coronavirus,"" Freeholder Director Shaun Van Doren said in the release. “The Hunterdon County Health Department and Office of Emergency Management have been working around the clock to plan and respond to the constantly evolving challenges posed by coronavirus.”

The decision comes the same day Gov. Phil Murphy announced further measures to try and slow the spread of the virus.

In signing this declaration of a state of emergency on Monday, Van Doren also announced that the county offices will remain open despite the closing and suspension of other operations or events.

In addition to the county libraries, set to close Tuesday at 5 p.m., access to the county Senior Center is suspended through to April 6. On that day, the suspension will be re-evaluated.

All senior activities, including congregate meals, are suspended, though Meals on Wheels of Hunterdon County will continue to drop off meals to its patrons using a method that eliminates personal interaction between participants and volunteers.

The Division of Parks & Recreation is temporarily suspending programs and closing visitor centers to the public, though parks trails will remain open. The division’s staff will refund those affected by the suspension, and continue to be available via email and telephone for public inquiries and reservations.

This suspension will be reevaluated on March 31. The parks staff are currently exploring options to offer educational resources online through its website and Facebook page.

The Board of Elections office will be closed to the public, but staff will continue to administer election procedures at a table in the lobby, where the public can come in and fill out any forms that they need and leave them in the lock box for processing.

The Searching the Search Room event scheduled for Saturday has been cancelled, as has the HackHunterdon Monthly Tech Meetup scheduled for March 26.

The county’s electronics waste cleanup scheduled for Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. has not been cancelled or postponed, though the county is encouraging participants to remain in their vehicles when dropping off material. All electronic waste should be placed in the trunk, cargo area or truck beds of the vehicles so they are easily accessible to the staff removing it.

The county Health Department will continue to provide essential services to residents and businesses but encourages the electronic transfer of documents and the conducting of business over the phone when possible. A drop-off process has been instituted outside of the Health Department’s office if residents cannot be serviced over the phone.

County residents interested in applying for SNAP food assistance or cash assistance under the Work First New Jersey program are encouraged by the Department of Human Services to to visit NJHelps.org. Social Services can conduct interviews by phone, and residents are encouraged to call Social Services at 908-788-1300 if they have an emergency housing need.

The Greater Raritan One-Stop Career Training Service Centers in Flemington and Somerville are closed to in-person visits, and staff will continue to assist customers over the phone and via email. Customers are encouraged to call 908-541-5780 or email onestop@co.somerset.nj.us for assistance.

According to Van Doren, these closures and readjustments will all be “reevaluated on an ongoing basis” in consultation with both the county Department of Health and in accordance with CDC guidelines.

“As conditions on the ground change and the risk of coronavirus subsides, the county will aim to scale back these policies,” Van Doren said. ""We must remember that as Americans we are in this fight together, and by taking these measures now we will help to mitigate against additional exposures and serious health outcomes.”

On Thursday, March 12, Mercer County Executive Brian Hughes issued an executive order announcing a county-wide state of emergency to aid the fight against COVID-19.

The announcement follows New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy’s proclamation of a state of emergency Monday night.

Executive Order 2020-01 declared that Mercer County agencies are “authorized to take appropriate action to assist municipal governments in containing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from this COVID-19 outbreak.”

Mercer County will be following infectious disease guidelines and protocol as given by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The County Health Officer can alter sanitary and health codes to combat the disease. County employees are banned from out-of-state business-related travel.

All public gatherings of more than 250 people have been canceled. McCarter Theater has also suspended all performances, classes, and events through March 31 to abide by this guideline.

""We understand that our residents are concerned about this rapidly evolving situation, and we're determined to take whatever steps are necessary to minimize the risks for the people of Mercer County,"" Hughes said.

The executive order also allows Mercer County to seek reimbursement from the federal government for measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

While no Mercer County residents have been diagnosed with COVID-19, one Burlington County resident who works in Robbinsville Township is the first presumed positive case to be associated with Mercer County.

In Mercer County, Sheriff Jack Kemler announced improvements to a mobile device app to provide regional information.

Residents with questions or concerns about COVID-19 and resources available to them can call 2-1-1. NJ 211 is New Jersey's statewide, comprehensive, information and referral service operated by United Ways of New Jersey. New Jersey residents call also text NJCOVID to 898-211 to receive text information and stay informed and can text their zip code to 898-211 for live text assistance.



According to the Governor's Office, these enhancements to 211 will supplement, rather than replace, the existing COVID-19 hotline, operated by the New Jersey Poison Control Center. State residents with questions about COVID-19 illness can continue to call the previously shared numbers for the COVID-19 hotline.

Resolution could qualify Luna County for state and federal emergency funding

DEMING – Luna County Commissioners voted unanimously to approve County Resolution 20-25, declaring a county-wide state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic that is gripping the nation. The resolution was adopted at noon on Monday during a special meeting of the Luna County Board of Commissioners.

As of Sunday evening, the New Mexico Department of Health has confirmed 65 positive cases in the state, including four cases in nearby Dona Ana County. This comes from https://cv.nmhealth.org/ where reports indicate 5,386 COVID-19 tests have been performed and 5,321 have come back negative.

“Definitely respect the social distancing at this time and limit travel only for essential needs,” said Luna County Manager Chris Brice. “The virus itself is not that dangerous to the majority of the population, but if we get enough people who are infected then out hospitals get overrun and the physical capacity to isolate a great number of people becomes a problem.”

The county-wide state of emergency is a necessary resolution to allow Luna County government to apply for state and federal relief funds during this global crisis. “COVID-19 is certainly something we have to guard against, but the economic impact of this is also a concern,"" Brice said.

Brice also noted $50,000 has been put on a separate line item to handle immediate expenditures the county must track. Luna County's Starmax Family Entertainment Center and the Mimbres Valley Special Events Center have been shut down and are directly impacted by the state mandates.

The migrant relief crisis in Luna County of 2019 was a valuable lesson to county government. The county is still seeking reimbursement for the expenditures during the 31,000 Central American migrants who purged through Luna County seeking asylum.

“Essentially our chain of command has been established through emergency management and we are more familiar with the operations,” Brice explained in terms of preparation for this event. “We are better prepared.”

District 2 Commissioner Linda Smrkovsky told the Headlight the resolution needed to be put forth to follow the state and federal guidelines and to ensure the safety of the citizens of Luna County. “We need to be cautious at this time, and this measure will help us in the long run.”

The meeting was attended by a few county employees and a handful of citizens, as county officials recommended the public stay at home. Seating arrangements distanced the audience six feet apart during the meeting.

“This is costing the county money in different areas,” said District 3 Commissioner John Sweetser. “If there is money available from state or federal, this resolution puts us in line for that.”

Brice reminded citizens to support local businesses through the state mandated health order. “Order take-out service at our local restaurants. Buy gift cards from businesses. They need your support now while our economy is hurting.”

The Otero County Commission granted County Manager Pamela Heltner authority to approve of administrative leave on a case-by-case basis to county employees who could not find childcare after local public schools were ordered closed as a precaution against COVID-19.

""We heard yesterday that the governor is closing the schools for three weeks, which is going to create a burden on our employees that have school-age children,"" Heltner said.

Some county departments were already predicting extended employee absences, as childcare facilities began announcing temporary closures alongside the public schools.

Even as staff at Otero County were directed to find options by contacting local churches and area organizations, the Otero County Boys & Girls Club announced Friday it would close its main club to its members. Normal services would continue to be provided only to Sierra site members, the Club's Facebook page read.

And local department worried about staffing shortages and its impact on operations.

Otero County Detention Center (OCDC) said it would be in need of additional hands given the recent events.

District 2 Otero County Commissioner Couy Griffin suggested activation of the the New Mexico National Guard to help the OCDC with relief workers.

Otero County staff said it would contact the national Guard and Border Patrol for more information about the possibility of assistance at the OCDC.

New Mexico,Sandoval,43910,https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2020/03/20/citing-covid-19-sandoval-county-attorney-seeks-court-order-to-release-non-violent-inmates/,"Citing COVID-19, Sandoval County attorney seeks court order to release non-violent inmates","Commissioners for New Mexico’s fourth largest county on Thursday asked a judge to release non-violent jail inmates “during the State of Emergency caused by the COVID-19 virus,” New Mexico In Depth has learned.

Sandoval County Attorney Robin Hammer on Thursday filed a three-page petition for writ of mandamus — a fast-tracking procedure used in exceptional circumstances — asking the District Court to blunt the “serious health risk” of the new coronavirus to those inside the jail by releasing people immediately.

Hammer’s petition also asks the court to prohibit future bookings of anyone else charged with a misdemeanor or non-violent felony into the detention center until Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham lifts her State of Emergency declaration.

The petition is set to be heard Tuesday by Chief District Judge George Eichwald.

The move marks the first time a voice from outside New Mexico’s criminal defense community has called for releasing inmates amid the growing COVID-19 crisis. Hammer has a different client. She represents Sandoval County leadership, including the jail itself, not people locked up in the jail.

Over the weekend, Bennet Baur, the state’s chief public defender, made a similar request in a letter to the state Supreme Court. He also cited the potential health risks should the virus find its way into a jail. And days later, the New Mexico Criminal Defense Lawyers Association asked the state’s highest court to identify “vulnerable populations” who could be released from jails.

Reached by telephone Thursday evening, Hammer, a longtime prosecutor and former lead investigator for the now-revamped Albuquerque Police Oversight Commission, declined to comment “beyond what is in the writ.”

The document says Sandoval County housed 204 inmates as of Thursday, and no one had, as of that date, tested positive for COVID-19. About 100 staff watch over the jail.

Adhering to instructions from Lujan Grisham’s administration to stop the spread of the virus by social distancing — staying at least six feet away from other people — is difficult, if not impossible in a jail, Hammer wrote.

A jail’s close-quarters confinement creates health risks during a public health pandemic — one that outweighs “the lower level of risk to the public posed by persons accused of misdemeanor or non-violent felony crimes” or even some people being held in the jail post-conviction, her petition says.

Attached to the petition is an affidavit sworn out by the health service administrator for the medical company that operates in the jail under contract with Sandoval County. The administrator said “it is to the benefit of both staff members and detainees to limit the contact between individuals during this health emergency.”

The petition was sent to Baur and to 13th Judicial District Attorney Lemuel Martinez.

Martinez did not return messages seeking comment.

In an interview, Baur commended Hammer and the county, calling the petition a “strong measure in the middle of a health emergency.”

“We appreciate Sandoval County stepping up on behalf of the health of people in its facility,” he said. “Just thinking about what could happen: Someone arrested can bring the virus into the facility, and someone could get it inside and bring it out. Here we have, not just an advocate for incarcerated people, but a custodian of people in custody sounding the alarm. This is an important petition.”

Erie County Executive Mark Polonzarz has issued a State of Emergency as of noon on Sunday.

All Schools in Erie County will be closed on Monday. Teachers and Staff are still to report. Further discussions will be held on Monday to decide on further closures.

Poloncarz also gave some details on who is infected:



A female in her 30's, who traveled out of state tested positive for coronavirus. She is currently in quarantine at a private residence.

A male in his 30's who recently traveled to Westchester County, one of NY's hot spots, tested positive for coronavirus. He is currently in quarantine at a private residence.

A female in her 20's who recently traveled to Italy tested positive for coronavirus. She is currently in quarantine at a private residence.

None of the three were hospitalized. We know three of people are located in Buffalo, Grand Island and Clarence and have no connection to each other.

The county tested 36 total cases on Saturday. Thirty three of those cases were negative. There are currently 59 people in Erie County in quarantine. 58 of those cases are voluntary. One of those cases is involuntary.

151 people have completed quarantine. Health officials says these numbers will change daily.

Erie County residents can call 716-858-2929 with COVID-19 questions.

Poloncarz says he will ask the legislature for $5 million to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. However, Erie County Legislator Joseph Lorigo says he needs more information on what the money will be used fore.

As of Sunday, there were 729 cases confirmed across New York.

Three New Yorkers have also died from the virus - all had other underlying health conditions.

The virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness.

Schools in Orleans and Genesee counties have already closed. Buffalo Public Schools officials say the plan is still to schools closed to students on Monday, with teachers reporting. They say the plan could change following the press conference.

Health officials encourage people to practice social distancing, keep you work areas clean, wash our hands thoroughly.

If you're sick, you're asked to stay home, call your doctor first.

If kids are sick, do not send them to school, call their doctor.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with your arm, not your hand.

Do not touch your mouth, nose and eyes.

Coronavirus symptoms

The symptoms of coronavirus can be similar to the flu or a bad cold. Symptoms include a fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control.

Most healthy people will have mild symptoms. A study of more than 72,000 patients by the Centers for Disease Control in China showed 80 percent of the cases there were mild.

But infections can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death, according to the World Health Organization. Older people with underlying health conditions are most at risk.

The CDC believes symptoms may appear anywhere from two to 14 days after being exposed.

Human coronaviruses are usually spread through...

The air by coughing or sneezing

Close personal contact, such as touching or shaking hands

Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands.

Help stop the spread of coronavirus

Stay home when you are sick.

Eat and sleep separately from your family members

Use different utensils and dishes

Cover your cough or sneeze with your arm, hot your hand.

If you use a tissue, throw it in the trash.

Lower your risk

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

If you are 60 or over and have an underlying health condition such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes or respiratory illnesses like asthma or COPD, the World Health Organization advises you to try to avoid crowds or places where you might interact with people who are sick.

BATAVIA — Genesee County is under a state of emergency due to coronavirus (COVID-19), county Legislature Chair Rochelle Stein said tonight.

“Over the past week, COVID-19 has evolved rapidly. While Genesee County has no confirmed cases, there are confirmed cases in neighboring counties and increased local testing. I believe it is inevitable we will see

cases here in Genesee County,” said Stein. “With this in mind and after discussion with Paul Pettit, director of the Genesee and Orleans County health departments, I am declaring a state of emergency for Genesee County. This declaration allows us to procure goods and services as well as required and availableassistance to municipalities and school districts. I am recommending that allschools in Genesee County close to students effective immediately for anundetermined amount of time.”

Pettit said, “We want to remind people the risk in our community still remains relatively low and these decisions are based on the need to slow transmission in our communities. Through ongoing discussions with all 10 school districts and county administration, this unified decision is based on the increased activity in our county and has led to these preventive measures.”

Kevin MacDonald, district superintendent of the Genesee Valley Educational Partnership, said in a statement, “in collaboration with the New York State and local departments of health, the component districts of the Genesee Valley Educational Partnership will be closed to students effective Monday, March 16, until further notice. Component districts will be sharing messages to their respective communities regarding details of their closures. We ask all our community members to take care of each other as we navigate this public health matter.”",state_of_emergency,59454

Legislature Chairman Vincent Bono said in a statement Saturday evening that residents are asked to heed all federal, state and local protocols and recommendations to “ensure that you and your family are protected from this threat.”

“We are in constant contact with state officials and are working with them to provide vital assistance to the community. Avoid crowded areas and maintain clean practices,” Bono said in the statement.

The declaration signed by Bono stated the coronavirus outbreak has become a public health emergency of international concern and threatens the health and welfare of the citizens of Herkimer County.

The declaration gives Bono the authority to preserve public safety and render all required and available assistance vital to the security, well-being and health of the citizens of Herkimer County.

“I hereby direct all departments and agencies of Herkimer County to take whatever steps necessary to protect life and property, public infrastructure and provide such emergency assistance deemed necessary,” the declaration signed by Bono stated.

Bono also said Saturday that the Herkimer County resident who tested positive for coronavirus last week has been released from the hospital and is recovering at home.

It was announced Friday that all public schools within the county will be closed to students effective March 16. Classes will resume April 14.

Bono said Saturday all county departments will remain open until further notice.

Have questions about the new coronavirus? Here are some answers:

What are the symptoms of coronavirus?

The Centers for Control and Prevention say that fever, cough and shortness of breath often appear two to 14 days after exposure to the coronavirus. Emergency warning signs include difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse and bluish lips or face. This and other concerning symptoms should be reported to a doctor immediately, according to the CDC.

I think I have coronavirus. What should I do?

Call ahead before you visit a doctor and alert your local health department, according to the CDC. For example, the Slocum-Dickson Medical Group in New Hartford recently had to advise they are not a testing facility.

If you are sick with the coronavirus or suspect you are, the CDC recommends you stay home and separate yourself from other people and pets in your home. If it is confirmed you have the virus, you should remain home until transmission risk is low.

Take other precautions like wearing a face mask, washing your hands often and disinfecting surfaces.

So, who do I call to get tested?

Call your health care provider, says Oneida County Health Director Phyllis D. Ellis. Your doctor can discuss with you further about your specific case and they can arrange where and when you’ll get tested.

How does the test work?

Similar to getting tested for the flu, you are swabbed and that swab is delivered to a lab, says Ellis. The results vary, but it could take up to a couple of days, she says, and in the meantime, stay quarantined.

How does the virus spread?

The CDC reports that COVID-19, or the new coronavirus, appears to be spreading easily in affected areas. The virus mainly spreads person-to-person, such as by inhaling droplets from when a sick person coughs or sneezes, according to the CDC. It is also thought that someone could touch an object that has the virus on it, and then by touching their mouth, nose or eyes become infected. It is thought that the disease mainly spreads from those showing symptoms but has been reported to spread from those not showing symptoms.

There are confirmed cases of coronavirus in my area, how do I prevent the disease from spreading to me?

The CDC says the best way to prevent exposure is by washing your hands for at least 20 seconds with soap and water — and do it often, especially after being out in public, coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose. If you can’t wash your hands, use hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.

The CDC says you should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with sick people, or the general public if the disease is spreading in your community.

You do not need to wear a face mask unless you are caring for someone who is sick and is not able to wear one, according to the CDC. Face masks may be in short supply and they should be saved for caregivers.

What risks do I have if I get coronavirus?

Those who are at a higher risk of getting sick from the disease include older adults and those with conditions like heart or lung disease and diabetes, according to the CDC. If that is the case, you must take extra caution. Stock up on supplies, keep 6 feet away from others, stay home as much as possible and avoid travel by air and cruise.

I’m pregnant and/or have children. What are the risks there?

There is no evidence that children are more susceptible to coronavirus, and most cases in China occurred in adults, according to the CDC. But infections in children have been reported, including in very young children.

Pregnancy can increase a risk for infection, but it is not yet known if this means a higher risk for coronavirus, the CDC says. It is not yet known if coronavirus can cause complications in pregnancy or be passed on to the baby, but in the small number of infants born to mother with coronavirus, none tested positive for the disease and the virus was not found in amniotic fluid or breast milk.

Anything else I should be doing to prepare?

The CDC recommends making sure you have enough household items, groceries and medication at home in case you have to self-quarantine. This includes asking your doctor or pharmacist about obtaining extra medication or using a mail-order prescription. Consider ways you can have food delivered to you either through a service or people you know.

Does this mean cutting myself off from everyone?

No. The CDC suggests keeping in touch with friends, family or community members for help. If you are caregiver, or have a caregiver, determine who takes care of them if they get sick, for example.

New York,Jefferson,43913,https://www.alreporter.com/2020/03/23/jefferson-county-orders-more-businesses-closed-amid-covid-19-crisis/,Jefferson County orders more businesses closed amid COVID-19 crisis,"It has been less than two weeks since Alabama reported its first positive case of the new novel coronavirus. Since then, the number has jumped to 242 positive cases. There are sure to be more.

Several hospitals across the state, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health, are already nearing their capacity. At any point in time, about 90 percent of the Birmingham area’s 7,000 hospital beds are in use. Elective procedures are being canceled to make room for COVID-19 patients. About a fifth of those who acquire the virus require hospitalization.

Elective procedures can be canceled to free up hospital beds. New beds can be added to rooms to increase capacity. Old hospitals can be retrofitted if needed to increase the state’s capacity to handle the surge — no, the “tsunami” — of cases public health officials expect is coming. These things are already being done. They can be done relatively easily.

But the most worrisome aspect of this COVID-19 pandemic is the fact that some 5 percent of those infected experience some form of respiratory failure. They will need intensive care and treatment with a ventilator. This phenomenon has already reached Alabama. UAB said Tuesday that their patient load of those with COVID-19 is already increasing exponentially.

At least 45 people are currently hospitalized at UAB Medical Center in Birmingham. Dozens more are under observation, and at least 18 of the 45—some 40 percent—are on ventilators. The number of hospitalized patients at UAB increased from 17 on Monday to 45 on Tuesday, according to the hospital.

For now, the hospital can handle the load. UAB is the state’s largest and most advanced hospital. It has a deep bench of some of the best doctors and nurses in the world. But even UAB is developing contingency plans. “It is impossible to say if the current rate of hospitalization will remain the same, increase or drop,” UAB Medicine spokesman Bob Shepard said. “We are developing plans to handle a surge of patients.”

But other hospitals in the state are not as well-sourced, not as well-staffed, and in much more dire financial straits. Since 2000, more than 15 hospitals have closed across the state. The most recent was near my hometown in Pickens County. There are far more hospitals in the state operating in the red than hospitals in good financial position, according to the Alabama Hospital Association.

That leaves these health systems and small rural hospitals without the resources to acquire the beds and the number of ventilators they will need to care for the surge of patients experts expect to come in the next few weeks. Many of these hospitals do not have intensive care units at all. If they do, they are small.

The state’s hospitals have about 1,344 ventilators on hand, according to the Alabama Hospital Association. On any given day, about 550 are in use on average. That means the state has a surge capacity of only 800 ventilators. These numbers should scare everyone in the state.

I recently wrote about estimates from the Harvard Global Health Institute that suggest, even in the best-case scenario in which 20 percent of adults are infected in Alabama, some 34,370 people would need ICU care. We must take drastic measures to prepare for this surge now. The science, the experts, the data, the real-life experiences of Italy, New York and Louisiana tell us this is coming.

“We are not California,” Gov. Kay Ivey said on a conference call Tuesday. “We are not New York. We aren’t even Louisiana.”

No, we are not, but we could be soon.

Gov. Ivey and the Alabama Department of Public Health have taken this crisis more seriously than many would have anticipated. They have moved swiftly since the first cases were reported less than two weeks ago. They’ve placed harsh, but necessary, restrictions on restaurants and bars. They’ve closed beaches. They’re trying to get testing to everyone in the state. They’ve instituted social-distancing guidelines. They’re allowing out-of-state hospitals to come work in Alabama.

But more must be done.

By the time this crisis is gone, some 158,906 people could need to be hospitalized in the state, according to the Harvard Global Health Institute’s most conservative estimates. Of course, all of those hospitalizations won’t be at once, but if cases surge more quickly than we hope, if we do not take social distancing seriously, if we loosen the lockdowns, hospitals could be overwhelmed and would need to ration care.

Rationing hospital beds can be managed. Field hospitals can be opened. Beds can be placed in hospital hallways. Patients can double up in the same room, or even more.

But ventilators… Ventilators cannot effectively be rationed without people dying. If someone needs to be intubated, they must be intubated. Only so much can be done to conserve these life-saving machines.

If you want are dire look at how this would play out, just look at the state’s disaster response plans. If we begin to run out of ventilators, older people, people with disabilities, and those with chronic conditions could be taken off ventilator support so someone else who is more likely to live (read: younger people) can have it. We do not want that to happen. It should not have to happen.

On the same conference call Tuesday, Dr. Scott Harris from the Alabama Department of Public Health said the state has been planning for the possibility of a surge that affects the state’s hospitals. “We’ve seen what’s happened in other parts of the world and the country, particularly in larger cities,” he said. “And we know that over the course of two or three weeks a situation can look a lot different than it does now.”

Harris said the state has a group “working hard trying to find resources like tests and trying to find ventilators” within the state and without. “We continue to do that just with the understanding that we’re also competing against many other states who are trying to do the same thing,” he said.

The Alabama Department of Public Health has an up-to-date database of hospitals’ stocks of ventilators and their availability. Harris and Ivey said the state is trying to pursue public-private partnerships to get new machines. “I’ve been notified that there are several companies in Alabama that want to be as helpful to our state as possible,” the governor said. “And keep that in mind folks, to completely change your model of business cannot happen overnight for big products like ventilators. That’s why we’re relying on public and private partnerships to fulfill our needs.”

The reality, though, is that every other state in the United States—all 50 plus D.C. and Puerto Rico—are trying to get ventilators, too. Dozens of other countries across the globe are trying to get ventilators. New York alone says it is trying to procure 30,000. Does Alabama even know how many we will need?

The federal government, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has offered to supply New York with 400. You read that right. 400 out of the 15,000 it requested. “You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?” Cuomo said Tuesday. Vice President Mike Pence later Tuesday said he would ship 2,000 from the national stockpile.

But there are likely not enough ventilators in the national stockpile.

This is not just an issue in Alabama. This is an issue across the country and the globe. Companies are not producing ventilators fast enough. New York needs the ventilators this week, Cuomo said, or sooner. The state cannot wait. Alabama and other states may not be far behind.

So what’s the plan?

The plan now seems to be to hope that private companies will decide to make more ventilators. To hope that hospitals and states can find them themselves. The president has, so far, refused to invoke the Defense Production Act to order companies to make ventilators. (Though he did say Tuesday that he would use it to procure test kits.) The state of Alabama should put pressure on the president. We need ventilators. It is a matter of safety and security.

The plan now seems to be to wait and see, which could prove disastrous. We will wait to see what the federal government will do. We will follow their lead. But the pandemic snuck up on other states like New York and Louisiana, states that are now opening makeshift hospitals in convention centers and hooking up two patients to one ventilator despite that being a suboptimal solution. It will sneak up on us, too, if we don’t act now.

New York, one of the richest states in the country, has said it can’t afford the ventilators it needs because of the international bidding war. Why do we think Alabama, with its skim budgets, will be able to compete?

The state has not provided a detailed plan of how it plans to get ventilators. Will we buy them? Will we rent them? Will the state pay companies here to begin producing them? These are the answers we need now. And we need clear answers. Because if we are not planning ahead, we need to know. If we are, we need to know.

Alabama cannot be at the last of the pack when so much is at stake.",school_business_closure,119504

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to climb in Kings County as the novel virus continues to disrupt daily life in the borough.

By midday on March 12, health officials had documented over 24 infections in Brooklyn, and 95 citywide — lending Mayor Bill de Blasio to institute a state of emergency in the Five Boroughs, giving the city special powers to potentially restrict travel and exert more control over the functioning of hospitals.

“I don’t think for most of us who have been in public life for quite a long time we’ve seen a situation quite like this,” the mayor said.

New York State, which has been in a declared state of emergency since March 7, leads the nation with over 300 confirmed cases as of March 12.

At a press conference on the state’s response, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a mandatory cancellation of all gatherings with over 500 people.

Out of an abundance of precautions, however, a number of smaller events in Brooklyn have been canceled for fears that the virus might spread.

The Brooklyn Historical Society is shutting down until at least March 31.

The Brooklyn Public Library is halting public programming through at least March 31.

Brooklyn Museum is closed until further notice.

Both the Bay Ridge and Park Slope Saint Patrick’s Day parades are postponed indefinitely.

Under the governor’s mandate banning gatherings of over 500 people, the boroughs large venues including the Barclays Center and Kings Theatre will cease operation until further notice.

Bushwick nightclub House of Yes is shutting down starting Friday.

Most Brooklyn Community Boards are postponing their upcoming meetings.

Many Brooklyn private schools have closed, although Brooklyn’s public schools remain open — including a Park Slope elementary school where a parent tested positive for the virus .

Even with the suspicion of many large processions, the mayor grimly predicted that the citywide total would surpass 1,000 cases citywide by next week.

He said it would give him the flexibility to make decisions necessary to keep the community safe.

But what does a state of emergency actually mean for Monroe County residents?

John Bringewatt, the county's attorney, said it essentially clears a path for Bello to make decisions and ""facilitate the ongoing response to the crisis.""

At the time of Saturday's press conference, Bello had also just announced Monroe County's second confirmed case of COVID-19. Two days later, there are now 10 confirmed cases, with several other patients waiting for test results.

As the situation escalates locally, Bringewatt said the declaration clears a path for Bello's administration to handle the crisis.

Here's a look at what declaring a state of emergency could allow Bello to do:

Niagara County Legislature Chairwoman Becky Wydysh addresses the media.

Though Niagara County still has not confirmed any COVID-19 cases, a state of emergency was declared Sunday – and all school districts will be closed Monday.

Niagara County Legislature Chairwoman Becky Wydysh held a press conference at the Warren J. Rathke Public Safety Training Facility in Lockport to announce these measures.

“There are no positive cases that have been confirmed in Niagara County as of yet, however, yesterday afternoon, we did see Monroe County announce positive cases, and then declare a state of emergency,” Wydysh said. “Neighboring Orleans County also then announced their own state of emergency. Late last evening, three positive cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in Erie County; followed by their declaration of state of emergency just this morning.”

She added, “At this time, with our surrounding counties having done so, we feel it is the appropriate preemptive action to declare a state of emergency here in Niagara County, as of 2 p.m. today.

“Declaring state of emergency allows us the authority and the ability to implement public-protective measures, and continue to receive state and federal resources – should we need them.

“We know that coronavirus is moving in our direction, and that we will likely have positive cases in the near future.”

Wydysh read a statement from the gathered superintendents that stated, “Niagara County has issued a state of emergency and the Niagara County Health Department has recommended that all schools be closed for students effective Monday, March 16, and until further notice. …

“Districts will reassess student attendance weekly. Districts will be providing separate information on staff attendance, academics and food service.”

This closure applies to the Albion, Barker, Lockport, Lewiston-Porter, Medina, Niagara-Wheatfield, North Tonawanda, Newfane, Niagara Falls, Starpoint, Royalton-Hartland, Lyndonville and Wilson school districts.

Lewiston-Porter Superintendent of Schools Paul Casseri said updates would be provided on the district website, https://www.lew-port.com/.

“We are beginning a plan in place to have meals delivered; we want to get that up and running by Tuesday or Wednesday of this week for those students on free and reduced (meal plans),” he said. “All of our students have one-to-one computing, so we’re working on opportunities for students to access work so that we can mitigate any learning regression that may occur for the length of time that we're out.

“Our most important concern is to keep our students safe, our families safe, and our staff safe. Every decision we’re making is based on that.”

Interim Niagara County Sheriff Michael Filicetti provides an update.

Wydysh was joined by Niagara County Director of Public Health Daniel Stapleton, Emergency Services Director Jonathan Schultz, Interim Sheriff Michael Filicetti and Dr. Clark Godshall of Orleans/Niagara BOCES.

Stapleton emphasized, “We are operating as if this coronavirus is already here in Niagara County.”

He explained, “We have 12 individuals that are quarantined in their home. We have done a number of testings, and so far we do not have a case in Niagara County.

“We’re not waiting for a positive case to dictate what we do. We’re looking at the science; we’re looking at the facts; and we’re making decisions based on conversations we’ve had with our experts – and will continue to do that.”

Stapleton explained, “We all know there’s no vaccination for coronavirus; and the earliest possible date we’re looking at is 12-18 months. More likely 18 months. Also, antivirals are not effective. Those, hopefully, will be available within four to five months.”

Godshall said he expected the superintendents to convene and provide another media update in a week.

Wydysh noted, “At this time, it is not our intention to close county buildings, as we do provide necessary services to our residents. We do, however, ask that everyone use good common sense and follow the CDC guidelines when you’re deciding whether or not you should be coming into those offices – for your health, and for that of our employees.”

Both Wydysh and Stapleton advised people to follow Centers for Disease Control preventative measures, such as washing hands; avoiding contact with one’s eyes, nose or mouth; and staying home when possible or when symptomatic.

“Please remember that many of our services can be completed by a phone call or through mail, and we ask you to do that whenever possible,” Wydysh said. “We also ask you to do that in other areas of your life. Take precautions where you can. When shopping, seeking entertainment, visiting friends and family – again, not just for your health, but for those who you might come into contact with, who have underlying health concerns.”

Stapleton said, “Do those things that you can do on a daily basis to reduce the risk to you and those that you love.

“Also, if you have symptoms consistent with coronavirus – which are identical to the seasonal flu – call your personal physicians before you go to their office. Do not go there directly; talk to them. If you do not have a primary care physician or can’t get a hold of yours, and you’re going to an immediate care center, or the local emergency department, call them first. Don’t go there. Don't go there and spread the disease that you might have.”

Last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued state declarations limiting attendance at public events to less than 500 people, mandating smaller events and restaurants cut their capacity by 50%, and stating only medically necessary visits will be allowed at nursing homes.

At that time, New York State Health Department Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said, ""Our No. 1 priority is protecting the public health, and every action the governor and the state of New York have taken thus far have been in furtherance of that goal. Public health experts have been clear that limiting large public gatherings where there is potential for close contact is a critical way to slow the spread of this virus. This regulation will help keep people healthy and safe.""

""Without a cohesive message, there is fear,"" Day told the crowd gathered on the steps. including Rockland County Commissioner of Health, Dr. Patricia Schnabel Ruppert, all of the county's public schools superintendents and members of the Rockland County Legislature.

Ruppert urged residents to staying home as much as possible because exposure to the virus could happen anywhere in the county. Those who can work from home should do so, she said.

""I have been advising for a week that people practice social distancing,"" Ruppert said, referring to the practice of keeping 6 feet between individuals. ""Now I want residents to consider staying home as much as you can.""

Schools to close

All public schools that serve grades K-12 are to suspend all classroom and extracurricular functions starting Tuesday. The closure will be for two weeks.

Private schools must close starting Wednesday.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced similar school closures Monday, due to start Wednesday.

Day's order also mandates that universities, colleges and other public and private educational facilities shut to all students by Wednesday, except for resident students, who will be allowed to access dorms and dining facilities.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday that as schools shut down, he wanted schools to figure out childcare options for essential personnel, like medical providers and first responders. Officials said that local options for that are still being worked out.

Rockland BOCES Superintendent Mary Jean Marsico said the public schools were committed to making sure children would have their nutritional and educational needs met during the closure.

Public schools have come up with ways to deliver food to students who receive free and reduced meals at school. ""We're not here to make things worse,"" Marsico said. ""We're here to accommodate.""

Nyack public schools, for example, developed food delivery sites at the Nyack Center and Waldron Terrace. Community members, including school board trustees, were on hand Monday at Nyack Center to pack up and pass out bagged breakfast and lunch. Food will be distributed every day from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. until school is back in session, district officials said.

During Rockland County's measles outbreak, some yeshivas were hit with fines after the county reported they didn't adhere to regulations about keeping unvaccinated students home.

County officials have pointed to their preparedness for coronavirus because of the lessons learned during the measles outbreak, which lasted from October 2018 through September 2019 and sickened 312.

Region acts

Putnam County Executive MaryEllen Odell declared a state of emergency on Friday that went into effect Monday; Westchester County was expected to declare a state of emergency Monday.

Andrew Cuomo said in a conference call with reporters.

The governor also announced the state would be opening a drive-thru coronavirus testing facility for Rockland this week, although he didn't pinpoint a location. Last Friday the state put up a tent at the Anthony Wayne Recreation Area, but it was taken down the following day.

Washington County declared a state of emergency Friday in response to the coronavirus pandemic and its effects on southwestern Utah.

The three-member county commission voted unanimously for the measure, which they said should help stabilize local businesses, at a special meeting in St. George.

The declaration includes three categories of focus to assist the local economy -- a “Stay Greater” campaign to encourage residents to order take out meals from local restaurants, a small business stabilization loan program and a program to distribute accurate information to the area’s most vulnerable, specifically seniors.

“We’re not trying to send additional concern into the community, this is an action we have to take because we want to bring solutions to the table,” Commission Chair Victor Iverson said.

Commissioner Dean Cox, who had served as an emergency services director for 20 years, said this is only the seventh or eighth time the county has taken such measures. Nationally, President Donald Trump has announced a national emergency. Also on the state level, Gov. Gary Herbert has made similar declarations.

Cox said it’s unusual to see the emergency declarations going from the top down, saying usually they start on a local level. However, the commissioners said they wanted to communicate to the public that the county is using available resources to help people who are struggling at this time.

“We have two pandemics going on, the coronavirus is a pandemic. But I believe we have a pandemic of fear going on … we’re not trying to spread more fear, we’re in this together with business owners [and residents],” Iverson said.

The crisis has forced widespread closures and cancelations across southwestern Utah. Public schools are closed, area church services are on hold and various businesses from restaurants to retail stores have either scaled back hoursor closed completely.

Popular events like the IRONMAN St. George have been postponed, and county efforts to attract tourism dollars have been rolled back.

Utah has now reported a total of 112 cases of the new coronavirus, an increase of 33 over the previous day, according to an update posted Friday by the state health department.

The figures include 102 Utah residents and 10 visitors, with most of the cases reported so far out of northern Utah. Salt Lake County had reported 44 cases, with 28 out of Summit County.

Southwestern Utah has only one confirmed case so far, and that resident is the same person who was reported several weeks ago after returning from a cruise.

A total of 2,147 people had been tested statewide.

President Donald Trump announced new federal actions Friday in efforts to slow the spread of the new coronavirus and relieve the economic effects of the pandemic.

Meanwhile, Tax Day has been moved back to July. And California, New York and Pennsylvania took the boldest action yet to slow the spread of coronavirus.

The U.S. hit two grim landmarks on Friday — at least 210 deaths and over 14,600 confirmed cases. Worldwide, the death toll has topped 10,400, as Italy saw its biggest one-day increase on Friday. There are more than 255,000 confirmed cases around the globe, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.

WHITE PLAINS – Westchester County Executive George Latimer declared a State of Emergency Monday as the fight to slow the coronavirus outbreak grinds most aspects of daily life to a halt.

Latimer’s emergency declaration and a related executive order will shut down all public and private schools in the county for a minimum of two weeks starting Wednesday. Westchester has 44 public schools and the majority decided to close on their own prior to the order.

The declaration follows an order by the states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut that will close casinos, gyms and movie theaters and limit bars and restaurants to delivery and takeout. All public functions of 50 people or more are on hold in an effort to maximize social distancing.

“We’re all very much aware that we’re facing something that we’ve never faced before,” Latimer said at a news conference on the steps of the Michaelian municipal building. “We’re going through a test the likes of which we have not experienced in our adult lifetime here in this country and we’re trying to make decisions as we go along to the best of our ability.”

Westchester was an early hot spot of positive tests for the coronavirus, leading the state government to set up a “containment area” in the city of New Rochelle. County-owned Glen Island Park is now the site of a state-run testing center where those with appointments drive up and are tested from their cars.

Sherlita Amler, county commissioner of health, said efforts like the closure of schools should be taken seriously to reduce the risk of exposure. The ultimate goal is to try to reduce the number of people needing medical attention at the same time.

There is no vaccine or accepted medical treatment for the virus and hospitals can't handle the projected peaks. That is why social distancing is important, Amler said at the news conference.

""If we do these things, we can keep these numbers low,"" Amler said. ""If we don’t do these things, we could see these numbers dramatically rise which is exactly what we’re trying to prevent.""

Alternate medical sites

Latimer said the county is looking at sites that serve as emergency medical areas in the face of a surge of needed hospital beds. Other sites in the county could be used to isolate those who’ve contracted the virus who might not be able to self-quarantine.

Potential sites named by Latimer include Dorral Arrowwood, a recently-closed hotel and conference center in Rye Brook, the long shuttered United Hospital in Port Chester and the former College of New Rochelle.

County-owned parks, including Rye Playland amusement park, could potentially be used as additional drive through testing sites if needed by the state. As of Monday, there were 950 confirmed cases in New York, with seven deaths related to the virus and its resulting disease COVID-19.

Westchester has 220 confirmed cases, and Latimer said the county is working to share breakdown by municipalities to help local law enforcement. An estimated 17% of state cases have resulted in hospitalization, Latimer said.

The disruption in social norms and the economy is secondary to limiting the spread of the global pandemic and saving lives.

“Until the contagion is controlled and reversed we are in a free fall situation with the society economically,” Latimer said, and noted it was not just a local problem. “When the contagion is over, when it has run its course, when we see just how successful we are or are not, we’re going to have a large economic hole to dig out.”

Latimer’s declaration will last at least 30 days, unless he rescinds it before then. The closure of schools can be extended beyond 14 days if needed. Further coronavirus-related executive orders may follow as needed, he said.

The county action follows a state of emergency declaration from Gov. Andrew Cuomo on March 7 and a national emergency declaration from President Donald Trump on March 13.

Neighboring Putnam County declared a state of emergency on Friday and Rockland County also issued an emergency declaration Monday.

WARSAW — Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), a state of emergency will go into effect in Wyoming County at 12 a.m. Sunday, the Wyoming County Health Department said tonight.

COVID-19 is an infection associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness. It appears to be transmitted from person to person predominantly through droplet transmission and, if spread in the population, could have significant public health consequences, the health department said.

“Although there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Wyoming County to date, this situation is rapidly evolving and the threat of this virus is imminent to the citizens and visitors of Wyoming County,” the county said. “It is necessary that Wyoming County be proactive and fully prepared to deal with its effects.”

Wyoming County Board of Supervisors Chairman Jerry Davis said today, “I ... exercise the authority given me ... under New York State Executive Law, for the purpose of procuring goods and services and to render all required and available assistance to municipalities and school districts that is vital to the security, well-being and health and safety of the citizens of Wyoming County.

“The state of emergency does not, in any way, impact travel and county operations will continue unchanged unless otherwise advised,” Davis said. “I hereby direct all departments and agencies of Wyoming County to take the steps necessary to protect life and property, public infrastructure and provide such emergency assistance deemed necessary. The state of emergency will remain in effect for 30 days or until rescinded or renewed by a subsequent order.”

“Travel-related cases and community-contact transmission of COVID-19 have been documented throughout New York state and on March 7, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a disaster emergency in New York state.",state_of_emergency,41531

In a proactive move, the Alexander County Board of Commissioners declared a State of Emergency for COVID-19 (coronavirus). Commissioners held an emergency meeting with county staff on Tuesday, March 17 to discuss the virus and ways to contain the spread of the illness locally.

Commissioners heard reports from Emergency Services, Health Department, Social Services, and Administration, as well as information from a conference call with the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners which provided updates from various state agencies.

“Alexander County currently has zero confirmed cases of COVID-19, but we felt it would be a wise decision to be proactive and let our citizens know that we believe this could become a very serious health issue. The declaration also positions the county for potential state and federal funds if conditions worsen,” said Ryan Mayberry, Chairman of the Alexander County Board of Commissioners. “With this declaration, we are getting ahead of the game, and will hopefully increase awareness of this virus and save lives. Please take this seriously. The magnitude of this virus and its effect on our county, state, nation, and world is not yet known, but together we will get through this potential crisis and emerge even stronger.”

Leeanne Whisnant, Director of Alexander County Consolidated Human Services, informed the board that while there are no confirmed cases yet, there are five (5) households under quarantine after being tested for the virus. Test results are still pending as the tests require 12-72 hours in a lab. If positive, the test will then be sent to a CDC lab, which requires an additional 12-72 hours for results.

“The health, safety, and welfare of our citizens is paramount as we all work together to contain this pandemic,” Whisnant related. “We encourage our citizens to practice good hygiene and use common sense to help us contain this virus. The more we can all stay at home and have less interaction with others, the better off we will be and the less this highly-contagious virus will spread in Alexander County and beyond. We appreciate everyone’s cooperation.”

Following the emergency meeting, Alexander County Government has implemented a mitigation strategy to slow the spread of COVID-19 (coronavirus), including the closing of certain facilities, reduced staffing, canceling meetings and events, and other measures.

Closings and other mitigation measures

Effective Wednesday, March 18, the following changes will occur at these Alexander County facilities to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus:

• All Alexander County parks, including Rocky Face Park, will be closed to the public.

• The Alexander County Senior Center will be closed to the public.

• Alexander County DSS Congregate Meal sites will be closed; however, meals will still be delivered.

• The Alexander County Library will be closed for customers; however, all three branches will be staffed to provide curbside book/movie delivery and utilization of the book drop at the back door. Due dates have been extended through April 1.

• The Alexander County Services Center will be closed to the public; however, tax payments can be made using the drive-thru and other departments can be contacted by phone for assistance.

• The Alexander County License Plate Agency will be limited to 10 clients at a time, per NCDOT restrictions.

• The Alexander County Cooperative Extension Center will have two people in the office each day on a rotating schedule, per guidance from the state. The center will continue farm and one-on-one visits while maintaining the recommended six-foot social distance at all times.

• No work-related out-of-county travel for Alexander County employees, with the exception of law enforcement and EMS.

• Signage will be placed on doors at county facilities to discourage those who are sick from entering.

• All North Carolina superior and district court proceedings will be postponed for at least 30 days, with some exceptions, effective March 16.

Alexander County staff is working to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) for health, EMS, emergency management, law enforcement, and other employees who could potentially have contact with citizens who have contracted the virus.

On a state level, NC Governor Roy Cooper announced an executive order in response to COVID-19 that closes restaurants and bars for dine-in customers but allows them to continue takeout and delivery orders, effective at 5:00 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17.

On March 10, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidance advising against gatherings of 50 or more people. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on March 10 to provide access to state funding. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 virus a global pandemic. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13, which provides access to $50 billion for US states and territories. Since that time, the President has recommended avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people.

In North Carolina, 40 cases of COVID-19 have been reported with no deaths. In the United States, confirmed cases total 5,700 with 96 deaths; however, there has been a testing shortage coupled with the delay between testing and obtaining results, so officials believe the true figure could be higher. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 195,000 people with approximately 7,800 deaths.

How to protect yourself and others

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises citizens to: avoid close contact with people who are sick; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; stay home if you are sick; cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue; and clean/disinfect frequently touched surfaces or objects (tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, sinks, etc.). The agency also advises citizens to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. In addition, avoid close contact with people who are sick, and put a six-foot distance between yourself and other people (i.e. social distancing). Learn more at www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/prevention.html.

What to do if you are sick

If you are sick with COVID-19 or think you might have it, you should stay home as most people who are mildly ill with COVID-19 are able to recover at home. Wear a facemask when you are around other people. Do not leave, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas. Stay in touch with your doctor but call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you feel worse or you think it is an emergency. If you in a high-risk category (age 65+, underlying health issues, or immune-compromised), you should get tested for COVID-19 by making arrangements with the local health department, doctor’s office, or hospital.

What is COVID-19 and Coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals and humans. Human coronaviruses commonly circulate in the United States and usually cause mild illnesses like the common cold. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that was identified in Wuhan, China, and is now spreading throughout the world.

Statement from the Alexander County Board of Commissioners

Alexander County declares State of Emergency for COVID-19 (Coronavirus)

On Tuesday, March 17, the Alexander County Board of Commissioners held an emergency meeting to discuss COVID-19 (coronavirus) and how the county could play a proactive role in helping contain the spread of this illness.

After much deliberation, the Board of Commissioners believed it would be in the best interest of Alexander County citizens, businesses, and employees to declare a State of Emergency.

Commissioners heard reports from Emergency Services, Health Department, Social Services, and Administration, as well as information from a conference call with the North Carolina Association of County Commissioners which provided updates from various state agencies.

While Alexander County currently has zero confirmed cases of COVID-19, the Board felt it would be a wise decision to be proactive and let our citizens know that we believe this could become a very serious health issue.

With this declaration, we believe that Alexander County is getting ahead of the game by increasing awareness of COVID-19, implementing facility closings, ensuring employee safety, and minimizing contact between people — all with the goal of ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of our citizens, and possibly saving lives.

The declaration also positions the county for potential state and federal funds if conditions worsen.

Please take this seriously. The magnitude of this virus and its effect on our county, state, nation, and world is not yet known, but together we will get through this potential crisis and emerge even stronger.

Seated to her right is Nathan Dowless, the director of Emergency Management. -

ELIZABETHTOWN — Bladen County has been declared in a State of Emergency, two county employee policies have been created, and publishing of delinquent tax listings was pushed back two months.

In an emergency meeting just shy of 90 minutes late Friday afternoon in Superior Courtroom No. 2 of the Bladen County Courthouse, county commissioners tasked themselves with receiving an update on COVID-19 and acting in response. There is yet to be a confirmed case of coronavirus in the county. All but one of the moves was approved 8-0; Commissioner Ashley Trivette had a work conflict and could not attend.

North Carolina has already been declared in a State of Emergency by Gov. Roy Cooper, and President Donald Trump had issued a declaration of national emergency. The county action enacts its Emergency Operations Plan, with mutual assistance compacts and agreements, and with protocol specific to Emergency Management, health and medical services departments of the county, and the Sheriff’s Office.

It also is a designation that potentially could have financial implications, specifically from FEMA — the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Dr. Terri Duncan and Nathan Dowless briefed commissioners at the outset. She’s the director of the Health Department and he’s the director of Emergency Management. Commissioners peppered them with questions and each was answered.

“There are a lot of rumors going around in the county,” Duncan said. “I ask you to remember to instill in people fact not fear.”

She said 12 people have been tested, and that includes tests of Bladen residents conducted in four other counties. There’s a four- to eight-day wait to get results, Duncan said.

“We appreciate your support to this point,” Duncan said. “We don’t know where we’re going in the next hour, but we are resilient people. We’ll make decisions on the current guidelines we have.”

Commissioners and the two directors emphasized how rapidly conditions change, including by the hour.

Dowless said there is a nationwide shortage of masks, isolation gowns and thermometers. He also pointed out a crucial fact for the county receiving assistance, such as when a hurricane hits. Usually there is help from other parts of the state and even the country; in this case, he said, “Everybody is experiencing this.”

He said 84 of 100 counties in the state had declared a State of Emergency; that list grew by at least one at the same time as Bladen acted when New Hanover County declared about 5 p.m.

Two forms of compassionate help are probable from Duke Energy and Star Communications. About $2,500 in gift cards from Duke is likely to be spread around the county, and seven to nine WiFi temporary hotspots are going to be established by Star to help students doing online learning while schools are closed. Star is also putting similar spots in Sampson County, where its headquarters are located.

More details on each will be forthcoming soon; Star may put the hotspots in as soon as Monday.

The county took action to suspend public access to all county buildings with the exception of the courthouse. It joins multiple Bladen municipalities that have already done so to include Elizabethtown, White Lake and Clarkton.

The panel passed policies titled “COVID-19 Temporary Teleworking Policy” and “COVID-19 Temporary Advanced Sick Leave Policy.” There was considerable discussion on each, with the work from home principle passing 8-0 and the sick leave action gaining approval 5-3.

Chairman Ray Britt, Vice Chairman David Gooden, Charles Ray Peterson, Daniel Dowless and Russell Priest were in favor, and Dr. Ophelia Munn-Goins, Michael Cogdell and Arthur Bullock were against.

Those opposed rejected the last line: “Following the exhaustion of advanced sick leave an employee may apply for leave without pay as provided in the Bladen County Personnel Policy.” The trio wanted it amended in some manner to say the county would revisit the situation if this happens because of the virus.

The voices of Britt and Peterson and the head-nods of others voting both in favor and against confirmed that the panel has every intention to, as more than one voice on opposite sides of the vote was heard to say, “take care of employees.”

The policy enables employees — and County Manager Greg Martin confirmed several dozen are new and without much accrued sick and vacation leave — to apply for advanced sick leave. There are five requirements.

The teleworking policy could potentially keep many county employees working. Its purpose is “to provide a means to continue necessary County business during a situation as authorized by the County Manager.”

In pushing back tax listings, Britt said he wanted to spare county residents making difficult financial choices as the virus ascends to its peak. Normally, the Bladen Journal publishes those listings before March 31. The new date must come before June 1, meaning latest publication would be Friday, May 29.

The board’s other action was to cancel meeting Monday, when a 5 p.m. special meeting was to address the fiscal budget for 2020-21 and a regular meeting was set for 6:30 p.m.

The board may meet in emergency session as the virus pandemic dictates; otherwise, the next scheduled regular meeting is April 6.

ASHEVILLE - Buncombe County has declared a local state of emergency in response to the global spread of new coronavirus COVID-19.

The county's board of commissioners was scheduled to consider the measure at its March 17 meeting, but board Chairman Brownie Newman said the morning of March 12 he had decided to take action sooner. He signed the declaration at the county's 2:30 p.m. media briefing on behalf of the entire board.

""I do have the authority to do it as commission chair,"" Newman told the Citizen Times that morning. ""I think we just want to be sending the message to the community that this is a very important health concern, there are definite things that individuals, businesses, local governments can do to reduce the risk of the spread of it.

""We want people to be taking all those reasonable steps now. We don't want to send the message that it's not something people should be very conscious of going forward.""

The declaration makes Buncombe eligible for state and federal resources that may be made available to communities to address the coronavirus, according to Newman. It enables all units of government in Buncombe too work together in the response.

Commissioners still to vote on virus-related budget amendment

County management proposed the declaration of a local state of emergency ""to ensure that COVID-19 remains controlled and that residents and visitors in Buncombe County remain safe and secure,"" a county memo states.

More on the local COVID-19 response:

County staff also suggested a budget amendment that would allow the county to allocate $250,000 from its fund balance for public health and human services costs ""in the event of necessary expenditures.""

Newman said commissioners will vote on the amendment March 17.

COVID-19: A global pandemic, tests out from WNC

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic March 11, as the WHO director general announced more than 100,000 cases of the respiratory illness in over 100 countries. The WHO reported early this month that the death rate for the virus was 3.4%.

North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency on March 10, activating the Emergency Operations Center, which will help agencies coordinate their responses, according to a press release from Cooper's office.

A state of emergency also allows the state government to protect consumers from price gouging, increases county health departments' access to state funds and makes it easier to purchase essential medical supplies, the release said.

As of the afternoon of March 12, no confirmed cases of the virus had been reported in Buncombe County. During the county's media briefing, medical director Dr. Jennifer Mullendore said there are COVID-19 tests from WNC pending, but none had been returned with a presumed positive result.

Statewide, a total of 14 people had tested positive for COVID-19 as of that afternoon, according to a release from the Department of Health and Human Services and announcements from the Mecklenburg County Public Health Department.

Four of the five recently identified cases are a Forsyth County couple, a Johnston County resident and a Durham resident who tested positive in another state, the release said.

The fifth and sixth cases are in Mecklenburg County, according to the County's Department of Public Health.

Recommendations from officials

Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services, said at a press conference that people at high risk — those over the age of 65 or with underlying health conditions — should avoid large gatherings as much as possible, including church services, concerts and sporting events.

CLOSE Public officials urge precautions over coronavirus Wochit

In general, public officials have urged the public to take preventative measures similar to those taken to prevent the spread of the flu: wash hands for 20 seconds, including the top and bottom of hands and between fingers; cover coughs and sneezes; practice social distancing; try not to touch your own face and sanitize regularly touched surfaces.

If you think you have COVID-19, officials advise that you first call your doctor. If you do not have a doctor, call the Buncombe health department's communicable disease line at 828-250-5109.

Shortly after, the county declared a state of emergency.

A release from the county said the Chatham County Public Health Department was notified of the positive tests by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. To protect the privacy of the residents, no further information about the individuals will be shared by the health department.

“As testing for the new coronavirus ramps up, we are expecting to see more cases,” said Chatham County Public Health Director Layton Long. “We urge residents to stay vigilant and follow the guidance of local, state and national public health officials.”

The Board of Chatham County Commissioners declared a state of emergency shortly after the release about the new cases was shared. The declaration follows Orange County and the state of North Carolina making the same decision.

“This proactive step by the [Board of Commissioners] to activate the County’s Emergency Operations Plan,” said Chatham County Manager Dan LaMontagne in a statement, “allows for reallocation of staff and authorizes the County Manager to take all necessary actions to protect lives and property, and to ensure safety and public order.”

The first case discovered in Chatham County was the second case identified in North Carolina. The resident had traveled to Italy in late February and experienced flu-like symptoms.

The total number of identified cases in North Carolina as of Tuesday afternoon is 40, according to state health officials.

At this time, the State of Emergency stipulates expectations of County staff. There are no further restrictions, such as a curfew or prohibiting the sale of alcohol, being placed on the community.

The declaration, signed by Ronald Gatling, chairman of the Hertford County Commissioners, says, in part, “control measures could be place in effect immediately to implement plans for the prevention of, preparation for, response to and recovery from any and all emergency situations that may result from the impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic. These control measures will be coordinated with federal, state and local agencies for the orderly protection, treatment, and rehabilitation of affected persons.”

Hertford County officials said as of 5 pm on Thursday there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the county.

The State of Emergency will remain in place until rescinded.

Friday morning, Hertford County Emergency Management Director Chris Smith sent out a spreadsheet that listed local priorities, to include protecting public health – especially those of the most vulnerable populations (the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions); minimizing public disruption to the extent possible while also preventing future spread of COVID-19; and continue to provide essential public health services and essential governmental services.

On Friday afternoon, North Carolina officials – to include Emergency Management and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) – conducted an online press conference.

Information gained from that conference included there were 137 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 38 counties. There is one confirmed case of “community transmission” – meaning the person had not traveled to a known area of infection.

It was noted that all 115 public school districts statewide are serving meals to schoolchildren, either by pick-up or some method of delivery.

Childcare facilities across the state are weighing their options to remain open. The state has sent those facilities a list of safety guidelines to follow as it relates to COVID-19, to include proper sanitization/disinfection methods.

As of Friday, there is no state mandated order for North Carolina residents to shelter in place, nor is there an order to close non-essential businesses.

Mike Sprayberry, Director of North Carolina Emergency Management, encouraged state residents not to purchase items in excess.

“Our grocery stores/supermarkets are open and our supply chain is not broken,” Sprayberry said. “There is a lot of bad information out there, especially on social media. I would recommend for all of our citizens to get their information from a trusted source, to include DHHS and the CDC (Centers for Disease Control).”

Earlier today, President Donald Trump said he is hoping the United States will be reopened by Easter as he weighs how to relax nationwide social-distancing guidelines to put some workers back on the job during the coronavirus outbreak.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged to its best day since 1933 as Congress and the White House neared a deal on Tuesday to inject nearly $2 trillion of aid into an economy ravaged by the coronavirus.

FORSYTH COUNTY, N.C. -- Forsyth County has declared a state of emergency in response to the coronavirus.

County officials released a statement, saying:

""In conjunction with the President’s and the Governor’s declarations of state of emergency pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, Forsyth County, North Carolina, has declared a state of emergency effective March 13, 2020. This emergency declaration allows the county to claim and receive reimbursement for labor, supplies, and materials associated with its COVID-19 response. No civil restrictions are imposed in the declaration, but the County has the ability to impose restrictions if the need arises.""

President Donald Trump declared a national emergency Friday afternoon, citing coronavirus concerns.

There are currently 1,920 official cases of COVID-19 in the US and 41 confirmed deaths.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Trump administration are laboring to finish agreement on a coronavirus aid package.

Pelosi held a news conference Friday to outline the Families First Coronavirus Response Act in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

House Democrats are expected to push the bill through Friday that focuses on help for the American family.

""The three most important parts of this bill are testing, testing, testing,"" said Pelosi.

""This legislation facilitates free coronavirus testing for everyone who needs a test, including the uninsured. We can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate determination of its scale and scope so that we can pursue the precise science-based response that is necessary.""

One major hang-up between Democrats and Republicans was reportedly the paid family and medical leave provision, with Republicans pushing to structure it in a way that it could be implemented quickly and avoid undue burdens on employers.

By Friday morning that issue had appeared largely resolved with the administration, but there seemed to be lingering concerns among House Republicans.

The coronavirus aid package will also give USDA authority to allow states to provide emergency food stamp assistance to families whose children could miss out on free or reduced-price meals if schools are closed.

Under the current proposal, the child’s school must be closed for no less than five consecutive days for families to be eligible.

Pelosi's comments come less than an hour from President Donald Trump expected further response to coronavirus.

Worldwide, 137,000 people have been infected and more than 5,000 have died, but half of those who had the virus have already recovered.

Most patients have mild or moderate symptoms such as a fever or cold, but severe symptoms including pneumonia can occur, especially in the elderly and people with existing health problems.

North Carolina,Gaston,43905,https://www.gastongazette.com/news/20200315/gaston-county-declares-state-of-emergency-due-to-coronavirus-threat,Gaston County declares state of emergency due to coronavirus threat,"Gaston County leaders declared a state of emergency and laid out evolving efforts on how they plan to deal with the threat of the coronavirus during a press conference Sunday afternoon.

The gathering at the Gaston County Courthouse brought together officials representing law enforcement, the school system, the court system and the local hospital to address efforts to deal with the pandemic within this area. It came as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose to 32 across the state, and four in nearby Mecklenburg County.

Chris Dobbins, director of the Gaston County Department of Health and Human Services, said no positive cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed here. But he warned against putting too much emphasis on that.

""That should not give anyone a false sense of security,"" he said. ""There’s a very high probability that we have the virus in our community.""

As part of the declaration, the county is restricting all public or social gatherings to 50 people or less. Gaston County Police Chief Joe Ramey said they will have the ability to charge and prosecute violators, though he urged residents to self-police for the good of the community.

Courts in will remain open on a limited basis, as the majority of district and superior courts across the state will be closed for 30 days. Gaston County District Court Judge John Greenlee said two courtrooms will be running consistently during normal business hours to handle certain matters, and judges will be available, though jury trials that have yet to begin will be suspended for 30 days.

Anyone with questions about the court schedule is advised to call 704-852-3100.

""This is unprecedented in the state of North Carolina, and certainly in Gaston County,"" Greenlee said.

Gov. Roy Cooper on Saturday ordered all K-12 public schools across the state to close for two weeks. Gaston County Schools Superintendent Jeff Booker said local officials are developing packets of information to send home with the roughly 31,000 students in the local system, so that learning can continue. He also unveiled a plan to provide meals for the 65 percent of the student population that receives some form of food assistance.

""We’ve already begun a plan to activate our summer feeding program on Tuesday,"" he said.

‘We must be proactive’

Gaston County Commission Chairman Tracy Philbeck said the restriction on gatherings does not apply to licensed businesses, healthcare facilities, schools, government offices and daycares.

""Employers are encouraged to allow employees to work from home, stagger work schedules and implement in-person work space arrangements that optimize work space between employees,"" he said. ""The reason we have chosen to decrease the size of public and social gatherings is based on specific community needs. Based on the information from our health care officials and surveying critical public services, a spike in confirmed cases has the potential to put in jeopardy our ability to handle patients, and keep essential public services operating efficiently and effectively to address our community needs.""

Philbeck said the declaration will allow the county to take advantage of possible state and federal funding and allow its operations center and municipalities to operate in an efficient fashion to address the coronavirus. He said the county is determined to stay ahead of the game in this situation.

""We cannot afford to wait and see what happens. That is not responsible leadership,"" he said. ""We must be proactive, and when we get through this crisis – and we will – I will be fine looking back and saying we did too much. I refuse to look back and say we did not do enough.""

Dr. Todd Davis, chief medical officer of CaroMont Health, said the leadership team at CaroMont Regional Medical Center has been planning extensively since January for the possible arrival of the coronavirus. They have done that by collaborating with everyone from public health officials to paramedics.

""We have created a tiered response, allowing us to be able to react to the needs of the patient volume we potentially could have,"" he said. ""I’m extremely confident our health care providers will show the type of professionalism and compassion you expect from them, and we will do everything to make sure our patients and our staff are safe.""

‘Social caring’

People who are young and healthy may not be as susceptible to COVID-19, but they can still be carriers of the virus who could spread it to people who are more at risk, such as older residents and people with weakened immune systems, Dobbins said.

""You may have heard the term ‘social distancing’ a lot in previous days,"" he said. ""What I would like you to think about is another term: ‘social caring.’ Because that’s where we are going to need this community to go moving forward. We’ve got the expertise, we’ve got the resources, we’ve got the support. Now is an opportunity for us to help each other.""

Philbeck encouraged residents to stay away from crowds, practice proper hygiene and call before attending any type of function. That will help to protect people in the community who are most vulnerable to COVID-19, including senior citizens, those already under a doctor’s care, those with underlying health issues, and health care workers, he said.

Rather than asking churches to close, Philbeck said they are requesting that they keep gatherings to 50 people or less, possibly by holding multiple services throughout the day. Not taking the county’s recommendations seriously could have horrible effects, he said.

""If we have a small spike in coronavirus cases in Gaston County, I’m thinking 10 or 15, it could literally put our jail in jeopardy, our hospital in jeopardy, and our health and human services.

""We could literally have to decide who gets a respirator and who doesn’t. It’s that serious.""

Dobbins said they do not yet have the ability to test ""anybody and everybody"" who wants to know if they have the virus. But people who have questions or concerns are being urged to call the county’s community hotline, at 704-862-5303. It’s operational from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays.

""We do anticipate the calls are going to increase and we are looking at expanding those hours,"" he said.

Plan for the court system

The state constitution mandates that courts must remain open at all times. But North Carolina Chief Justice Cheri Beasley’s decision on Friday to issue an emergency declaration for courts across the state means that they will only be open on a limited basis for the next 30 days, Greenlee said.

""There are some things we cannot continue for 30 days,"" he said.

One courtroom at the local courthouse will operate normally and handle things such as domestic violence protective orders, no contact/harassment/stalking orders, and allow inmates to have their bonds reviewed and make first appearances. A second courtroom will be open to handle all other emergency matters, and fulfill the constitution by allowing for due process, Greenlee said.

Jury trials will be suspended for 30 days, though a sole jury trial that is currently in panel in Gaston County will continue, possibly being wrapped up by early next week, Greenlee said. The grand jury has also been suspended.

The Gaston County Courthouse will remain open, and the clerks’ office will continue to accept filings. But Greenlee said residents should only come there if they absolutely have to.

""I ask all citizens who have cases scheduled in district court over the next 30 days, up until April 16, do not come to the courthouse to come to your court date,"" he said. ""Between the clerk’s office and the DA’s office, there will a concerted effort next week to get court dates on every case that’s scheduled for the next 30 days. That’s thousands.""

Anyone with a domestic violence protective order should come to court as scheduled, Greenlee said. But most other residents should wait to get a notice in the next 10 days regarding when their court date has been rescheduled.

""If you have a civil or domestic case, contact your attorney or the clerk’s office and they’ll give you the procedure on how to get a new court date set,"" he said.

School system response

Booker said the governor’s decision to close schools for two weeks will have ""a drastic impact on Gaston County."" He thanked students, parents and employees for their patience and understanding to this point.

Staff have been told to report for a teacher workday on Monday, where more will be discussed about the week and month ahead.

Booker said information will be disseminated to parents and employees in the same way that it is done for inclement weather, and the school system’s website will be updated continuously.

""For our students, we are developing packets of information we can give you so that learning can go on,"" he said. ""But let me stress that nothing can replace the value of our highly qualified teachers. We will do the best, and we will work to make things available, recognizing that 65 percent of our population receives some form of assistance with food.""

Booker said they have selected 10 sites that they plan to use as distribution points in activating the summer feeding program Tuesday. More details were being worked out on that plan Sunday afternoon, but he emphasized plans could change quickly.

""The governor may come out with a different plan,"" he said. ""Things are evolving and as the state empowers and asks us to do things, we will respond.""

Booker said they have been talking with the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction and internet providers about the potential for some type of online learning.

""What we know is that we do not have unlimited internet availability for 31,000 of our students,"" he said. ""That is the purpose of introducing learning packets, so we can utilize them in the interim. Measures are being taken to talk to some of the major providers about providing free access, but that will take some time.""

The tighter restrictions go into effect on Wednesday at 5 p.m.

The county first declared a State of Emergency on March 13, authorizing the county to enact a variety of different restrictions and prohibitions as the situation warrants.

Chairman of the Board Jeff Phillips announced in a recorded statement that as of this week Guilford County identified its first case of community spread, which is a COVID-19 positive test with no connection to recent travel or another COVID-19 case.

""We are now entering a challenging phase in a rapidly changing situation. We need every member of our community to follow the CDC recommendations, to cover their sneeze and cough, to stay home when sick, to wash their hands frequently and reduce social interactions,"" Phillips said in a statement.

Phillips urged residents that if these measures are taken seriously to slow the spread of the virus, there is hope that the county can postpone the need for more drastic measures such as those taken by larger communities.

The Harnett County Board of Commissioners added their jurisdiction to the growing list of towns, counties and states declaring a state of emergency.

The action came at the conclusion of the board of commissioners meeting Monday night in Lillington.

Board Chairman Howard Penny issued a statement before reading a proclamation that became effective at 8 p.m. on March 16.

“We understand that many of our residents are concerned about the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus across the United States of America, the State of North Carolina and within Harnett County,” Penny said reading from a prepared statement. “While the threat of this pandemic is very real, please know that county officials — including the Harnett County Health Department and Harnett County Emergency Management — have been actively preparing for potential impacts from this coronavirus and are staying on top of new developments.”

In the statement, Penny said the board understands the concerns of citizens over the COVID-19 virus and urged residents not to panic.

“We ask that citizens remain calm and continue following the guidelines established by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control during this event,” Penny said. “These guidelines are in place for your safety and those of your fellow residents. The more people adhere to these guidelines, the sooner the coronavirus threat will pass.”

Penny also tried to reassure residents not to panic as the number of cases, which has grown to four as of Tuesday morning, in Harnett County rise. He said despite the measures currently in place to reduce the risk, the chances are there will be more positive tests.

“Even with these measures in place, it is reasonable to anticipate that Harnett County will see additional positive tests,” Penny said. “This should not be cause for panic. The health and well-being of our citizens is the top priority of the Harnett County Board of Commissioners and county staff.”

Benson

In addition to Harnett County’s declaration, the town board of commissioners of Benson also issued a declaration during a special session Monday night.

Benson Media Coordinator Tyler Douglas said the move will allow the town manager and police chief to implement certain actions.

“This will also allow the town manager and the police chief to augment building access, implement safety measures, and institute a curfew if necessary in relation to keeping staff and residents safe from the spread of the virus,” Douglas said. “Currently, there are no reported cases of COVID-19 in Benson, but due to reports of the virus in neighboring areas, Benson commissioners felt compelled to take every available measure to ensure the safety of town employees and residents.”

At the present time, the Benson Town Hall remains open and operating under normal business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. However, the majority of the building is closed to the public. Residents can still use the main door, go up the stairs and pay utility bills. The main hallway offices, planning office and downstairs offices are closed and locked.

On Friday, town officials announced all after-hours events at Parks & Recreation, the W.J. Barefoot Auditorium, Lee Street Gymnasium, Town Hall Conference Center facilities, and Singing Grove will be postponed or canceled for 30 days. The Benson Museum is also closed for the next 30 days, as is the Mary Duncan Public Library.

Dunn

Mayor William Elmore signed a proclamation Monday, declaring a state of emergency in Dunn, effective at noon and to last until the order is rescinded or modified.

“On March 13, 2020, President Donald Trump declared a National Emergency and the first case was confirmed in Harnett County,” the mayor noted in his proclamation. “Declaring a state of emergency is necessary to allow for sufficient personnel and resources to maintain order and protect public health, safety and welfare and to secure property in the city of Dunn.”

The declaration orders city staff to work with county, state and federal agencies “for the orderly protection, treatment and rehabilitation of affected persons; and to provide for cooperation and coordination of activities relating to emergency mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.”

Johnston County

According to a statement from the Johnston County Board of Commissioners Chairman Ted Godwin, the order became effective at 8 a.m. Monday morning. Godwin said the declaration is necessary to position the county to receive needed aid from state and federal resources.

“I have today initiated a proclamation for a state of emergency in Johnston County primarily because of procedural and logistical requirements for expedited assistance from state and federal agencies,” Godwin said in the statement. “Our team feels that this declaration will strategically position our local emergency management personnel to receive necessary equipment and supplies more quickly.”

There are currently two cases of COVID-19 in Johnston County, according to county officials. The two cases involve people in the same household and are two of the over 30 cases currently reported statewide.

“Our board members, along with all elected leaders in Johnston County, consider the health and well-being of our citizens to be our top priority,” Godwin said. “Johnston County citizens have always pulled together in difficult times. I feel confident that with diligence, good faith and open communications, we can weather this crisis as well.”

Angier

In its declaration, Angier town officials, which include Mayor Bob Smith and Town Manager Gerry Vincent, the town urged residents to avoid large meetings as much as possible and to limit visits to town offices.

“By declaring a state of emergency for the town of Angier we are urging residents from attending any large gatherings,” the statement said. “We are also encouraging anyone that has business with the town to limit face-to-face contact with staff, therefore we are urging our residents to pay their water bills online, by phone or utilizing our drop box.”

The town is also urging local organizations to follow similar guidelines.

“We are encouraging all local organizations that are planning large group activities to either postpone them to a later date or cancel them,” the statement said. “This is not limited just to civic clubs and organizations, but also restaurants, grocery stores and churches.”

In addition to requesting bills be paid remotely, the town announced all recreational activities sponsored by the parks and recreation department are canceled until further notice.

Town officials also said town hall will continue with normal business hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday, but the library will be operating on shorter hours. It will be open Monday through Friday from 9 to 11 a.m. and from 3 to 5 p.m. and the Depot will be closed until further notice.

Cumberland County

Cumberland County Board of Commissioners Chairman Marshall Faircloth Monday, March 16, declared a state of emergency in response to COVID-19. There are currently no presumptive or confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 in Cumberland County.

“Although we do not have a positive case of the infection right now in Cumberland County, we are preparing for that day and this is a proactive measure to ensure we have the flexibility and resources needed,” Faircloth said during a press conference. The declaration will activate the county’s Emergency Operations Center for as long as required and authorize the county to take appropriate action to protect the public welfare.

“This may mean alterations in county services and programs. We will keep the public updated on any changes though the COVID-19 webpage on our website at co.cumberland.nc.us and our social media platforms,” Faircloth said.

What it means

Under a state of emergency, access to state and federal assistance is made easier and, in the case of the Johnston County order, it outlines and fights price gouging.

The Johnston County order said gouging is punishable by a fine of up to $500 per incident and 30 days in jail, and each sale shall constitute a separate offense.

Gov. Roy Cooper has requested a major disaster declaration for the state of North Carolina due to the continuing impacts of COVID-19 on North Carolina.

“It’s important that we help North Carolinians stay protected from the health impacts of COVID-19 and recover economically from the financial impacts this crisis is having on our state,” Cooper said in a letter to President Trump.

In requesting the major disaster declaration, Governor Cooper asked the federal government to provide individual assistance for those affected, including crisis counseling, disaster unemployment assistance and Small Business Administration assistance, among other programs.

Governor Cooper issued a state of emergency for North Carolina to respond to the Coronavirus COVID-19 crisis on March 10. President Trump followed by declaring a national emergency on March 13, opening Public Assistance for North Carolina, which reimburses government offices and non-profits for actions that protect public health and safety. Eligible counties and communities may qualify for financial reimbursements for the cost of taking prudent actions to reduce the impacts of COVID-19, while also protecting lives and public health.

The State of Emergency is effective as of 5 p.m. and applies to the unincorporated areas of the county, City of Wilmington, and all beach communities.

The State of Emergency states:

Section 4: Beaches.

Access to beaches including, but not limited to, wet and dry public trust strands is prohibited with noncompliance enforceable as a trespass and as otherwise authorized by General Statute 166A. This prohibition does not include boat launches or docks.

Section 5: Prohibitions and Restrictions.

Prohibited gathering is defined as any event or convening that brings together more than ten (10) persons in a single room or single space at the same time, such as an auditorium, stadium, arena, large conference room, meeting hall, theater, or any other confined indoor or outdoor space. This includes parades, fairs, and festivals. A prohibited gathering does not include normal operations at airports, bus and train stations medical facilities, shopping malls and centers or other spaces where more than ten (10) person are gathered.

“The State of Emergency provides consistency across all of New Hanover County and promotes social distancing to help protect us each individually, as well as others,” said New Hanover County Board of Commissioners Chair Julia Olson-Boseman. “We know limiting gatherings and beach access can be inconvenient for our community, but it is an important step to keep our residents safe. We are being proactive so that we don’t have to close other facilities or important services in our community, and we need people to take this order seriously. The more we can do now to limit the spread of this virus, the better.”

Bridges are still open, and businesses on the islands will continue to operate, abiding by the current Governor’s orders. Only public access to the beach strands is prohibited at this time. Residents are encouraged to support local businesses by using online services, purchasing gift cards and ordering takeout or delivery.

The county will also close public restrooms at all county parks until further notice. This is due to the higher level and frequency of cleaning and sanitation recommended for high volume public restrooms to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The county’s parks and gardens remain open, but visitors cannot congregate in groups of more than 10 and must maintain a distance of six feet from one another.

To prevent the spread of COVID-19, residents are encouraged to continue increased prevention measures and practice limited contact with others:

Follow social distancing: gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited, under the State of Emergency, and individuals are encouraged to maintain 6 feet of distance from others.

Wash hands frequently with soap and water, and for at least 20 seconds each time.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact with people who are ill.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze.

Do not reuse tissue after coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are frequently touched (like your phone, tablet, countertops and daily work surfaces).

Stay home and away from others when you are sick.

Board of Commissioners Chairman Jack Bright said the county wants to be proactive and have plans in place and the situation continues to evolve as cases of COVID-19 increase in the United States and North Carolina.

""This is unchartered territory. We don’t have a playbook to go by and have to take it a day at a time and be proactive,"" Bright said after the special meeting held Wednesday afternoon to consider the resolution approving the State of Emergency.

At this time there has been only one positive case of COVID-19 reported in Onslow County but they don’t know what lies ahead as ""dozens"" of other Onslow citizens have pending test results, said County Manager Sharon Russell.

""We have received back (Wednesday) about 10 negative tests but we have dozens of tests from our citizens of Onslow County that are outstanding at this point,"" Russell said. ""We have no way of foreseeing into the future to know if we will get 1 or 2 more new cases or if we could get dozens of new cases over the next few days.""

Russell said the State of Emergency doesn’t set restrictions on citizens but puts in place measures that will allow the county to respond more effectively.

""As this situation has changed we’re trying to be careful and protect the safety and health of our citizens without reacting in a way that causes unnecessary disruption,"" Russell said.

Having the State of Emergency in place will allow the county to seek grants and reimbursement from the federal government for eligible expenses related to the response to coronavirus pandemic, such as overtime for county employees and additional supplies that may be needed for first responders and various other employees for protective and other gear.

Emergency Services Director Norman Bryson noted after the meeting that the call center opened to answer questions from citizens is open 12 hours a day and requires 9 hours of overtime each day to keep the call center manned by county employees.

As of the time of the special meeting, 19 counties had at least one confirmed positive case of COVID-19. Of those, Onslow County was one of four that had not yet adopted a State of Emergency, Russell said.

With adoption of the resolution, Onslow County’s declaration of a State of Emergency applies to the unincorporated area of Onslow County.

North Carolina,Robeson,43900.98333,https://www.robesonian.com/news/132699/robeson-gets-coronavirus-testing-kits-cooper-declares-emergency,Robeson gets coronavirus testing kits; Cooper declares emergency,"Cooper Cooper Smith Smith

LUMBERTON — The Robeson County Department of Health announced it has coronavirus test kits on Tuesday, the same day the governor declared a state of emergency related to the new virus.

“Each health department in North Carolina was allowed three kits for testing through the state lab,” said Bill Smith, county Health Department director.

Only people who have been in direct contact with a person known to be infected with COVID-19 or are exhibiting symptoms of the virus, and flu has been ruled out, will be tested, Smith said. Commercial labs, such as Lab Corps, are available for private use.

“As tests become more available, I would expect testing parameters to loosen,” Smith said.

Gov. Roy Cooper’s emergency declaration activates the Emergency Operations Center to help agencies coordinate virus response activities from one location and to make it easier to buy needed medical supplies, protect consumers from price gouging, and increase county health departments’ access to state funds.

“The health and safety of North Carolinians is our top priority,” Cooper said. “We are taking the necessary steps to ensure that North Carolina is prepared and responding to this virus, and this order helps us do that. Though we are still in the early stages in North Carolina, time is a valuable resource and we must work together to slow the spread while we can.”

The order has key provisions similar to those enacted in the wake of a natural disaster. The order will help with the costs associated with combating the disease and help make available supplies that may be difficult for health-care providers and public health agencies to get because of increased demand. It also increases the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Service’s role in supporting local health departments, which have been tasked with monitoring quarantines, tracing exposure and administering testing.

“The emergency declaration really just helps focus on the issue,” Smith said. “It did not put any restrictions in place, but rather reinforced actions to counter the spread of the virus and limit exposure to the vulnerable population.”

The activation of the Emergency Operations Center will help with communication among agencies involved in fighting the virus’ spread, he said.

“What it does not do is have the state issue decrees of no mass gatherings, no sporting events, no church activities, etc. — things that Italy has done because the virus is so pervasive,” Smith said. “If we don’t get it under control, that could be the next step.”

Some states with fewer COVID-19 cases have issued similar emergency declarations, Smith said.

“The governor seems to be of the adage ‘better safe than sorry,’ which is in keeping with pronouncements made early during adverse weather storms,” Smith said.

Also on Tuesday, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services issued recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 and reduce the number of people infected. The recommendations come in the wake of the state health department confirming on Monday five new cases of COVID-19 in Wake County, bringing the statewide total to seven.

There are no cases of COVID-19 in Robeson County, according to Smith.

“We understand these actions will have a significant impact on the lives of people in our communities,” a Department of Health and Human Services press release reads in part. “NCDHHS is making these recommendations based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, current actions by other states, and the most up-to-date epidemiologic information we have to protect the public’s health.”

The Department of Health and Human Services recommends people at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 should avoid large groups of people as much as possible. This includes gatherings, such as concert venues, conventions, church services, sporting events, and crowded social events. People at high risk should also avoid cruise travel and non-essential air travel.

People at high risk include anyone more than 65 years of age, or having an underlying health condition, such as heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes, or a weakened immune system.

All facilities that serve as residential establishments for high-risk people are urged to restrict visitors. These establishments include nursing homes, independent and assisted living facilities, correctional facilities, and facilities that care for medically vulnerable children.

The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that event organizers urge anyone who is sick to not attend, encourage people who are at high risk to not attend, adopt lenient refund policies for people who are high risk, find ways to give people more physical space so as to limit close contact as much as possible, encourage attendees to wash hands frequently, and to clean surfaces with standard cleaners.

All travelers returning from countries and U.S. states affected by COVID-19 are urged to follow Department of Health and Human Services guidance on self-monitoring: https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina/coronavirus.

The Department of Health and Human Services is not recommending the pre-emptive closure of schools and childcare centers at this time.

The recommendations should begin immediately and extend through March 31, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Smith favors the recommendations because they, for the most part, are designed to protect the vulnerable, older population.

“It also recognizes that a person coming from a state, say Washington, may be as much of a risk as Italy, Japan or such,” he said. “There is a special emphasis on restricting visitors around facility-bound individuals which is keeping with restrictions put in place at the height of the flu season.

“It should be noted that industries, county and city governments, school boards or any employer can be more restrictive than state guidelines.”

The CDC reported Tuesday there are more than 110,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide. There are 647 cases in the United States and there have been 25 deaths, according to the CDC. Cases have been confirmed in 35 states and in Washington, D.C.

A North Carolina Division of Public Health report issued Tuesday put the number of global cases at 113,702 and the number deaths around the world at 4,012.

Debate rages among health officials, physicians and researchers about how contagious and deadly the new coronavirus is. Most say this is because too little is known about the disease that came out of Wuhan, China, and was first reported to the World Health Organization in late December.

In particular, estimates of the virus’ mortality rate vary widely. The World Health Organization reported Friday the mortality rate could be between 3% and 4%. The same WHO report said that estimate was based on the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases.

Some researchers, in particular a group in the United Kingdom, say the morality rate could be 2% or lower because some cases, particularly mild cases, are not reported. Some researchers believe between five and 40 coronavirus cases in 1,000 will result in death, with a best guess of nine in 1,000, or about 1%.

Some researchers and public health officials agree that death from COVID-19 will depend greatly on the infected person’s age, sex, general health and the health system available to the person.

Surry County is now under a state of emergency as county leaders look for ways to keep their coronavirus numbers down. The county is one of the North Carolina counties without a confirmed case of the coronavirus. The county manager said the state of emergency doesn't mean travel will be restricted in or out of the county. The state of emergency basically gives any town in the county more power to receive more resources and be reimbursed later from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Some examples would be fuel or items in the home you might need. ""It’s not a typical situation. I don’t have a playbook for this. We’ve had to be patient in what we do when making decisions and we’ve had to change those decisions on the fly,"" County Manager, Chris Knopf said.The Surry County Health Department is now monitoring the latest updates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as this situation evolves. Samantha Ange, the county health director, said there is so much false information online right now. She wants people to know that North Carolina Health and Human Services and the CDC have updates daily. ""I think that going through a pandemic will definitely stay in all of our minds throughout our lifetime. But if we do, we know how to better react. I think we'll tell our children about this one day,"" Ange said. While Surry County has no confirmed cases now, leaders are trying to learn from other counties or towns to figure out the best move to make next.",state_of_emergency,73050

We encourage you to support our efforts to keep the public informed by subscribing at https://www.transylvaniatimes.com/subscribe.

Transylvania County has just declared, at roughly 1:30 p.m., Friday, an ""official State of Emergency.""

The following comes from Commission Board Chairman Mike Hawkins: Today I am declaring an official State of Emergency for Transylvania County. It is important to understand what that means and, just as importantly, what that doesn't mean.

A State of Emergency is a tool which gives government some flexibility in responding to unusual circumstances. I believe this is merited in our current COVID-19 response execution, due to the complexity of the response planning which is taking place.

In declaring a State of Emergency, Transylvania County joins 67 other North Carolina counties, along with the Federal and State governments. All those entities decided this action was a prudent part of their COVID-19 response planning.

This action is also coming with the assent of the City of Brevard and town of Rosman.

These are important points to understand. There is no reason for additional concern on behalf of our citizens. This is a case of adding an additional tool in our toolbox, should it be needed.

On behalf of the Transylvania County Board of Commissioners and the dedicated staff of Transylvania County government, thank you for your response to this challenge. The outpouring of initiatives from the government, business, non-profit and faith communities has been inspirational. We have no doubt the bonds we are building will remain long afer COVID-19 disappears.

Thank you for all that you do.",state_of_emergency,32903

In addition, Commissioners have given Watson approval to offer two weeks of extended paid leave to specifically over situations related to COVID-19. Those situations may include personal sickness or care of a sick family member. With the evolving crisis regarding COVID-19, management will continue to evaluate whether temporary changes to staffing levels or operations are necessary.”",state_of_emergency,212756

The county’s move falls short of ordering residents to shelter-in-place, but officials in Raleigh and other towns hinted Sunday that level of restriction may be coming.

“We don’t want to overreact, but we want to stay on top of things,” Wake Commissioner James West said Sunday. “We possibly could have to take on more restrictions because there’s just so many unknown factors in terms of the spread. ... We don’t want to create panic.”

The county’s declaration makes the following mandatory:

▪ Mass gatherings are limited to 50 people, whether in theaters, meeting halls, auditoriums or any other indoor spaces. Many types of businesses are excluded, including grocery and hardware stores, gas stations, hotels and day cares.

▪ Fitness clubs, gyms, salons, tattoo parlors and spas are closed. Restaurants may remain open for delivery and carry-out.

“None of these decisions is easy,” County Manager David Ellis said. “The risk of keeping non-essential business open is too great.”

▪ The use of playground equipment, both public and private, is prohibited. Open space around parks and greenways can remain open.

“We want people to use our greenways, our trails, to get that fresh air,” county Director of Human Services Regina Petteway said. “That’s good for their mental health.”

▪ Nursing home and assisted living visits are limited to adults who show identification, and all must show identification and be screened for signs of COVID-19. Visits are confined to residents’ rooms and limited to one person a day.

▪ The county is urging businesses to start respiratory and temperature screening for employees and to prohibit people with fevers higher than 100.4 from entering. Businesses are also encouraged to screen clients.

Some towns, including Cary and Morrisville, have also declared an emergency state, but the Board of Commissioners’ Sunday declaration makes the restrictions uniform countywide.

Ellis said police and sheriff’s deputies will enforce the new restrictions but the details, including whether tickets will be issued, is up to individual cities and towns.

Wake County Emergency Operations Center Director Darshan Patel said stricter rules such as shelter-in-place is “a tool in the toolbox” that could kick in if the county sees continued spread of the virus. But for now the idea is to give enhanced social distancing time to work.

The state DHHS reported 255 positive tests for coronavirus Sunday morning, rising from 184 on Saturday. Testing has increased to 6,438 people, up from 5,276 Saturday.

The News & Observer has compiled a separate tally based on reporting from both the state and individual counties. By Sunday afternoon, the total cases had reached 298, of which 49 are in Wake County.",state_of_emergency,1072203

RALEIGH — The county that includes North Carolina's capital on Sunday announced strict prohibitions on gatherings and movement that are more restrictive than the statewide orders already in place to blunt the spread of the new coronavirus.

Wake County, the state's second-largest county by population, said all hair and nail salons, spas, gyms and fitness centers and tattoo parlors must close starting Monday.

Assemblies of 50 or more people must be canceled, although the ban doesn't apply to retailers such as grocery and hardware stores and banks, as well as hospitals.

The state government's count of more than 250 COVID-19 cases as of Sunday morning includes about 40 from Wake County. The statewide count grew by 70 compared to Saturday.

""This is a challenging time, and it requires us to make difficult decisions to keep Wake County residents safe,"" Wake commissioner Chairman Greg Ford said in a release about the order, which lasts until April 30. Mecklenburg County, the state's largest county, already has its own supplemental restrictions. The state counted 66 positive cases in Mecklenburg.

While Gov. Roy Cooper's current executive order makes gatherings of more than 100 people a criminal violation, state health officials have urged residents to comply with lower thresholds. Cooper also has prohibited dining-in at restaurants and bars.

Playground equipment in public and private parks in Wake County can't be used, according to the county's emergency order, which also recommends retailers screen employees and customers for illness before they enter.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The number of completed tests in North Carolina at public and private labs, now over 6,400, has doubled since Friday. No virus-related deaths in the state have been reported.

Worldwide, more than 329,000 people have been infected and more than 14,600 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University.",None,1072203

(NewsDakota.com) – The City of Valley City and Barnes County passed a resolution declaring an emergency in response to the COVID-19 virus.

Valley City Mayor Dave Carlsrud talked about the importance of declaring the emergency and the precautionary steps everyone should take during this health emergency.

City Attorney Carl Martineck said the city commission decided to close access to city hall to protect staff members from contracting the virus. He also talked about a new directive from the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office concerning public meetings during this health emergency.

Barnes County Officials continue to monitor the COVID-19 activity, and Barnes County Departments have been undergoing efforts to mitigate activity through employee education, and reviewing continuity of services. An Emergency Declaration allows for utilization of the County’s emergency reserve fund to assist with expenditures related to this health emergency.

Tuesday a judge set their new bond at $5 million each.

A jury found Madison West and Chase Swanson guilty of conspiracy to commit murder by either intentionally or knowingly causing the death of another human being in the killing of 23-year-old Nicholas Johnson from Rhame, N.D after an eight-day trial in early 2018.

The duo appealed their case to the Supreme Court this year. Justices reversed and remanded the case and it’s headed back to the drawing board.

An opinion written by Justice Jon Jensen in July says conspiracy to knowingly commit murder is a non-cognizable offense, because it allows an individual to be convicted of the offense without an intent to cause the death of another human being.

As for West’s case, justices say West failed to object to the jury instructions and they reviewed it “for obvious error.”

Judge James Gion’s court reporter, Tyler Culver, said the judge set a bond of $5 million in cash for each defendant.

The Bowman County Clerk of Courts office says new documentation on the case hadn’t been filed as of noon Tuesday. The court server shows new charges in the death of Johnson haven’t been posted. Your News Leader reached out to the State’s Attorney’s office but hasn’t heard back yet.

The three-member commission unanimously approved the request at a meeting Wednesday morning.

The pump station in Emmons County will allow Energy Transfer to double the capacity of the Dakota Access Pipeline from 570,000 barrels of oil per day to about 1.1 million barrels.

In a statement released following the commission’s decision, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe expressed disappointment. “The PSC is required to consider what the doubling of the flow of oil in an existing pipeline would have on North Dakota family farms and ranches, and North Dakota citizens’ health and safety,” the statement reads.

“Today, the PSC failed to do its job for the people of North Dakota,” it continues.

Plans to expand the pipeline’s production have drawn pushback from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which worries about the possible environmental impacts of oil spills.

North Dakota,LaMoure,,https://www.jamestownsun.com/news/weather/4722753-LaMoure-County-declares-flood-emergency,LaMoure County declares flood emergency,"LaMoure County and the city of LaMoure declared flood emergencies on Tuesday, Oct. 15, due to the possibility of high water releases from Jamestown and Pipestem dams. The declaration comes after Jamestown Mayor Dwaine Heinrich issued an emergency declaration during a special City Council meeting on Monday, Oct. 14.

""There are potential agricultural impacts but there are also other impacts that could affect both the county and the city of LaMoure,"" said Kimberly Robbins, LaMoure County emergency manager. ""The best case scenario, the releases decrease. The worst case scenario, we see again what we went through last spring.""

Water levels of the James River in the city of LaMoure were at 15.9 feet on April 4 of this year due to ice jams and high tributary flows.

As of 1:15 p.m. on Oct. 15, the gauge of the James River in the city of LaMoure was 11.8 feet. According to the LaMoure County website, the average level is 7 to 8 feet, with the action stage being at 12 feet. Flood stage is 14 feet, a moderate flood stage is 16 feet and a major flood stage is 18 feet.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is releasing 1,000 cubic feet per second from Jamestown Dam and 800 cfs from Pipestem Dam as of Monday for a combined flow of 1,800 cfs, said Jerry Bergquist, Stutsman County emergency manager.

listen live watch live

Bergquist said the 1,800 cfs being released from the two dams is the highest it has been since 2011, when releases were a combined 2,400 cfs.

Robbins said it takes between five and seven days for water released from Pipestem and Jamestown dams to reach LaMoure. Bergquist said since mid-September, Pipestem and Jamestown reservoirs have experienced a high volume of water in both river systems from high precipitation.

""I don't know if I have any (expectations) yet,"" Bergquist said. ""Based on everything we know now it isn't anything different than what we knew about it yesterday.""

A public information meeting is scheduled for Wednesday at City Hall in Jamestown, where representatives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, National Weather Service, city of Jamestown and Stutsman County Emergency Management are among those expected to attend.

Bergquist said the meeting could reveal what the next step for both counties is.

""We’re putting together a plan to do some minimal sandbagging in some parts of town where we know elevation is low,"" Bergquist said. ""If we don’t end up using the (sandbagging) operation that would be the best news in the world, but we’d at least be prepared for it if we did need to use it.”

Robbins said LaMoure County will be installing a new gauge in the river to measure the flow and elevation of the water. The gauge will be near Adrian, about 30 miles northwest of the city of LaMoure, where a second gauge is located.

""The county website is being updated with flood information constantly,"" Robbins said. ""Hopefully our residents will be informed of what flood stages we will be entering going forward.""

Bergquist said time is going to be very valuable moving forward.

“We're trying to be as proactive as we can,"" Berquist said. ""We know they're going to want to release as much water as possible before the freeze-up.”



Bergquist also said saturated soils combining with no frost on the ground could be a potential problem for people living close to the river.

""People that are close to the river may be experiencing higher water tables,"" Bergquist said. ""Some (sump) pumps might be kicking in and starting to work, but others might not. There's no better time to check your sump pumps.""

Sump pumps are commonly found in basements where homes are at or below the water table and work to pump groundwater outside of the home automatically, Bergquist said. If the water level is high enough and the pumps aren't working, people can start to see flooding in their basement.

""Seriously, it is a great time to check your pumps,"" Bergquist said. ""It is a very wise thing to do just to check and make sure.""

Bergquist said LaMoure may be the only town ""highly impacted"" by unregulated tributaries adding to the two rivers flowing south from Jamestown.

""LaMoure is affected more than anywhere,"" Bergquist said. ""There could easily be homes along the river where the water might be getting closer. I don't know of any hot spots in particular except for the city of LaMoure.""

Bergquist said northern parts of South Dakota could see increases in water levels up until the James River connects with the Missouri River.

""When you get into South Dakota, there gets to be a lot of issues there as well,"" Bergquist said. ""The river has a tendency to spread out quite a bit. Maybe even a half mile or more.""

Batavia, Ohio – The Board of Commissioners today declared a State of Emergency in Clermont County in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The action came in a room reconfigured to achieve social distancing to help prevent the spread of the virus. Those who had business to conduct with the board waited in a conference room with a video feed and came into the session individually to speak.

“Extraordinary times require extraordinary action,” said David Painter, president of the Board of County Commissioners. Commissioners Ed Humphrey and Claire Corcoran concurred.

The emergency declaration, along with a previous resolution delegating disaster functions in event of an absence of a quorum of the Board, spells out succession of leadership and the authority of the County Administrator in an emergency. It exempts from the competitive bidding process purchases related to the emergency that are greater than $50,000 but less than $100,000, so long as no fewer than three informal estimates are obtained.

The County Administrator is authorized to “take those actions that are necessary and appropriate, including the delegation of administrative and departmental functions among “responsible staff” to assure proper implementation in exercising this authority,” the resolution states. The County Administrator also will “report to the Board of Commissioners on any actions taken pursuant to this resolution.”

In addition to the emergency declaration, the Commissioners suspended Monday meetings (except March 23) into the future as well as suspended public participation.

In the absence of a quorum of the County Commissioners, authority is designated to the County Administrator. In the absence of the County Administrator, the President of the Board may delegate to the Assistant County Administrator or Budget Director.

The resolution also activates the Clermont County Emergency Operations Center for the duration of the emergency in order to coordinate response efforts.

Pam Haverkos, the county’s Emergency Management Agency director, said the declaration would allow the county to obtain state funds in the future if needed.

In addition to the emergency declaration, the Commissioners suspended Monday meetings (except March 23) into the future as well as suspended public participation.

“Through the leadership of Clermont County Public Health and the Clermont County Emergency Management Agency, we’re collaborating with first responders, hospitals, the business community and others to navigate these challenging times,” Painter said. “Our goal is to protect the health of our employees and those they serve. We seek to slow the spread of this highly contagious disease, while continuing to carry forth the essential operations of government.”

Full statement by Commissioner Painter: Extraordinary times require extraordinary actions. I commend each and every one of you for the steps you have taken during this challenging time. It’s inspiring to see people coming together and following the advice of health experts so we don’t overwhelm our health system. People are practicing “social distancing,” as recommended by the experts, so they don’t get infected by this highly contagious disease and pass it on to the elderly and those with chronic health conditions. You’re checking on each other and supporting each other. You’re doing what it takes. You’ve taken steps to protect the public and our employees. I see resilient and innovative people rallying and doing their best at a challenging time. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Clermont County government has made a number of changes in delivery of services. Some of the actions include closing waiting rooms, delaying court hearings, providing services online and getting payments via drop boxes and mail. We are in constant contact with our department heads and elected officials and will provide updates as they become available. We’re continually updating the list, available at www.clermontcountyohio.gov. The list includes specifics about what waiting rooms are closed and alternative ways of doing business with Clermont County government. You’ll see a number of online opportunities for applying for services and new ways to mail or drop off documents. These moves were taken in response to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization, the Ohio Department of Health and our own Clermont County Public Health. Through the leadership of Clermont County Public Health and the Clermont County Emergency Management Agency, we’re collaborating with first responders, hospitals, the business community and others to navigate these challenging times. Our goal is to protect the health of our employees and those they serve. We seek to slow the spread of this highly contagious disease, while continuing to carry forth the essential operations of government. If history concludes that we have defaulted to a position of increased safety that wasn’t warranted, we can live with that. One thing we can’t live with is knowing that we didn’t act when we had the chance and that lack of action resulted in you or your family being hurt. This is a difficult for everyone. Please be patient and understand that everyone here at Clermont County has your safety at heart even when some decisions might make life difficult for a short duration. If you can, limit your social distance from others, protect your children, wash your hands, keep your hands below your face when possible, and help others that need your help. Together we have weathered storms, droughts, floods, tornadoes, power losses, and we will rise to this challenge and overcome. We are Clermont County. May God bless you and your families.",state_of_emergency,200218
Ohio,Clinton,43903.66181,https://www.wnewsj.com/news/132835/clinton-county-health-district-no-case-of-coronavirus-here-president-declares-national-emergency,Clinton County Health District: NO case of coronavirus here; President declares national emergency,"WILMINGTON — As of mid-afternoon Friday, there were six Ohio counties with confirmed cases of COVID-19.

According to Renee Quallen with the Clinton County Health District, who was authorized to speak on behalf of the Clinton County health commissioner, Clinton County is not one of those counties with a confirmed case, contrary to a rumor.

As of 3:30 p.m. Friday, there were 13 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ohio, with 159 persons “under investigation” (tested but awaiting results), according to the Ohio Department of Health website.

President Donald Trump announced Friday afternoon that he is declaring the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency, as Washington struggles with providing Americans with relief and officials race to slow the spread of the outbreak.

Speaking from the Rose Garden, Trump said, “I am officially declaring a national emergency.” He said the emergency would open up $50 billion for state and local governments to respond to the outbreak, according to the Associated Press.

Trump said he was also giving Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar emergency authorities to waive federal regulations and laws to give doctors and hospitals “flexibility” in treating patients.

Trump spoke as negotiations continue between the White House and Congress on an aid package, but there was no announcement of a breakthrough, as House Democrats prepare to vote on their own measure Friday.

“This is a work in progress. We are working as fast as we can to put the support systems into place that need to be there,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Friday. “You can’t write laws to cover every situation. People need to take some responsibility, and we’re seeing it happen. People are getting it.”

DeWine also said Friday afternoon, “Daycares: We are not closing them at this pint, but it could happen in the future. Parents using daycares should start thinking about what their alternatives could be.”

The declaration was issued through an executive order hours after Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said he would issue a similar proclamation of civil emergency.

The county order gives Budish enhanced powers to respond to the coronavirus. Four cases have been confirmed in Ohio, three in Cuyahoga County and a fourth in Stark County.

Read the executive order in the viewer below.

In the case of an emergency that threatens life, health or property, the County Code allows the executive to make supply purchases up to $500,000 and enter into contracts or leases without going through the normal approval processes or requiring competitive bidding.

The executive order also restricts all non-essential travel for county employees, and all other out-of-state or international travel would be subject to approval by the executive on a case-by-case basis.

In addition to the executive order, county custodians are working over time to sanitize public spaces in all county-owned buildings, and the county will pay for additional cleaning services to sanitize public spaces in leased facilities, a spokeswoman said.

The County Code requires Budish to “immediately send a report to County Council and post the report on the county’s website, describing the nature of the emergency, the actions taken, and the estimated cost and sources of funding for the actions taken.”",state_of_emergency,1263154

Ohio, Louisiana, Delaware, and Philadelphia — home to roughly 18.8 million people — were the latest states and cities to order residents to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. On Sunday, the three states' governors and the city's mayor announced stricter restrictions, described as ""stay at home"" and ""stay home"" orders, as they attempt to control a rapid spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.

We are now at a new stage. .@DrAmyActon just signed a statewide #StayHome order for Ohioans.

""By doing the #StayHome health order, we can convey the seriousness of this,"" tweeted Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. The Ohio order goes into effect at 11:59 p.m. Monday and will last for at least two weeks, and Philadelphia's begins 8 a.m. Monday. Louisiana's order begins 5 p.m. Monday and will last until at least April 12, while Delaware's will begin 8 a.m. Tuesday.

Today, I am issuing a statewide Stay at Home order that goes into effect at 5 p.m. Monday, March 23, to further fight the spread of COVID-19 in Louisiana, as the number of confirmed cases is now more than 800. #lagov #lalege 📰: https://t.co/wOccTZmd0z

The parameters for the new orders are in line with standards already imposed in other states, including Illinois and California. They also carry the force of law and violations could be charged as crimes.

The orders ban people from gathering in groups and also require businesses to close unless they're deemed essential, such as grocery stores, hospitals, and pharmacies. Restaurants may stay open only to fulfill takeout and delivery orders. Pennsylvania previously ordered the closure of all businesses except those considered ""life-sustaining,"" and Philadelphia's new order on Sunday clarified some of those categories while also ordering people to stay home except to get groceries, care for family members, obtain medical attention, or other essential personal activities. Outdoor activities, like walking or running, are still allowed, as long as people don't congregate in crowds. Governors and local leaders across the US have been pleading with people to comply as cases in almost every state continue to see dramatic upticks in COVID-19 diagnoses. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards retweeted a report that said that his state now has the third-highest number of cases across the US.

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney simplified and amplified the message in a single tweet:

Please stay home. Please stay home. Please stay home. Please stay home. Please stay home.

And in Delaware, Gov. John Carney said he ""issued a stay-at-home order for Delawareans, and ordered non-essential businesses to close at 8 a.m. Tuesday, March 24.""

CORONAVIRUS: Officials say 4 of 17 testing positive for coronavirus in Butler County remain hospitalized

Clemmons wrote that the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, may have an impact on the city's ability to operate effectively. The state of emergency will allow Fairfield to suspend some of the city's provisions and processes, which also could include City Council approvals. Provisions and processes could include, but not limited to purchasing policies, competitive bidding, processing of benefits and payment of vendors.

Fairfield City Council held its regularly scheduled meeting on Monday, March 23, 2020, at the municipal building. Council members and key staff attended the meeting, and practiced social distancing guidelines outlined mandated by the state. Though the public was able to attend, no community members attended. Pictured is Councilwoman Leslie Besl.

""We need to ensure that the city is able to provide continuity of services throughout this crisis,"" said City Manager Mark Wendling of the recommendation of the state of emergency declaration.

Additionally, Wendling told Council, “In light of the current crisis, I recommend that raises be deferred until we have a better idea of the overall impact of the COVID-19 crisis.”

The recommendation came as Council considered a salary ordinance to establish pay ranges for ""certain exempt and salaried employees,"" though the legislation did not directly provide raises to employees.

Other COVID-19 impacts in Fairfield

Though the COVID-19 has canceled the Community Arts Center programming, most of the city's parks are open, though not all amenities will be accessible to the public, said Councilwoman Leslie Besl, chair of council's Parks, Recreation and Environmental Committee.

""Our parks are still accessible, with the exception of the dog park, but the playgrounds are closed,"" she said.

Besl said the parks department is also ""looking at ways to connect with our residents"" with virtual events.

Virtual events could include a Facebook Live event, or a printable scavenger hunt for families to participate in as they are in their neighborhoods.

Council members and key city staff were the only ones to attend the meeting, though it was open to the public.

Mayor Steve Miller said the city made accommodations to adhere to guidelines and orders issued by Gov. Mike DeWine and state public health director Dr. Amy Acton.

""I think it's still important to have the meeting. A lot of people are still going to work, a lot of people in the city building are still working, and I think council should also go to work,"" Miller said.

The planned City Council work session scheduled ahead of the Monday's regular meeting was canceled.

Ohio,Gallia,43906.95486,https://www.mydailytribune.com/top-stories/51203/gallia-declares-state-of-emergency,Gallia declares state of emergency,"GALLIPOLIS — Gallia Commissioners voted unanimously Sunday during an emergency meeting in the Gallia 911 Communications Center to declare a state of emergency for Gallia County due to the Ohio COVID-19 outbreak.

The commissioners have declared states of emergency before, especially during extreme incidents of flooding. The declaration allows the county to potentially access state and federal funding in response to crisis situations.

Department heads present were Gallia Sheriff Matt Champlin, Gallia Health Commissioner Dr. Gerald Vallee, Gallia 911 and Emergency Management Agency Director Sherry Daines, Gallia Emergency Management Agency Associate Director and Gallia Firefighter’s Association Representative Tim Miller and Gallia EMS Director Keith Wilson.

“At this time, we do not have any positive (COVID-19 cases) in Gallia County,” said Gallia Public Health Official Tyler Schweickart. “They’re (the state) is basically looking at all public gatherings at this point (for restriction), restaurants and bars… At this point we have the vast majority of events taken care of as far as cancellation of those. Churches are still ongoing at this point… We have reached out to other gathering points… The processes that we have right now in public health are still in the containment (phase)… It’s inevitable we’ll be moving to the mitigation side. Our goal at the health department is to make sure we don’t overwhelm our hospital partners. As of right now, the health department’s primary function with this is assisting the hospital to make sure we can take as much off their plate as possible when we’re still in the containment phase.”

Schweickart said that the health department is advising church-goers to avoid handshakes or acts of fellowship that might put them in close contact with individuals potentially carrying COVID-19.

The health department has been screening individuals as much as possible and sending individuals who meet the Center for Disease Control parameters to medical care.

Vallee urged those who think they may have contracted COVID-19 to contact their primary care physicians or call ahead to medical facilities before showing up so as to not surprise and overload healthcare institutions.

“We need to keep communication going and I think down the road as we’ve established our (emergency operations center), we’ll meet daily to discuss as a group,” said Commissioner Harold Montgomery.

“We declare Gallia County in a state of emergency in regard to this COVID-19 virus,” said Montgomery. “The general purpose is for us to stay in front of this and to be working together with our state agencies. As the state and the federal agencies have already declared (a state of emergency), this will allow Gallia to try and draw some resources.”

“As I’ve watched this evolve over the last really four weeks,” said Commissioner David Smith, “my position is or my opinion is, and I hope I’m wrong, it’s only a matter of time before it comes to Gallia County. I wish I could tell you how (the situation) is going to evolve. This is truly a first time event…We live in a world that travels everywhere and we are starting to see what happens there… It’s going to be a challenge to contain this as best we can.”

Montgomery County commissioners also decided to revise and update the county’s leave policies to give workers additional time off with the goal of helping slow the spread of COVID-19.

But in Warren County, its commission voted 2-1 against an emergency declaration.

Montgomery County needs to take precautions to protect its employees and the citizens it serves during this crisis to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, said Commission President Judy Dodge.

“Taking this step is necessary and will allow us to obtain resources and support we need to address this pandemic from both the state and federal government,” Dodge said.

Greene County officials meet to plan for isolation or quarantine orders

Montgomery and Greene counties passed emergency declarations on Tuesday, following in the footsteps of the state of Ohio and other jurisdictions including the city of Dayton.

Montgomery County’s resolution formalizes the county’s emergency status and the decision to exercise emergency authority provides more flexibility related to staffing and procurement procedures, Dodge said.

Montgomery County began transitioning to emergency operations on Monday to focus resources on “mission critical” services, and the county’s leadership team has reduced staffing levels in non-essential areas, Dodge said.

Officials say the county is taking significant steps to try to deliver essential government services while also following recommended social distancing practices.

“As a result, some normal day-to-day functions and services will not be available because these are not normal times,” Dodge said.

Montgomery County has implemented a flexible leave policy for all of its thousands of employees that included adding two weeks, or 80 hours, of special vacation time so non-essential workers can stay home during this risky period, said Montgomery County Commissioner Debbie Lieberman.

The county will be limiting and freezing non-essential programs and services, stopping all non-essential spending and enacting a hiring freeze in an effort to protect the public and public employees, Liberman said.

Essential personnel will report to work or will work remotely when possible, Lieberman said, and essential services like food stamp and unemployment benefits will still be available, though citizens are encouraged to apply for benefits online to limit physical contact at the Jobs Center.

The county encourages citizens when possible to call and send emails to access needed services and utilize online platforms and payment drop boxes.

The Greene County Commission also passed a resolution Tuesday morning declaring an emergency in the county.

“It allows us to secure state and federal reimbursement funds if/ when they become available,” read a statement from the Greene County commissioners. “It suspends the requirement for competitive bidding and allows us to ensure faster procurement of needed supplies and services. … We continue to hope for the best outcome while planning for the worst case scenarios.”

Melissa Howell, Greene County health commissioner, said the county has responded to small and large health concerns including the opiate crisis, west Nile virus, Ebola and other devastating events like tornadoes. Howell said the county knows how to work well together.

“No one is immune,” Howell said. “For individuals with no symptoms, there would be no test needed. For individuals with mild cold-like symptoms no test would be needed. Individuals with severe illness cough, shortness of breath and fever may be tested.”

Howell said county preparations began when the first reports of the virus came from China.

Warren County commissioners Dave Young and Tom Grossmann voted no, while insisting they were ready to provide more funding to fire and emergency management workers needing equipment when dealing with potential cases.

Grossmann and Young suggested declaring the emergency would cause residents to panic. They noted federal and state states of emergency had already been declared.

Bruce McGary, the county prosecutor advising them, indicated he had found no legal basis for the need for the county declaration.

Commissioner Shannon Jones said the vote on a resolution sought by local emergency management and health officials was advisable and unlikely to create additional panic in the county.

During a 90-minute work session, the commissioners heard appeals from a handful of emergency management officials to declare the emergency to support a change in standard of care to eliminate the transport of residents to be tested for COVID-19 with no other medical problem.

RELATED: Montgomery County to declare emergency: What it means

The officials also said the emergency declaration would also put the county emergency response agencies in line to get more masks and other equipment needed to respond to calls.

“No one is saying this isn’t serious,” Young said. “When we declare a state of emergency, that means something.”

Young and Grossmann emphasized they want to support needed changes, once the legal support has been provided.

During the meeting, Franklin Fire Chief Jonathan Westendorf said Atrium Medical Center in Warren County dealt with a a COVID-19 case last week.

“Atrium Medical Center and other Premier Health hospitals currently have no admitted patients with confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Late last week, a person came to Atrium Medical Center to be tested for COVID-19. This person returned home and went into self-quarantine. We have learned that this person did test positive for the virus. The patient is recovering at home. Staff took appropriate precautions as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention when testing this person, and therefore CDC guidelines do not recommend that the staff be isolated or quarantined,” according to a statement issued by Jennifer Burcham, site manager, PR and Community Relations, at Atrium.

Ohio,Greene,,https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/greene-officials-meet-plan-for-isolation-quarantine-orders/RcFSkfKM3eL1shcuieU4mL/,Greene County officials meet to plan for isolation or quarantine orders,"The Greene County Board of Health called an emergency meeting Saturday to put in place a plan if it becomes necessary to enforce quarantine or isolation measures.

The board signed a resolution declaring a public health emergency in the county and allowing the board to enforce a Limitations on Movement, Isolation and Quarantine order, if the spread of coronavirus, or COVID-19, deemed it necessary.

Documents from the Ohio Attorney General’s Office were signed to reinstate quarantine and isolation orders that have been in place for at least 50 years, said Melissa Howell, county health commissioner. As early as the 1950s, the same orders were used to help guide the decision making when isolating or quarantining someone with a communal disease like typhoid or tuberculosis.

How to get expert answers to your coronavirus questions

Although no one in Greene County has tested positive for coronavirus, Howell explained the orders might need to be enforced if an individual who had coronavirus, or came in contact with someone who had it, refused to voluntarily comply to isolation or quarantine.

“Once they go home, we ask them and the hospitals ask them, to keep themselves at home if they’re in that time period where they could still spread the illness,” Howell said. “But if that person chose not to stay at home, then we could issue those isolation orders. If it were someone who was exposed to a case, then that would be where we would issue quarantine orders.”

Most people follow the orders voluntarily, however if necessary, the board could appoint a person to enforce the orders.

White House steps up safeguards as Trump awaits test results

“Law enforcement already has the authority to act based on Dr. Acton’s orders if they believe somebody is spreading illness around,” Howell said. But typically we would just perhaps deputize our own sanitarian, or just a person to watch and make sure someone is staying in isolation and quarantine during the time where they might be transmitting disease or going into the community.”

Although the policies on how to handle individuals in isolation and quarantine are decided on by the board are all adopted at a local level, Howell said she expects other surrounding counties to have similar plans.

“When we are developing them, we develop them together lots of times so you’re going to see very similar actions taken everywhere,” Howell said.

The board considers the county’s risk as still relatively low.

Coronavirus: 26 cases confirmed in Ohio, officials discuss mental health amid pandemic

“We believe the risk is low,” Howell said. “So far we have no cases, anyone that’s been tested from Greene County, as we speak right now, has tested negative. But those numbers are rapidly changing and we believe that there is community spread so it’s just a matter of time before we get our first case.”

Saturday’s meeting was held as Governor Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton held a press conference to discuss updates on the coronavirus and share the state’s response to the virus.

There are now 26 cases in Ohio and 264 people are under investigation for coronavirus the Ohio Department of Health reported.

Hamilton County commissioners declared a state of emergency today as they prepare for the coronavirus pandemic to spread.

""We want to make sure people understand that this is serious,"" said Board of Commissioners President Denise Driehaus. ""This is a health threat in the community. I believe this is a prudent response at the right time.""

This follows the actions of Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who on Wednesday declared a state of emergency for the city, and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who declared a state of emergency for Ohio on Monday.

The county's state of emergency doesn't give commissioners power to cancel events, said spokeswoman Bridget Doherty.

But it does allow the county to get reimbursement from the federal government on any expenses related to the pandemic. It also allows the county to make purchases without having to go through competitive bidding.

For instance, if the company that provides food to the jail can no longer due so due to coronavirus, the county can find another food vendor without having to bid it out, she said.

The declaration also gives commissioners the power to establish the joint information center, which would serve as a base of operations for emergency responders, if that becomes necessary.

As of now, there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Hamilton County. But people could be walking around spreading it and not know they have it, said Greg Kesterman, interim health commissioner for the Hamilton County Public Health.

The health department is monitoring potential cases in Hamilton County but won't say how many.

About 80% of COVID-19 cases involve mild symptoms that mimic a cold. But for the elderly and people with immune deficiencies, the disease can kill.

Kesterman asked anyone who is feeling ill to stay home, no matter how minor the symptoms.

""Even if you think you have the cold, now is the time to take that precaution,"" Kesterman said. ""We don't want you to make other people sick.""

Kesterman said the state and county have enough COVID-19 tests to meet demand. There have been 82 tests for COVID-19 statewide with enough tests available now for 600-800 people.

He recommended anyone who suspects they have COVID-19 to contact their primary care physician or, if they don't have a primary care physician, an urgent care facility. He said to contact them first by phone so the medical staff can prepare and safely test without risking getting anyone ill.

The physician will then order a test if needed, he said. The samples are sent to a state lab for testing.

County officials urged the public not to panic. Hamilton County Emergency Management Director Nick Crossley said they're asking people to have two weeks worth of food, medicine and water and not gather in large groups.

""It's all pre-emptive,"" Crossley said. ""We can show you the research that if we don't these large gatherings, we can contain this. We anticipate this being a short time.""

Here is how to do it and how it can help curb the COVID-19 pandemic. USA TODAY

MARION — A statewide ban on mass gatherings due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has forced the cancellation and postponement of thousands of events across Ohio.

On Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency because of the pandemic and said he will make $50 billion available to fight the outbreak.

As of press time Friday, there were 13 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Ohio, according to the ODH website. ODH reports that 159 people are under investigation and 333 people are under health supervision.

Marion Health Commissioner Traci Kinsler said Friday afternoon that there are no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Marion County. She said Marion Public Health continues to monitor the situation locally.

Professional, college, and high school athletic events, school plays and music competitions, concerts, job fairs, and a wide range of other activities have been canceled in the wake of the order, which prohibits gatherings of 100 or more people in the same indoor space.

Gov. Mike DeWine and Ohio Department of Health (ODH) Director Dr. Amy Acton issued the order during a press conference held Thursday in Columbus.

Like all other communities across the state, Marion County is experiencing the effects of the temporary ban.

City of Marion response

The City of Marion announced in a press release Friday afternoon that the Marion Senior Center will be closed ""effective immediately until April 13.""

""The Senior Center Transportation, Homemaker services, and Lifecare Alliance Home Meal delivery will operate as normal until further notice,"" the release reads. ""The monthly Food Box distribution will continue as usual, but the pickup/distribution point will be located outdoors at the Senior Center.""

Marion Area Transit will remain open for ""normal business,"" according to the press release. Officials said there could be delays in service due to city workers disinfecting the buses throughout the day.

Mayor Scott Schertzer has recommended that all meetings of boards and commissions under his appointment be canceled until April 13. Additionally, city employees are being encouraged to limit face-to-face meetings and ""employee travel to non-essential conferences and/or meetings outside the City of Marion will not be permitted through April 13.""

According to the press release, ""City buildings have had high-touch points disinfected with remaining areas set for disinfection in the coming days. Disinfection will continue on an on-going basis following protocols that are in place.""

Coliseum events canceled

According to a post on the Marion County Fair's Facebook page, all events scheduled at Veterans Memorial Coliseum have been canceled.

The post reads, ""Due to the governor's order regarding the COVID-19 virus, events at the Veteran's Memorial Coliseum are cancelled until further notice. Stay safe and healthy! We'll see you when this all clears.""

Director Cindy Wood was not available for comment on Friday.

Events lost due to the governor's order include this weekend's VEX Robotics State Championship for elementary and middle school students; the OH-WAY Wrestling tournaments planned for March 20-22 and March 27-28; the National Robotics Challenge set for April 2-4; and the Champion Force Athletics Cheerleading Challenge scheduled for April 25.

""The thing we're worrying about is the loss of revenue to our local businesses and how this might impact our community,"" said Matt Carbary, president of the Marion Area Chamber of Commerce. ""It's a combination of understanding the need to keep our community safe and how we can support our local businesses.""

Mark Holbrook, executive director of the Marion Area Convention and Visitors Bureau, said local hotels and restaurants will experience a negative impact due to the cancellations.

""The main priority is safety and health, but the health of our community also depends on a thriving economy,"" he said. ""When we have things that impact it, we have to take a look at how we're going to react and deal with the situation. The hotels are going to be hit the hardest, because they don't only rely on visitors to Marion, but also on stop-overs for people who are traveling. Being on a major route, we have a lot of stop-over traffic, but that's going to be reduced as well.""

Palace Theatre schedule altered

Palace Theatre Executive Director Bev Ford said the governor's temporary ban on mass gatherings has caused the cancellation or postponement of several events at the downtown venue.

Pleasant High School and Elgin High School have both postponed their spring musicals. Ford said she is working with both schools to reschedule the plays. Pleasant's production of ""Mary Poppins: The Broadway Musical"" was planned for this weekend. Elgin's performance of ""Into the Woods"" was scheduled for the weekend of March 20-22.

""In addition to the schools, we have seen a number of other organizations also cancel rental events,"" Ford said. ""Because March is historically high school rentals, the Palace doesn't program our own events; therefore, there are no theater sponsored events that are being impacted over the next couple of weeks. Our classes, through the Academy of the Arts, will continue because enrollment is well under the 100 person mass meeting limit, and we are fortunately able to provide the recommended six feet (of) spacing for participants.""

Ford said theater officials will continue to monitor orders from the governor's office and ODH. She said the upcoming Palace schedule includes a film to be shown March 27-29, the stage production of ""Nunsense II: The Second Act"" on April 3-4, and a concert with pop singer Amy Grant on April 18.

""We are holding steady and will respond accordingly once we know how this unfolds,"" Ford said.

Ford said the theater is adjusting its box office hours due to the rental cancellations. For the next two weeks, the box office will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, but will be closed Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.

She said tickets for upcoming shows can still be purchased via the theater website marionpalace.org.

YMCA is open, limits services

Marion Family YMCA Executive Director Theresa Lubke said the facility will remain open to the public, but is canceling all classes and programs effective Saturday, March 14 through Saturday, March 31.

Child Watch and Y Preschool are included in the cancellation notice. The sauna and steam rooms will also be closed.

According to letter from Lubke, guest passes will not be sold or accepted for entry and guests will not be allowed to use the facility March 14-31. Members will not be allowed to bring guests.

Lubke noted that YMCA staff is ""taking steps to keep our facility as clean as possible.""

""These steps include adding custodial hours, prioritizing cleaning time to disinfecting commonly used surfaces, keeping some doors open reducing need to touch door handles, additional cleaning of exercise equipment, and more frequent disinfecting of our Kids Gym and other areas of the facility,"" she stated. ""In addition, we have added hand sanitizer stations and are reminding our members through signage and email to stay home when sick, to clean fitness equipment after use, and to cover coughs and sneezes.

""We also encourage everyone to make a personal decision with their health care provider about taking the risk of exposure that exists when visiting a public setting. This is especially important for Marion’s older adults.""

Lubke said YMCA members should check the organization's Facebook page for updates.

Ohio,Monroe,43909,https://www.mcbeacon.com/news/monroe-county-declares-public-health-emergency,Monroe County declares a Public Health Emergency,"In less than a week, Ohio went from preparing for COVID-19 to seemingly complete lockdown.

Schools are closed. Restaurants and bars are take-out only.

Following the lead of Governor Mike DeWine, the Monroe County Commissioners declared a Public Health Emergency in the county Monday, March 16 during their regular meeting.

The declaration came upon the recommendation of the Monroe County Health Department, citing the more than 1,600 cases of COVID-19 in the country, including a daily-growing number in Ohio.

As part of the measure, the commissioners agreed to close the Monroe County Courthouse to the public starting Tuesday, March 16.

The emergency measures will remain in effect until the emergency no longer exists.

Each county department is responsible for maintaining its day-to-day operations during the courthouse closure and emergency.

A locked door and a list of phone numbers for each county office will meet visitors to the Monroe County Courthouse.

The challenge for each department head is to continue offering necessary services while being closed to the public.

Monroe County Sheriff Charles Black has stopped offering web checks and CCW for the time being. There will be no face-to-face visitation for inmates.

Much like the courthouse, the Sheriff’s Office will be locked.

“You’ll only be allowed into our office if it is a necessity” Black said. “My main concern is the 100 inmates we have out there (and our officers).”

Black will not take any new out-of-county prisoners for the next few weeks until the crisis subsides.

County courts will limit cases over the next few weeks.

County Court Judge Jason Yoss will use Skype for as many hearings as he can while limiting in-person interaction to the “most essential cases.”

Yoss offered the use of his courtroom to Common Pleas Court Judge Julie Selmon and Probate and Juvenile Court Judge James W. Peters to help keep people from walking through the courthouse.

Monroe County Clerk of Courts Beth Ann Rose recommended visitors phone ahead, and her staff would attempt to walk residents through handling their needs online if possible.

If a visitor needed assistance, Rose said her staff could potentially meet visitors in the alley near the entrance to the courthouse.

Monroe County Treasurer Taylor Abbott will place the deposit box up at the courthouse and permit other county offices to use the box for payments and legal documents.

Abbott hopes residents will choose to make their payments online. He offered to waive credit card charges during the courthouse closure.

Other county offices not located at the courthouse are also closing to the public. Those offices include the Monroe County Engineer’s Office, Monroe County EMA and Monroe County Job and Family Services (JFS).

The front door at the Monroe County Senior Center will be locked, which is also where the Monroe County Health Department is located.

In each case, the offices will continue to be staffed. Visitors are encouraged to call each agency.

Monroe County JFS recommends any individual needing to do business with the agency for SNAP, OWF, Medicaid or PRC call 1-844-640-OHIO, Option 2 from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Individuals will need to visit benefits.ohio.gov to apply or check on the status of their public assistance. PRC applications are available at the JFS page on monroecountyohio.com.

For job search activities and unemployment, individuals may visit ohiomeansjobs.com for job links. A claim can be filed at www.unemployment.ohio.gov or by calling 1-877-644-6562.

Child and adult protective services staff will remain accessible during the closure to the public. Staff may be reached at 740-472-1602, Option 5 during regular business hours, 7 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or 740-213-5794 after hours.

One county department that will remain active for the time being is Monroe County Public Transportation (MCPT).

Denise Potts, MCPT director, stressed her concern for her staff during the health emergency, but due to MCPT’s contract, it is required to continue operation.

Monroe County Prosecuting Attorney James L. Peters said any decision to limit service would have to come from the state level, which has not been given at this time.",state_of_emergency,14585

Health Dept. recommends ‘social distancing,’ Center for Seniors makes cancellations","ZANESVILLE, Ohio – With a fourth case of coronavirus in Ohio announced Wednesday, local agencies are taking precautions.

Around 3:30 p.m., the Muskingum County Health Department and the Muskingum County Center for Seniors held a press conference in response to the virus.

Today, #Ohio has a 4th confirmed case of #COVID19. The individual is a man, mid-50s, in Stark County. He has no travel history outside the US, which means we have a case of “community spread.” — Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) March 11, 2020

The health department is urging people to avoid large social gatherings and practice social distancing. Dr. Jack Butterfield says this is not a time to panic but there are precautions people can make.

“There is now a fourth case of Coronavirus in Ohio. The significance of this case is it was a community spread infection. Which means this is a confirmed case of COVID-19 in a patient who has no travel history and no known exposure to another patient with COVID-19. So, that means in Ohio it is spreading in the community. We knew this was coming, today is the day that it has arrived. That also makes it a game changing day because of community spread, We have to give much more attention to the potential for this disease to spread in what we call mass gatherings,” Butterfield said.

Dr. Butterfield says the Health Department has advised the Muskingum County Center for Seniors regarding the virus.

Executive Director Anna Combs for the Muskingum County Center for Seniors is cancelling all activities at their three locations until further notice starting Thursday. They will also not be serving meals at the centers but will offer them to-go.

Combs says everyone in the community should look after seniors in the community.

“During this time, it is imperative that we pull together as a community. Our seniors have families and friends. If there’s someone in your church that you think might be vulnerable I encourage you [to] please pick up the phone, reach out to that senior and make sure that they’re okay. I ask you to keep in mind those seniors as we face this together as a community. That we pull together, ask what their needs are and try to be there to serve that need.”

On Wednesday, Governor DeWine ordered limitations for nursing home and assisted living visitors.

NURSING HOMES/ASSISTED LIVING

We are issuing an order limiting visitors to one per day per resident. There must be a single point of entry – and everyone will be screened for temperature/potential illness. Visitor logs must be kept. — Governor Mike DeWine (@GovMikeDeWine) March 11, 2020

Schools in grades K-12 are not closing at this time, according to Dr. Butterfield.

Ohio,Portage,43910,https://www.record-courier.com/news/20200320/portage-county-declares-state-of-emergency,Portage County declares state of emergency,"Portage County Commissioners declared a state of emergency related to COVID-19, even as they live-streamed Thursday’s meeting because of concerns about the spread of coronavirus.



Ryan Shackelford, director of the Portage County Emergency Management Agency, said the proclamation demonstrates that the county is enacting its emergency plan and procedures, as well as its operations center, and is doing as much as possible to alleviate the emergency.



""It also acknowledges that the incident is potentially bigger than what we can handle individually and that the need for regional and state assistance may be forthcoming,"" he said. ""It essentially eases restrictions from seeking assistance from state and federal partners, which is similarly the reason for the state and federal declaration.""



The declaration says that the virus is ""rapidly spreading"" and ""the resulting impact of the disease on Portage County residents and businesses is potentially catastrophic."" It calls on citizens to comply with ""necessary emergency measures.""



As of Friday’s update from Gov. Mike DeWine, Portage County was not among the 28 counties impacted by the illness. A total of 169 individuals had a confirmed case of COVID-19, with 39 of those people hospitalized. The disease has claimed the life of a patient from Lucas County.



DeWine proclaimed a state of emergency on March 9.



The proclamation was approved as commissioners live-streamed Thursday’s meeting for the first time, asking the public to stay away. Those who attended were given information on how to find the internet broadcast, and the start of the meeting was delayed by an hour so residents could go home and access the meeting online. The live-steam link for commissioners’ meetings is available on the commissioner’s page at the county website, www.co.portage.oh.us.



Portage County Commissioner Sabrina Christian-Bennett voted against temporarily changing the format of the meetings during the outbreak. She said Brian Ames, who records commissioners meetings and streams them on YouTube, was upset about being excluded from the meeting, and that not enough notice of Thursday’s change was given.



""I was not part of this decision,"" she said.



Assistant Prosecutor Chris Meduri told commissioners that although meetings must be open to the public, Ohio’s law on public meetings does not require the public to be able to speak at those meetings.



Commissioners later discussed the possibility of eventually closing the administration building to the public, and urged department heads to work from home and have their employees do the same. Some said they still had to work from county buildings, but were limiting the number of people who came to the office. For now, the building remains open to the public, but people are being asked to do as much business as possible by phone or email.



Commissioner Kathleen Clyde mentioned the possibility of conducting meetings via video conferencing, which would allow elected officials to stay home, while still providing a broadcast of the meeting to the public.



""I think in light of this crisis, we need to do what we can to protect the public and ourselves,"" she said.

Ohio,Portage,43902,https://www.record-courier.com/news/20200312/portage-superintendents-prepare-for-school-closures-following-governors-orders,Portage superintendents prepare for school closures following governor's orders,"With the closure of K-12 schools and the banning of gatherings of more than 100 people, Ohio is quickly grinding to a halt as the coronavirus spreads throughout the state.



In the meantime, Portage County superintendents are working with their administration teams to determine how to best continue educating and feeding their students during a three-week, state-mandated closure of all K-12 schools.



During a press conference on Thursday, Gov. Mike DeWine ordered all schools to close for an extended-three week spring break that starts at the end of the day on Monday and ends April 3 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. The closures do not include child care facilities.



""We thought long and hard about that, and we understand the sacrifice this is going to entail, but this is the best medical advice we can get from people who study viruses,"" DeWine said.



State Superintendent Paola DeMaria was scheduled to speak with educators on a conference call late Thursday afternoon to provide detail and clarity following the school-closing order. While classes are currently set to resume April 3, local districts will decide exactly how to proceed.



Some districts, including Field and Aurora, had already announced announced days off for students to give the staff in-service time to develop plans for potential extended closures and most districts had begun canceling or postponing large-scale events.



Field had already canceled Monday classes to allow the staff to prepare for potential closures, and now with the governor’s orders, their students’ last day is Friday. Field Superintendent David Heflinger notified families that because their spring break begins (April 6-10) as the mandated closures end, they would be off until at least April 13.



""We will provide learning opportunities for our students. Directions will be sent to families next week. We are providing these opportunities to keep students engaged. While we do not know what the State of Ohio will expect in regards to making up time, we will do everything possible to end the school year on the date expected, June 4, 2020,"" Heflinger wrote.



Waterloo Superintendent Shawn Braman said that school would be canceled for students on Friday, March 13 to allow teachers to plan and develop assignments during the closure. Monday, March 16 would be a regular school day at Waterloo and students will be sent home with school work packets. Because spring break was set last year and because it is contractually obligated, Waterloo will still have spring break April 10-17, which falls after the mandated closure.



Braman said that while plans have not been finalized, he has been in discussions with their food supervisor and the two are trying to figure out how to continue to provide meals to students. ""That’s a bigger concern for us than academics,"" he said.



A message on the Ravenna School District’s website said school will be held Friday and Monday. Parents will be notified about the learning plan by the end of the day Monday.



Windham Superintendent Aireane Curtis said that Windham would make Friday and Monday regular open days for students and staff.



""We are still figuring out details of what this will look like for three weeks,"" she said.



Rootstown Superintendent Andrew Hawkins said that Rootstown would continue regular school days on Friday and Monday. Rootstown’s administrative team is meeting Friday morning to determine how education will continue over the next three weeks and how they can continue to feed students. Hawkins expect that he will share the district’s plans related to food and education by Monday.



""I think we’ll be getting more guidance for the government, but we want to continue to educate our kids. We’re doing a technology survey right now and we may do a combination of online learning and assignment packets. Whatever we do, we want to make sure it’s meaningful,"" he said.



Streetsboro has canceled school starting Friday. In an email to families, Superintendent Michael Daulbaugh said that students can pick up medications from school clinics between 8 a.m. and noon on Friday and can pick up school materials between 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Streetsboro staff will report to school at 8 a.m., and will spend the day developing 10 days worth of lessons and activities to help students maintain their learning.



At Thursday’s board meeting, Daulbaugh said that those activities would vary based on grade, rigor and subject. If students do not have internet access the district will give them time to work on assignments once they return. Online lessons will be available on the district’s website or through Google classroom beginning next week, and Daulbaugh said he would notify families when those lessons are available. It is expected that students complete these activities until school resumes.



Daulbaugh added that they are working to reschedule the high school band trip to Disney for a future date this school year.



""This situation is very fluid and more information will be provided as it becomes available. The Streetsboro City School District will continue to follow the guidance provided by the Ohio Department of Health, Portage County Health Department, and the Governor’s office. Thank you for your cooperation during this difficult time. It is critical that we do not panic, make good decisions for your families, and most importantly stay safe,"" Daulbaugh wrote.



Crestwood Schools will also be closed to students starting on Friday, and all athletic practices and events are canceled. The buildings will remain open and wholly staffed on Friday if students need to pick up items, including medicine, Superintendent David Toth said.



""Our instruction will continue non-traditionally during this time, except during our Spring Break from March 23 through March 30, by an online platform. Younger students or students that do not have internet access will be provided hard copies. These hard copies will be available in the main offices of each school on Monday to pick up. On Friday, more information will be forthcoming on this topic. Lessons that are in hard copy form and medicine, after Monday, will be able to be picked up at the board office,"" Toth wrote to Crestwood families.



Southeast is also closed to students starting on Friday, and staff will spend the day planning remote education. Superintendent Robert Dunn said that next week, March 16-20 would likely be spent planning remote education and allowing students time to pick up supplies, and that remote instruction would likely begin March 23.



""I believe we’d be in a hybrid situation where we’re using some online learning and potentially a mixture of some type of grab and go learning, like a blizzard bag,"" Dunn said.



He said that while the governor has mandated schools close through April 6, ""we have to think beyond that. We’ll put together short term and long term objectives.""



He added that he is aware that some families rely on the district to provide meals and said ""We’re exploring options to help feed our kids.""



Southeast’s spring break is scheduled for April 10-17, which falls after the mandated closure. Dunn said he would be working with the staff to determine if they would still observe that spring break, or perhaps have a shortened version of it.



Aurora is open on Friday for students and staff, but will not have class on Monday and will not return until April 6 at the earliest.



""The buses will run at our normal times tomorrow. We will have a typical school day, but will also use this time for students to collect their belongings and to secure the necessary technology devices for learning during our break. There will be no online learning or expectation of students completing work during the first two weeks of this break,"" Superintendent Pat Ciccantelli wrote to the Aurora community.



""Our goal will be to provide alternative learning opportunities beginning the week of March 30. We will communicate the details regarding this alternative instruction schedule through our FinalForms emails and each teacher will communicate information via their typical learning platforms or parent communication program.""



Mogadore Local Schools Superintendent John Knapp said Friday and Monday are teachers-only days in Mogadore. The day will be used for in preparation for three weeks outside the classroom, two of which are still instructional weeks.



The district then will be closed through the end of the day April 3, returning to class April 6, tentatively.



""As we understand the order at this time, our players and performers can continue with practices and rehearsals,"" said Knapp.



When they come into work Friday and Monday, teachers will prepare hard copy packets for students to work on with additional online resources referenced in them, Knapp explained.



State testing for the district was scheduled for the week of April 6, but that is up in the air now, given DeWine’s announcement. Some of the work teachers will likely assemble will be review work that would have been presented in class were it in session.



Parents should pay attention to all-calls and districtwide text messages for specific information about when to pick up packets, he added.



Fifth case of coronavirus in Ohio diagnosed



Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton signed an order Thursday banning gatherings of more than 100 people, the governor said. The ban does not include grocery stores, restaurants and bars, forms of transit, athletic events that exclude spectators, weddings, funerals or religious gatherings, DeWine said.



DeWine on Tuesday asked for event organizers and sporting events to limit spectators. Since then the NBA, NHL, MLS and Major League Baseball have postponed their seasons.



DeWine said that in the next few days the state will issue regulations to stop all visitation at nursing homes and state psychiatric hospitals. People who work at nursing homes and psychiatric hospitals will have their temperatures tested.



""This will not last forever ... Everything we’re doing is temporary,"" DeWine said. ""We will get back to normal in Ohio.""



A fifth Ohioan tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday. He is a 55-year-old man from Trumbull County. The man has been hospitalized in an intensive care unit and did not go to work after developing symptoms, DeWine said.



The five cases are expected to double within six days, DeWine said.



""We know that these confirmed numbers are just a small fraction of the individuals who are infected already in the state of Ohio,"" DeWine said.



The state received two additional testing kits for the virus, bringing its capacity to test up to 1,200 people, Acton said.



There are 52 Ohioans awaiting test results for COVID-19. There are 30 Ohioans who have tested negative so far, according to the state Health Department’s website.



The two latest confirmed cases of the virus represent ""community spread,"" officials said. That means a person who had not been traveling abroad was infected by someone else within the U.S.



Acton said the COVID-19 outbreak is expected to peak by late April or mid-May.



Until then, Ohioans will have a few tough months ahead of them, she said.



""Every action every one of us takes is going to save lives,"" Acton said.

WARREN, Ohio (WKBN) – Trumbull County Commissioners declared a “State of Emergency” in the county due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The declaration was made Saturday morning during a special Board of Commissioners meeting. As part of that declaration, departments under the board’s jurisdiction are staggering work shifts and maximizing remote work access in order to “promote the health and safety of employees and the public.”

Employees under their control are to work remotely if possible.

Those unable to work remotely will operate under staggered shifts.

Departments that are affected by these changes include the Trumbull County Department of Job and Family Services and the Child Support Agency.

All employees in “essential services” will remain on regular schedules.

Commissioner Frank Fuda says the public needs to do its part to stop the spread of the virus.

“I’m also asking the public to do their part. Our public has to realize, this is a combined effort. They have to try to stay in as much as possible,” Fuda said.

Thursday, a State of Emergency was also declared in Mercer County, Pennsylvania. The same day, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to close.",state_of_emergency,206442

The board voted on the declaration Monday in a unique session where members of the general public and the news media could listen to the proceedings online and ask questions but they did not attend in person.

Among other things, the declaration reads, “All citizens are called upon and directed to comply with the necessary emergency measures, to cooperate with public officials in executing emergency operational plans and comply with the lawful direction of properly identified officials.”

The declaration take affect immediately and will last for 30 days, unless renewed by a majority of the board of commissioners.

The declaration came at the request of Tuscarawas County Health Commissioner Katie Seward and Alex McCarthy, director of the Tuscarawas County Homeland Security & Emergency Management Agency. It also has support from the cities of Dover, New Philadelphia and Uhrichsville and the Tuscarawas County Sheriff’s Office.

Commissioners said the declaration will make it easier for the county to receive state and federal funding.

Commissioner Chris Abbuhl said it shows that the board is taking a unified approach with the Tuscarawas County Health Department and the county EMA to deal with the crisis.

The three commissioners took turns praising the efforts of Seward, McCarthy, the sheriff’s office, county school superintendents, area hospitals and the Salvation Army during this situation.

“We are in perilous times here and we don't know what's going to happen next, but we do know that our best decisions are educated ones,” Commissioner Al Landis said. “Working as a team, I think we're going to make the right decisions.”

For the near future, commissioners will only meet on Wednesday, instead of twice a week as they normally do. All meetings will be conducted online, as all county office buildings are closed to the public because of coronavirus.",state_of_emergency,92672

The county said the declaration is a precautionary measure. The decision to make the declaration was made “to be as prepared as possible to address the potential of future coronavirus (COVID-19) incidents in Clackamas County.”

The declaration allows the county to streamline resources and staffing, establish emergency policies, and seek additional resources from the state, the county posted on its website.

The county said a state of emergency is different from a public health emergency.

“The residents of Clackamas County are encouraged to follow standard hygiene protocols and stay at home when ill, otherwise go on with daily life,” the county said in its declaration.

A person who works at a Lake Oswego elementary school is presumed to have COVID-19 after testing positive last week. While the person works in Clackamas County, they live in Washington County.

Many people don't seem concerned about social distancing or the impact the crowds could have on the people who live there. As a result, Seaside declared a state of emergency Saturday and the mayor of Warrenton issued a 24-hour notice for visitors to vacate campgrounds, state parks, vacation rentals and hotels.

""Hordes of people were coming down to the city and to the region in general. It was a clear and present issue and we had to act. So we moved forward to vacate all the campgrounds except for employees and camp hosts,"" said Warrenton Mayor Henry Balensifer.

The City of Manzanita also ordered all visitors to leave town within 24 hours and return home under the authority of the city's state of emergency declaration.

The city wrote: ""On behalf of our citizens, business owners and our community who depend on the few resources we have, we request civil cooperation.""

Astoria Mayor Bruce Jones posted a video Sunday, announcing that under its state of emergency declaration city council approved a ban on vacation and leisure travelers in hotels and short-term rentals. Medical patients and essential workers are still allowed.

Neighboring Seaside went a step further Sunday evening. It ordered hotels and short-term rentals to shut down and restricted access to all public buildings and parks, streams and beaches that run parallel to city limits starting Monday. The city was able to do so under its new emergency declaration, which went into effect Saturday.

RELATED: Seaside Oregon residents start petition to call State of Emergency

Seaside beach areas run from the Cove in the south to the edge of the estuary separating Seaside and Gearhart to the north.

Seaside ordered these restrictions in conjunction with Clatsop County. After declaring an emergency this week, Clatsop County Board of Commissioners took a drastic step on Sunday.

They banned camping in unincorporated areas of the county and within incorporated areas not under another emergency declaration; closed short-term rentals, homestay lodging and hotels; and closed pools, spas and other public bathing areas. The order begins at noon on March 23 and will last two weeks.

Under the county's order, hotels are closed except to anyone currently there with reservations longer than 30 days or who has reservations related to work. Campground staff, hosts, and people working in Clatsop County on a temporary basis are exempt from the order.

“With these measures, Seaside and Clatsop County take mutual steps to protect all of the citizens in our community on the North Coast,” Seaside Mayor Jay Barber.

Tillamook County announced Sunday morning it would effectively close outdoor recreation to. It closed all privately-owned, county, state and federal parks parks to day use and overnight camping. It is also closing access to beaches and boat launches (except to commercial fishermen) beginning Monday and lasting through April 28.

Tillamook is closing all hotels, motels, bed & breakfasts and short-term rentals to anyone not providing essential services or in the county for commercial purposes.

The county board of commissioners said in a statement:

""COVID-19 represents [an] unprecedented threat to public health the likes of which has not been seen in the past 100 years. The severity of the threat to life, health and safety calls for extreme measures and immediate action. We care deeply about the economic resilience of our lodging providers and businesses in the tourism sector and are grateful for their sacrifices for the protection of their employees, guests and the community at large.""

Oregon coast resident Audrey Bige went outside to document the large crowds.

""It was almost infuriating that people would have such disregard for not only themselves but other people,"" Bige said.

Lincoln City, Cannon Beach and Manzanita have all been crowded with people all weekend, prompting concerns for the lack of social distancing.

One Manzanita resident said it was as packed as the 4th of July and said there needs to be a crackdown. ""Four weeks would help flatten the curve,"" they said.

The coast has limited healthcare resources and people who live there worry what could happen.

""These people were coming in, flooding our stores, supplies were starting to get scarce to start with, and our supply chain is a little different than say Portland, where all the warehouses are about 10 miles down the road,"" Balensifer said. ""Our supplies come from quite a distance because ... we have two main roads, Highway 30, Highway 26. An accident happens on one and that whole thing kind of shuts down for a while.""

Balensifer also pointed to the fact that there are only two hospitals there so they don't have the capacity to care for a surge of people. If a shelter in place order does happen, he doesn't want visitors sheltering in place there. He said visitors are also hoarding goods there because they could not find them in Portland.

Residents in Seaside started a petition asking for the city to take proactive measures and limit spring break activities.

Coastal mayors spoke with Oregon Gov. Kate Brown on a conference call Sunday afternoon.

As of now, the governor is only asking people to stay home. There has been no official order.

In a tweet Sunday, Brown wrote, ""On Friday night, I asked all Oregonians, on the eve of spring break, to stay home and stay healthy. Unfortunately, our trails and beaches were packed this weekend. I want to be absolutely clear, you are endangering all Oregonians when not following social distancing orders.""

Health officer: 'This disease is going to get worse before it gets better.'

(Update: More from commissioners' meeting, county health director)

BEND, Ore. (KTVZ) -- Deschutes County commissioners officially declared a state of emergency in the county at a special meeting Friday to discuss various aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Commissioners said the emergency declaration is for 60 days, in an effort to provide emergency funds and policies that can better guide the public.

They said they want to make clear that this action is not at adding to any sense of panic, but will open the doors for more funds and support to get ahead of the virus, which has one presumptive case in the county at present.

Dr. George Conway, the county's health services director, recommended the declaration due to the need for supplies and in anticipation of more cases. He said the second, CDC confirmation for the county COVID-19 case should come back within a week and it will no longer be ""presumptive.""

Conway also said the county is monitoring others now, but they are not ""cases,"" only ""persons under monitoring"" due to possible high-risk contact. He said they're not believed to have the virus.

The doctor said there's still no evidence COVID-19 can be transmitted in the air, only by droplets from cougs or sneezes, or someone who touches one on a surface.

""Any time there is a defnable pattern that could help the public, we will share that information,"" Conway told commissioners.

He said an infectious disease nurse has been working with seniors' long-term care facilities in the county since January, putting plans in place and doing proactive training to keep them safe.

Conway said that if the U.S. fails at taking these proactive measures, it will lead to much larger economic catastrophes. Everything people can do to delay the spread also reduces the chances of overwhelming the available resources.

But he also said: ""The disease is going to get worse before it gets better.""

Here's their news release:

Deschutes County Commissioners issue emergency declaration

The Deschutes County Commissioners have issued an emergency declaration in response to COVID-19. The County joins two other Oregon counties that have issued similar declarations.

The emergency declaration authorizes the county to implement emergency actions, access more resources and take appropriate steps to recover some of the costs associated with the County’s response to the disease.

“This emergency declaration will help us to best serve our residents,” said Deschutes County Commission Chair Patti Adair. “We want to be as prepared as possible to help keep our community safe.”

The declaration of emergency comes two days after the Oregon Health Authority announced the first presumptive positive case in a Deschutes County resident.

The Commissioners met Friday to discuss ongoing and emerging COVID-19 related impacts.

During the meeting, Deschutes County Sheriff's Office Emergency Manager Sgt. Nathan Garibay, Health Services Director Dr. George Conway and County legal counsel advised the commissioners that the emergency declaration will help county staff quickly respond and utilize all available resources to best protect the health of our community.

Local public health officials continue to urge residents to wash hands frequently, cover coughs or sneezes and stay home if you show signs of flu or a bad cold, including fever and cough.

DECLARING A LOCAL STATE OF EMERGENCY IN THE CITY OF BEND AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC

Bend City Manager Eric King has declared a local state of emergency as a result of the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has been confirmed in Deschutes County. Governor Kate Brown has declared a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 outbreak in Oregon.

The Bend City Council is scheduled to vote to ratify the declaration, which is in effect through at least April 15, at its meeting Wednesday.

The declaration allows more flexibility and authorization for the City Manager to take actions to help protect the health and safety of the community, through a number of means from limiting access to public places, to buying items or services related to health and safety without normal procurement procedures that can take additional time.

“We need to move fast and be nimble in our responses right now, as this is a rapidly evolving situation,” said Mayor Sally Russell. “This declaration should not inspire concern, but rather, should assure the public that the City is taking every precaution possible to prevent the spread of this virus in our community.”

“My primary focus is to restrict the spread of COVID-19 and to maintain the health of our workforce so employees can continue to provide crucial City services,” said City Manager Eric King. “I have and will continue to develop emergency policies regarding the use of sick leave, vacation leave, telecommuting, meeting protocols, and more, which will be in effect for the duration of the emergency.”

While this emergency is in place, the City will not send shut-off notices or shut off water for non-payment of unpaid water bills and will not allow any permitted special events of more than 250 people.

To eliminate exposure and spread of COVID-19, and in support of state and federal guidelines for social distancing, the City has cancelled all advisory committee meetings and public, project-specific outreach meetings or open houses. City employees are encouraged to telecommute and to conduct meetings through online conferencing tools when possible. Disinfecting and cleaning operations have increased significantly in City facilities.

Currently, scheduled City Council meetings are expected to continue, but with social distancing modifications including increased space between chairs. This results is a smaller capacity in Council Chambers. The City strongly encourages livestreaming the meeting from home through www.bendoregon.gov/councilagenda. Anyone who wishes to communicate with the Council is also welcome to email council@bendoregon.gov.

Bend Police service response to COVID-19:

The City of Bend Police Department recognizes the need to follow State and Federal recommendations related to best practices associated with the spread of, and exposures to, COVID-19. Based on these recommendations we have evaluated and adjusted our services and response to calls for service. These decisions were made to follow social distancing guidelines.

Effective immediately, the City of Bend Police Department will be evaluating calls for service to determine if they can be handled by phone, rather than in person. We also encourage the public to utilize our online reporting portal for appropriate non-emergency crimes. For general police questions we request the public consider calling into our office at (541)322-2960, rather than visiting our police department. The police department will be suspending public finger printing services until further notice.

Future adjustments may be necessary in order to maintain the staff necessary to serve the citizens of our City. Our officers will continue to respond to emergency calls 24 hours a day and 7 days per week.

City of Redmond Responds to COVID-19

Council Considers State of Emergency Declaration

REDMOND, OREGON – On Tuesday, March 17, Redmond City Council will consider a local state of emergency declaration which allows the City to efficiently respond to the evolving public service needs created by the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus).

Examples include: The need to seek additional resources should an outbreak occur in the Police Department which effects staffing; or to seek reimbursement for costs associated with managing the organization; and other unforeseen time sensitive matters that may arise during a rapidly changing situation.

“This authority gives us the ability to respond to unforeseen needs in a calm and thoughtful, yet timely manner,” states Keith Witcosky, Redmond City Manager.

Based on the state’s guidance to reduce the spread of person-to-person transmission of COVID-19, the City has cancelled all public meetings until April 13, 2020. City Council will meet on March 17 and postpone future meetings until April 14, 2020. This timeframe is subject to change as the situation evolves.

Redmond Utility Billing Department encourages residents to practice social distancing and pay their water bill by mail, by phone at 866-506-8162, or online using the following portal: https://cityofredmond.secure.munibilling.com/customers/sign_in.

News release from Crook County Emergency Management:

As novel coronavirus – aka COVID-19 – continues to spread, local health officials have stressed that the risk to Central Oregonians remains low. Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year. Crook County does not currently have any positive cases of COVID-19.

Crook County Emergency Management, with the support of Crook County Court and the City of Prineville, today approved a County Emergency Health Declaration. The local Health Department supports this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the county response to this incident. This declaration will support the need for resources whether that is personnel or supplies. It is consistent with the State Health Emergency Declaration and the National Health Emergency the President announced earlier today.

Crook County and the City of Prineville wants you to know that in partnership with our local and neighboring Health Departments, Law Enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network (COEIN), and medical community, which includes St. Charles Health System, the situation is being monitored very closely and following preparedness plans that are in place for any outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus not only in Oregon but statewide and globally is ongoing.

Crook County Judge, Seth Crawford stated “It is our goal to continue our preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them”.

The leadership of the county and city respect the privacy of the community members and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members. With that being said the safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available.

The joint city and county preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster.

Local Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza - The CDC is recommending non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:

If you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.

Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.

Consult CDC’s travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.

Stay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.

It is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.

This week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people. The city and county strongly believe in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and needs to be followed.

There is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point. It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. The same precautions are suggested for any communicable disease.

Crook County Circuit Court & Jefferson County Circuit Court

The health and safety of all patrons and employees of the Crook & Jefferson County Circuit Courts are of utmost importance to the courts. We are maintaining regular communications with our state and local public health and emergency management professionals to monitor the developing situation with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In partnership with our state and local preparedness partners, we have developed a comprehensive response plan. We are taking all necessary and available measures to maintain a safe and sanitary space for all employees and patrons of our court.

The courts recognize that requiring people to congregate in close proximity for any period of time is now risky. Therefore, effective March 13, 2020, Crook and Jefferson County Circuit Courts have cancelled all jury trials through April 30, 2020, to be rescheduled as conditions allow.

All other court services remain available during normal business hours.

Need DMV service? Visit DMV2U.oregon.gov

March 13, 2020

SALEM – To help slow the spread of Coronavirus in Oregon, the Oregon DMV asks that customers consider using the many services available online rather than visiting a DMV office in person.

You can do these things 24/7 at DMV2U.Oregon.gov:

Renew registration for most vehicles – even if your tags just expired, you can renew online and print the receipt to take in your car as proof of registration.

– even if your tags just expired, you can renew online and print the receipt to take in your car as proof of registration. Update your address – if you move within Oregon, you must report your new address to DMV within 30 days.

– if you move within Oregon, you must report your new address to DMV within 30 days. Report the sale of your vehicle – if you sell your vehicle, you can take an extra step against future parking tickets and towing/storage fees on that car by reporting the sale to DMV online.

– if you sell your vehicle, you can take an extra step against future parking tickets and towing/storage fees on that car by reporting the sale to DMV online. Get a trip permit if your tags are expired or license plates are lost or stolen, or if you’ve just bought a car without current plates.

“We encourage people to avoid renewing their vehicle registration in field offices when nearly everyone can do it via our DMV2U website,” DMV Administrator Tom McClellan said. “Those most vulnerable to the virus – those age 60 and older or who have underlying health conditions – should especially reconsider an in-person visit to DMV at this time.”

Other less frequently used services are also available at DMV2U.

If possible, DMV also asks that customers reschedule drive tests until a later date.

Any time you need a DMV service, please first check at DMV2U.Oregon.gov to see if you can save yourself a trip to an office. You can also visit OregonDMV.com to see office hours, locations and wait times for most DMVs, and to make sure you have everything you need before your visit.

DMV also accepts many transactions through the mail, and our phone agents (503-945-5000) help people prepare for a DMV visit, if required.

If you visit DMV in person

Most of our larger offices station employees near the front door to answer questions, check paperwork, and orient customers to the lobby/counter/testing areas. We are not turning people away who appear sick, but are preparing signage that helps educate customers about COVID-19 symptoms and preventive steps such as good hygiene.

“We are taking additional precautions with cleaning protocols and sanitation of employee/customer high-contact areas,” McClellan said. “If someone stays home from work due to illness, please don’t consider a trip to DMV as an acceptable activity. Stay home and get well, and don’t risk infecting others in public spaces like a DMV office!” said McClellan.

Oregon,Curry,43914,https://www.jacksonville.com/news/20200324/coronavirus-in-jacksonville-mayor-curry-mandates-work-from-home-option,Coronavirus in Jacksonville: Mayor Curry mandates work-from-home option,"Mayor Lenny Curry issued an executive order Monday to allow Jacksonville workers to work from home if they can do their work remotely.

This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. Please support local journalism by subscribing to the Times-Union/jacksonville.com.

The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Northeast Florida rose again Monday to 82, including a spike in Jacksonville over the weekend that brought the number of cases confirmed by state health officials to 50 in Duval County.

Nearly a week into unprecedented restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, Mayor Lenny Curry acknowledged the economic and mental burden placed on residents but said that some people and businesses were taking ""unnecessary risks.""

Curry announced Tuesday that he is expanding the executive order he issued last week that limited attendance at restaurants and non-essential businesses to 50 people to also require businesses to allow any employees who can work from home to do so.

COMPLETE COVERAGE | Coronavirus in Florida

The order will be effective at 8 a.m. Tuesday. City officials said those who do not comply could face fines and citations.

Curry said he even considered enacting a local curfew after hearing reports of large gatherings happening at homes across the city over the weekend but decided not to avoid overwhelming the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, which would have been responsible for enforcing it.

He said state and federal officials could heighten restrictions if the outbreak spiked and began overwhelming local hospitals.

""We're asking you to do the right thing,"" Curry said. ""If you don't do this, and we don't flatten the curve, you could see a federal or state curfew, and they will enforce it.""

The Florida Department of Health has confirmed 1,227 cases around the state, including 82 in Northeast Florida. Five people in the region — three in Duval and two in Clay — have died.

Duval leads Northeast Florida with confirmed cases. The state has confirmed eight cases in Clay, 18 in St. Johns, two in Putnam, three in Baker, and one in Nassau.

Curry has led Jacksonville through three hurricanes since becoming mayor in 2015, and his disaster-time updates with emergency officials at his flank have become a somewhat familiar drill for residents. But in a sign of the times, Curry addressed the public and fielded questions from reporters Monday via an online video conferencing platform that was broadcast by local news stations.

Curry said he understood the economic hardships the restrictions have put on small businesses and the toll its taken on people’s mental health. Bars are closed for the next month, restaurants are only serving take out, and kids are at home indefinitely. Even Jacksonville’s beaches are closed.

Curry said the city is exploring policy measures to offer relief to small businesses. He recommended a few coping mechanisms for people to relieve their stress: Call your friends and family often. Listen to music. Exercise, if possible.

""We have to take care of each other,"" Curry said.

Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday that the state was preparing a field hospital in Jacksonville, one of a few that will be built across the state.

The field hospitals are being established to handle overflow patients in the event local hospitals become overcrowded. The field hospitals are typically handling non-coronavirus patients because patients infected with the virus need intensive-care beds equipped with negative-pressure ventilation that contains airflow in each room.

Curry said efforts to establish a field hospital in Jacksonville are a preparative measure, and that the site will only open if hospitals in the region are overwhelmed.

""This is a preparation and only a preparation,"" Curry said

He said the location of the hospital won’t be released unless it is opened. If opened, the hospital could treat 250 critical-care patients. He said local hospitals have not reached capacity.

City officials have been working with the state to distribute protective medical equipment to local hospitals, said Emergency Management Chief Steve Woodard. He said the city has distributed 3,600 N95 masks, 25,000 surgical masks and 400 packages of hand sanitizer to local healthcare facilities.

Curry said the city-sponsored drive-thru testing site at the Prime Osborne Convention Center has administered roughly 300 tests since opening last week. Duval County residents who want a test must be screened through the Telescope Health mobile application or website.

The tests are given by appointment only, and priority will be given to people with a combination of a fever and respiratory symptoms, travel history on cruises or COVID-19 hotspots or who are healthcare workers or first responders.

The federal testing site at Lot J temporarily closed Monday after reaching its 250-test daily limit. The site will re-open Tuesday at 9 a.m.

Testing at the Lot J location is free, although tests will only be given to people a temperature of 99.6 degrees or higher and respiratory symptoms or healthcare workers and first responders. The site initially limited testing to people 65 years or older, although officials expanded the criteria Sunday to anyone with symptoms of the virus.

As of Monday evening, there have been 579 tests administered in Duval, 272 in St. Johns, 99 in Clay, 24 in Nassau, 18 in Baker and 97 in Putnam, according to the Florida Department of Health’s database. It’s not clear yet if all local testing is included in the database.

The meeting was limited to 25 people, including department heads, members of the media and a few members of the public. Grant County EOC Incident Commander Dave Dobler was appointed temporary Grant County Emergency Management Coordinator. The court declared a county emergency in a motion from County Judge Scott Myers:

“I don’t want to be a county that’s left behind by not declaring. If there are advantages for us to declare an emergency as a county alongside state emergency declarations and federal declarations; I would move that we officially, today at 9:33 a.m., declare a county emergency.”

The motion was passed by commissioners. Find the full county court meeting on video on our My Grant/Harney County Facebook page.

FROM GRANT COUNTY JUSTICE COURT:

Due to COVID-19 health concerns, Judge Kathy Stinnett has announced a temporary postponement policy for Grant County Justice Court, effective through April 26, 2020. Anyone with a scheduled court date in Justice Court, located at 201 S. Humbolt, Suite 320, Canyon City, OR 97820, may receive a postponement by contacting the court as follows: phone at 541-575-1076, fax at 541-575-3811, mail (same as our physical address), or e-mail at gcjusticecourt@grantcounty-or.gov .

Citizens continue to have the option to respond to traffic citations in writing by choosing one of the options on the back of the citation and mailing it to the court. Mailed submissions must be received by your scheduled court date and time.

“Justice Court will remain open during regular business hours; however, we are asking all citizens to either contact the court for a postponement, or to use mail or e-mail to resolve your matter. Our primary concern is to protect those members of our public who are most vulnerable; persons over age 60, those with underlying health conditions, and those with weakened immune systems,” said Judge Stinnett. “We will make every effort possible to facilitate those needing access to legal services, but citizens must contact the court to receive the accommodations offered,” she said.

Declaration will provide more resources to Public Health; still no known COVID-19 cases in county

The Jefferson County Board of Commissioners held an emergency meeting at 4 p.m. Friday, March 13.

The board voted unanimously to declare a state of emergency in Jefferson County due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus.

No one has tested positive for the virus in Jefferson County, but Deschutes County has three presumptive positive cases. The declaration will help the county access state and federal resources.

The vote followed similar ones in Crook and Deschutes counties.

""As coronavirus -- aka COVID-19 -- continues to spread, local health officials have stressed that the risk to Central Oregonians remains low,"" said a press release from Jefferson County Public Health. ""Influenza continues to be a much more active threat to our community this time of year.""

""The tri-county response has been deliberate and consistent,"" said Public Health Director Mike Baker to the board.

""Public Health proposed this declaration and recognizes that this will continue to support the countywide response to this incident,"" the press release said. ""This declaration will support the need for resources including the costs for personnel or supplies for Public Health to respond to the ongoing situation.""

""The declarations are consistent with the state health emergency declaration and the national health emergency the president announced earlier today,"" it said.

""It is our goal to continue our public health preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them."" Mike Baker, director Jefferson County Public Health

Emily Wegener, the department's emergency preparedness and healthy communities coordinator, said the department is staying in contact with Deschutes and Crook counties, and they are coordinating their response.

""Jefferson County Public Health has developed strong partnerships with our local and neighboring public health departments, law enforcement, school districts, the Central Oregon Emergency Information Network and the medical community, including the St. Charles Health System,"" the press release said. ""The situation is monitored very closely and is following preparedness plans that are in place for any public health incident or outbreak response. Constant monitoring and tracking for the spread of the virus is ongoing, not only locally, but statewide and globally as well.""

Baker said his department has been tracking the time staff is dedicating to the coronavirus for a couple of weeks.

He said he knew they would need additional support, ""and this does allow that to happen.""

In the press release, Baker said, ""It is our goal to continue our public health preparedness efforts and to support our community at the highest possible level. We understand that this is a difficult time for everyone and urge you to stay calm. We hear your concerns and are addressing them.""

""Safety of staff and community members are the highest priority and efforts will continue around releasing updates to the public with the most current information and guidelines available,"" the press release continued. ""The leadership of the county respects the privacy of the community members, and when there is a positive case announced there will be no release of any identifiable information to protect the patient and family members.

""Jefferson County preparedness plans outline the process of mitigation, response and recovery for any emergency or disaster. This is a reminder to the community that Jefferson County Public Health has managed many outbreaks over the years and wants you to rest assured full precautions are being followed with this one as well,"" the release said.

Prevention

Jefferson County Public Health and the Oregon Health Authority continue to recommend people in Oregon take everyday precautions to prevent the spread of many respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19 and influenza.

The CDC is recommending nonpharmaceutical interventions to slow the spread of COVID-19, and other respiratory infections (including flu and pertussis) by taking everyday preventive actions, including:

If you feel sick, call ahead to your healthcare provider to discuss whether or not you need to be seen.

Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and then throw the tissue in the trash.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Avoid close contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.

Clean and disinfect surfaces that are often touched.

Take care of your health overall. Staying current on your vaccinations, including flu vaccine, eating well and exercising all help your body stay resilient.

Consult CDC's travel website for any travel advisories and steps to protect yourself if you plan to travel outside of the US.

Stay home if you are sick and talk with your employer now about a plan if you do become ill and cannot show up for work.

It is advised that anyone with compromised immune systems, chronic medical conditions and the elderly not attend large events and practice social distancing to protect yourselves.

""This week the state of Oregon announced a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people,"" the press release said. ""Jefferson County strongly believes in personal freedoms, including the right to assemble, but the statewide ban on large gatherings makes good sense, and should to be followed.

""There is much that is still unknown about the coronavirus, but what is known is that it is in our communities and we will see positive cases at some point,"" the press release continued. ""It is recommended that individuals follow the guidelines being offered to help minimize the spread of the virus. These are the same precautions suggested for any communicable disease.

For more information or general questions, contact Jefferson County Public Health at 715 SW Fourth Street, Madras, or 541-475-4456.

The public may also call 211 for general inquiries. The call center is set up to take calls.

County sick leave

The commissioners also approved temporary changes to the county's sick leave policy, provided they are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms and commit to Oregon Health Authority and Centers for Disease Control guidelines for home isolation.

In those cases, employees can accrue sick leave up to 80 negative hours; they will be charged 75% of their regular sick leave hours for each full shift while under home isolation; and they will not be required to present a doctor's note before returning to work unless they have been absent for more than 15 days.

Oregon,Jefferson,43913,https://www.alreporter.com/2020/03/23/jefferson-county-orders-more-businesses-closed-amid-covid-19-crisis/,Jefferson County orders more businesses closed amid COVID-19 crisis,"Alabama hospitals are already beginning to see a sharp increase in hospitalizations related to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 as the number of confirmed cases accelerates in the state.

Data gathered over the last 24 hours by the Alabama Political Reporter show that nearly 100 people are hospitalized statewide with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 or illness the hospital highly suspects as being COVID-19.

An even larger number of patients are hospitalized with illnesses hospitals believe may be COVID-19 but tests have not confirmed infection yet. If the number of patients who are awaiting test results for unknown respiratory illnesses is included, the number is closer to 300. It’s likely hospitals are treating these patients as if they have COVID-19, out of an abundance of caution.

This data is delayed and shouldn’t be misconstrued as totally reflective of what hospitals are handling right now. The number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 is likely to be much higher than we are able to report, because of testing result delays, other problems with data reporting and hospitals we weren’t able to gather data from.

Our data is limited because it only includes some of the state’s largest hospitals, and not all hospitals provided the same type of data to us. Some did not respond to our requests for information.

But our limited data show that the total confirmed case count of 283 confirmed cases in the state is misleading when trying to determine the strain already being placed on the state’s hospitals. The number of people with the virus, as state health officials have said, is much larger than the confirmed case count. Hospitals have been conserving testing supplies by only testing more serious and symptomatic cases.

At UAB alone, 45 total COVID-19 patients were hospitalized as of Tuesday. Eighteen of those are on ventilators. At least 81 are hospitalized, under observation and awaiting test results, Dr. Sarah Nafziger said Tuesday.

The number since then is likely to have increased. On Tuesday alone, the number of patients being treated for confirmed COVID-19 infection increased from 17 to 45. Nafziger said the growth has been “exponential.” But UAB is not the only hospital in the state dealing with an influx.

In Lee County, which has the third-highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases after Jefferson County and Shelby County, East Alabama Medical Center is caring for more than 30 patients confirmed as having or suspected of having the virus.

Seven of EAMC’s hospitalized patients have been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19. One of them arrived from a nursing home. But, as of Tuesday night, 27 patients who are hospitalized are suspected of having COVID-19. The hospital is waiting for dozens of tests to return results. One patient has been discharged after being hospitalized because of COVID-19.

Lee County has increasingly become a “hot spot” in the state for COVID-19 infections. The hospital has submitted 700 kits for testing. 416 have been negative, but 252 are still waiting for results. The age range of people in Lee County tested at EAMC’s sites, who have tested positive, is between 20 and 82. Health-wise, they ranged from mild symptoms to severe symptoms. The average time for a test to get results is four days, but some have taken up to seven days, the hospital said.



EAMC is asking everyone in the area to shelter in place at home. Sheltering in place means you stay at home with immediate family members only and should not leave your home except for essential activities such as food, medical care, or work.

At Jackson Hospital in Montgomery, there are 5 patients hospitalized, but their COVID-19 tests are pending, the hospital said.

“We currently have 5 pending in-patient cases who are being cared for using the appropriate CDC recommended isolation protocols,” the hospital said in a statement. “Keeping patients healthy and safe is central to our mission. The Jackson Hospital staff remain consistent in year-round emergency preparedness training.”

APR‘s interviews with health care practitioners at the hospital suggest the number of suspected cases arriving at the hospital for in-patient or out-patient emergency care may be higher.

At Baptist Health’s three Montgomery-area hospitals, the health system has treated and discharged one lab-confirmed case of COVID-19, a spokesperson said. But at least 39 patients hospitalized across the system’s three hospitals are awaiting the results of tests for unknown illnesses that include COVID-19, severe bronchitis and the seasonal flu.

In Dothan, at Southeast Medical Center, which serves Southeast Alabama, Southwest George and Northwest Florida, at least two patients are hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The hospital did not report how many suspected cases it is treating.

Huntsville Hospital CEO David Spillers said Wednesday morning that at least 41 people across the system’s hospitals are hospitalized and awaiting test results for COVID-19. “Information is coming in as we walk in the door,” Spillers said. Ten of those are in Madison County, and the hospital’s Decatur-Morgan Hospital has 16 in-patients awaiting results. Four in-patients in Madison and Morgan County are confirmed to have COVID-19.

Spillers said the hospital system currently has adequate beds and supplies, and has taken precautions to prepare for more patients. “I guess this is like preparing for a Category 5 hurricane, and hoping like heck it doesn’t hit you, but knowing if it doesn’t hit you, it’ll probably hit somebody else,” Spillers said.

It should be noted that the numbers in this report do not include patients hospitalized for illnesses and health problems that are not related to COVID-19. People in the state are still suffering heart attacks, having babies and suffering injuries and other health problems that require hospitalization. But hospitals have been able to free up beds by canceling elective procedures.

DCH Regional Medical Center in Tuscaloosa, Springhill Hospital in Mobile and Infirmary Health in Mobile did not respond to requests for information by the time of publication. Brookwood Health in Birmingham declined to provide any data.

So far, the Alabama Department of Public Health has not released hospitalization data, but on a conference call Tuesday with the press, State Health Officer, Dr. Scott Harris, said about 8 or 9 percent of the state’s confirmed cases are hospitalized at this time.

“Some hospitals are reporting increased numbers of patients that seem like they probably are infected with this virus,” Harris said. “And so we have been planning for some time for the possibility of a hospital surge.”

As of Tuesday morning, at least 283 cases of the virus have been confirmed in the state. Nine percent would equate to roughly 25 patients being treated at hospitals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. That would not include suspected cases, but either way, the number is lower than what hospitals have reported to APR and is likely significantly delayed.

“That’s somewhat lower than most of the other states in the country have reported,” Harris said Tuesday. “And so we’re still working hard to make sure we can verify those numbers. But at this point, I think we certainly would say that at least eight or nine percent of those patients who’ve been diagnosed are in a hospital setting.”

Harris has said some hospitals in the state are already nearing their capacity, and the state has been working with hospitals to prepare for more cases. “It would not take large numbers of people for them to overwhelm their capacity,” said on the call Tuesday.",school_business_closure,21145

The City of Springfield declared a local state of emergency Monday night. The City of Eugene and Lane County both are expected to do the same Tuesday.

Springfield, which has a regular city council meeting scheduled for 7 p.m. Monday evening, voted to approve the declaration and then voted to approve allowing the use of $100,000 from the general fund for fighting the outbreak.

The Eugene City Council is expected to make an emergency declaration at a special noon meeting at Eugene Public Library on Tuesday. The Lane County Board of Commissioners will decide on making an emergency declaration at its normal meeting at the Public Service Building in Eugene at 9 a.m. Tuesday.

City of Springfield Spokeswoman Amber Fossen said an emergency declaration would:

– Fully implement its Emergency Operations Plan, which governs how the city Emergency Operations Center will operate.

– Suspend contracting requirements for emergency goods and services.

– Temporarily exempt emergency medical facilities or other necessary development from permit requirements.

– Order additional special regulations or requirements if other emergency matters come up for council approval after-the-fact as soon as possible.

According to city counselors at the meeting, the emergency declaration was instituted to make daily operations run smoother and to give City Manager Ron Chandler more tools to take action when needed in a more timely fashion.

From the Lincoln City Municipal Code:

A state of emergency exists whenever any part of the city of Lincoln City is suffering or in imminent danger of suffering from a tornado, storm, high water, wind-driven water, earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snow or ice storm, drought, fire, explosion, health hazard, infestation, toxic substance, civil disorder, disruption of community services, or any other catastrophe whereby extraordinary measures must be taken to save lives, to protect public health, safety and welfare, to minimize destruction of property or the environment, or to avert or lessen the threat of a major disaster. (Ord. 2018-03 § 1)

CITY MANAGER UPDATE

One city counselor had reservations with voting for the declaration because they did not want to add to the panic and confusion. He proceeded to ask questions to make sure they were doing the right thing.

“In trying times, take a deep breath and try to remain calm,” the counselor said. “We have a great community that cares and helps each other. Businesses are still open. Just remember to wash your hands, love on your kids and family and shop local. We’ll all get through this together.”

Under the declaration, the city manager can redirect funds for emergency use, prohibit price gouging and issue other emergency orders.

Restricting travel and curfews are a couple extreme examples of what the city manager can do, and curtailing commercial activity, prohibiting or restricting the sale of alcohol and cannabis, and prohibiting the possession of loaded firearms on public streets, public property or any outdoor place are all powers granted to the city manager. For a full list check out the Lincoln City Municipal Code:

MUNICIPAL CODE: EMERGENCY OPERATIONS

City offices will remain open although the City prefers to conduct business by phone.

From the City of Lincoln City’s website:

Also on March 16, 2020 Governor Brown issued further directives concerning COVID‐19. The governor’s actions are effective March 17, 2020 lasting four (4) weeks until April 17, 2020.

These directives include the following:

All restaurants will be closed and restricted to serving takeout and delivery food only. Exemptions to this ban include grocery stores, pharmacies, retail stores and workplaces.

Gatherings of 25 or more individuals are prohibited.

Governor Brown at the same time urged Oregonians to avoid being around 10 people at a time and suggested businesses that cannot serve customers in a way that minimizes interpersonal contact should shut down completely during the pandemic. In response to both the emergency and Governor Brown’s directives, the City of Lincoln City has taken the following actions:

1. The Lincoln City Culinary center will close from March 17, 2020 through April 17, 2020.

2. The City will hold municipal court on March 17, 2020 and strict social distancing will be enforced. The court will then be closed until April 17, 2020.

The Linn County Board of Supervisors passed temporary employment policies for the county’s workers on Monday, including paid leave, as a result of COVID-19.

The temporary policy also ensures “the continuity of Linn County government services.” Most county buildings have closed to the public, but people can contact Linn County departments by phone or email. Some employees will have the option to work from home.

The measures taken by Linn County are consistent with recommendations issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Under the new policy, county employees will not be required to use their accrued sick leave or other accrued paid leave under certain conditions relating to COVID-19, including:

• If an employee tests positive for COVID-19 and must therefore stay home per their doctor’s and/or Iowa Department of Public Health’s orders.

• If an employee is quarantined per their doctor’s, Iowa Department of Public Health and/or the Center for Disease Control orders due to suspected exposure with COVID-19

• If an employee has been exposed to someone who has the virus and needs to be tested.

• If an employee is needed to care for a family member who has the virus or has been in contact with someone who has the virus.

• If an employee has traveled to an area that is on a restricted travel list (domestic or international) in effect on the planned date of return.

The employee will remain on paid status for up to 14 calendar days if the above criteria is met.

There are circumstances where employees will be required to use their accrued sick leave, but it is expected this will only be until Wednesday, March 25.

“On April 2, the federal law is requiring that employees meeting the circumstances currently in our Section VII be employer paid and not required to use their own sick leave,” Linn County spokesperson Joi Alexander said in an email. “Linn County’s HR director is recommending the Board of Supervisors approve this change for County employees on Wednesday instead of waiting until April 2 out of an abundance of caution and concern for the safety and health of the County government workforce.”

The circumstances currently not covered by paid leave but would be if the board passes the recommendation include:

• An employee showing potential virus symptoms or and who has consulted with a health care provider and submits proof of such consultation.

• An employee who chooses to self-isolate due to an underlying health condition or age, or that of a spouse or dependent, and submits a recommendation for the self-isolation from a health care provider.

• An employee who needs to stay home to care for a family member due to the closing of a school or child/adult daycare. An employee choosing this option may be subject to callback in order to maintain minimum staffing levels at 24/7 operations and county-designated essential services.

SALEM – Oregon schools will remain closed through the end of April, extending by a month the original closure ordered last week by Gov. Kate Brown.

“We must act now to flatten the curve and slow the rate of COVID-19 transmission in Oregon. Otherwise, we face a higher strain on our medical system and greater loss of life to this disease,” Brown said in a Tuesday evening announcement.

Public schools, which were scheduled to open April 1, are now closed until April 28. The order affects about 580,000 students statewide. About 5,000 students attend public schools in Malheur County.

“School districts may call on public school educators and employees to deliver limited learning and support services,” her statement said.

She said she expected the state’s school districts to continue providing meals and child care.

“This includes the delivery of food assistance and offering child care for essential health care professionals and first responders,” the statement said.

The governor also said that “each district will pay their regular employees during the closure.”

In a statement Tuesday evening, Jim Green, the executive director of the Oregon Schools Boards Association said, “This is a new reality for all of us, and we appreciate that the governor and her staff are acting quickly against a moving target. What we are working on in the short term is figuring out ways to deliver learning to kids remotely, and in many cases ensuring that they are being fed. We’re going to get through this, but in the meantime we’ve got dozens of questions to get sorted out and 581,000 students to take care of.”

﻿And this from John Larson, president of the Oregon Education Association, the union representing teachers: “OEA supports Governor Brown’s decision to safeguard the health of students and educators by extending the closure period of Oregon’s public schools. We also commend the governor for her commitment to maintaining vital nutrition and mental health services for our students, and for directing districts to ensure all school employees are paid during these closures.”

Brown earlier in the day tightened restrictions on nursing homes, residential care facilities and other licensed facilities, barring all visitors. There are about 30,000 Oregonians in such living circumstances.",school_business_closure,30479

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown Sunday declared a state of emergency as officials detected seven new cases of the novel coronavirus, including the first known case in Marion County.

Five new cases were reported in Washington County, where a school employee was diagnosed with the disease at the start of Oregon’s outbreak, and one case in Douglas County.

The announcement of the new cases brings to 14 the known presumed cases of people infected with COVID-19.

“Today’s news is both troubling and expected,” said Pat Allen, director of the Oregon Health Authority. “We know we will see more cases.”

Authorities were releasing few details about the new patients, but said the person ill in Marion County contracted the disease through community spread, not from foreign travel or contact another person known to be infected.

“I am declaring a state of emergency,” Brown said in a Sunday news conference with health officials.

The governor’s declaration is intended to free up more state resources to combat the spread of the disease. That includes activating a corps of retired medical professionals to help, including in conducting trace investigations to identify anyone who has had contact with those diagnosed as infected.

Allen urged Oregonians to take the outbreak seriously and to not stigmatize those who are infected or under monitoring.

“We cannot combat COVID-19 if we turn on each other,” Allen said.

Can I get COVID-19 from my pets or other animals?

There is no reason at this time to think that any animals, including pets, in the United States might be a source of infection with this new coronavirus that causes COVID-19. To date, CDC has not received any reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States.

Pets have other types of coronaviruses that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cannot infect people and are not related to the current COVID-19 outbreak.

However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene.

Should I avoid contact with pets or other animals if I am sick with COVID-19?

You should restrict contact with pets and other animals while you are sick with COVID-19, just like you would around other people. Although there have not been reports of pets or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the new coronavirus. When possible, have another member of your household care for your animals while you are sick. If you are sick with COVID-19, avoid contact with your pet, including petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food. If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets.

What about imported animals or animal products?

CDC does not have any evidence to suggest that imported animals or animal products pose a risk for spreading COVID-19 in the United States.

What precautions should be taken for animals that have recently been imported from outside the United States?

At this time, there is no evidence that companion animals, including pets and service animals, can spread COVID-19. As with any animal introduced to a new environment, animals recently imported should be observed daily for signs of illness. If an animal becomes ill, the animal should be examined by a veterinarian. Call your local veterinary clinic before bringing the animal into the clinic and let them know that the animal was recently imported from another country.",state_of_emergency,11336

""Are we going to be infected,"" Yamamoto said. ""I can tell you pretty much yes, we will.""

Votes for a resolution declaring the emergency and enacting a contingency plan passed unanimously. The state of emergency will last until April 1, when it will be re-evaluated.

Plant Manager Mark Elston issued a statement about the employee and the closure. In the statement, Elston said the employee was tested at the local hospital and advised by medical professionals to self-quarantine at home pending results.

“The employee is following that advice and has committed to inform us of a positive or negative result once known,” Elston said. “We will let our employees know this result and will keep the appropriate community leaders informed.”

Elston said upon learning of the possible infection, Hampton Lumber Mill closed to clean and sanitize the areas the employee frequented. Break rooms, restrooms, offices, and control rooms were sanitized by a local cleaning service.

“We take the health and safety of our employees and the community very seriously. We will monitor the situation and take the appropriate action to safeguard our employees and our operation as we get additional information,” Elston said.

UPDATE at 9 p.m. on March 22

Limits on visitors to the Northern Oregon Coast expanded significantly on Sunday in multiple towns from Astoria to Tillamook.

The Astoria City Council voted Sunday to ban people from outside the area from staying in hotels and other commercial lodging, joining Warrenton's ban of overnight tourists, to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

To the south, Seaside will close access to city parks and the Oregon Coast beach in addition to hotels and other lodging on Monday. Cannon Beach will close hotels on Monday while also taking the exceptional step of excluding day-visitors through early April, according to a city resolution.

""All visitors within the City’s jurisdiction are ordered to evacuate within twenty-four (24) hours of the effective date of this Resolution and remain evacuated while this Resolution is in effect,"" said the resolution. ""A visitor is defined as any individual who is spending time in the City for pleasure, recreation or non-business reasons and is not a resident, property owner or business owner.""

Finally, Tillamook is closing parks and all transient lodging including hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts and short-term rentals, including condos, ""to all visitors who are not providing essential services or are here for commercial reasons such as construction, trucking, etc.,"" the city wrote.

More coronavirus impact: All Oregon state parks closing March 23 amid coronavirus pandemic

ORIGINAL STORY

A town on the Oregon Coast has a simple message for tourists: go home.

The city of Warrenton passed a resolution Saturday night that essentially makes it illegal for people who live outside city limits to stay the night, including at one of Oregon’s largest campgrounds, due to concerns of coronavirus spread.

Resolution 2565, which came after an emergency declaration, was in response to thousands of people flooding the northern Oregon Coast Friday and Saturday despite the pleas of state officials to stay home.

“The situation meets every definition of a clear and present danger,” Warrenton Mayor Henry Balensifer told the Statesman Journal. “We had people flooding our shores and town from areas that are hotspots for the virus, treating it like a normal spring break.

“We saw hundreds of people in one place, our highways completely clogged and a very real danger of the virus spreading to our residents and overwhelming our medical facilities.

“We had to do something.”

Balensifer said he wouldn’t be surprised if other cities on the coast crafted similar responses. Indeed, two other Oregon Coast mayors called on tourists to stay away by Saturday's end.

But the Warrenton resolution has real bite. It was unanimously passed by the City Council in cooperation with city police, who will have the power to arrest offenders, officials said.

The order does not outlaw people from visiting the city during the day, ""although we strongly discourage it right now,"" Balensifer said.

Order outlaws tourists from spending the night

The order essentially makes it illegal for people who live outside the city to stay overnight by shutting down anywhere they might stay.

Granted by the power of the emergency declaration, Balensifer said, the order closes camping at the city's marina, on private property and at its four campgrounds — including Fort Stevens State Park, which has over 400 sites.

The Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, which originally said it would allow some campers to stay through April 2, said it would comply with the city's order to close camping at the state park.

“We’re going to respect the city’s directive,” state parks spokesman Chris Havel said of Fort Stevens. “Our intention is to do everything we can to work with them.”

Update: All Oregon state parks closing March 23 amid coronavirus pandemic

The order also closes the city's hotels and short-term rental houses, such as those found on Airbnb, Balensifer said.

There are multiple exemptions, including for camp hosts, employees and anyone “living as a long-term resident of the facilities.""

""I understand some people are worried about trying to find a place to stay, but we're not charged to take care of those people,"" Balensifer said in a video posted on Facebook. ""It's hard enough to handle what we have, we can't handle thousands of people flooding the city if one gets sick and it spreads.""

Those who disobey the order — remaining in town overnight after a 24-hour period that began at 5 p.m. Saturday — would be subject to a Class C misdemeanor. It is an “arrestable offense,” but Balensifer said the goal was to make sure the order was carried out safely.

""We're giving the police department the ability to use common sense,"" he said.

Balensifer stressed that he’d spoken with county and state officials about the resolution, including senator Betsy Johnson and Lisa Sumption, director of the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department.

“We didn't make this decision in a vacuum,” he said.

Other mayors on the Oregon Coast speak out

Warrenton wasn't the only coastal town asking visitors to go home.

Tillamook Mayor Suzanne Weber posted a video Saturday asking ""all visitors at the north coast on non-essential business to leave immediately,"" he said.

Astoria Mayor Bruce Jones issued an even more pointed response, saying he was ""appalled by the sight of tens of thousands of irresponsible vacationers flocking to the coast, with callous disregard for residents’ health and safety."" he wrote.

Jones said he was convening an emergency meeting of the Astoria City Council Sunday ""to consider an emergency measure closing commercial lodging to non-residents.""

Meanwhile, Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler tweeted frustration about the crowds heading from Oregon's largest city to the beach.

""Bumper to bumper traffic headed to the coast. Reports of block parties on streets. I cannot stress this enough. #COVID19 continues to spread because people don't know they have it,"" Wheeler wrote.

The commissioners voted 3-0 to pass a resolution declaring an emergency as a local response to the outbreak of COVID-19.

J.B. Brock, Union County emergency services manager, said the resolution will help the county to respond faster to situations related to the new coronavirus.

It will give the county the authority to take certain steps, such as like drawing money from a variety of funds for the purchase of protective equipment and the like.

The declaration also provides the county the authority to take steps such as bypassing the bidding process if a contractor needs to be hired for an urgent project.

Commissioner Donna Beverage said the emergency declaration will make it easier for the county to help those in need of assistance.

“It will unleash opportunities for us to help,’’ Beverage said, noting that local business owners are among those who could be assisted by the county.

Brock told the commissioners before their vote that everyone needs to help each other to survive the COVID-19 crisis.

“We need to be taking care of each other as a community,’’ Brock said.

“We need to be checking in our neighbors, to call them or knock on their doors to see what they need.’’

BEAVER COUNTY (KDKA) — The first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in Beaver County.

Beaver County commissioners held a press briefing on Monday night to announce one resident tested positive for coronavirus.

Officials also declared a state of emergency in the county.

“Our first steps, first and foremost, is the safety of our residents,” Beaver County Commissioner Daniel Camp said.

The county was notified by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency at 7 p.m., officials say.

Peter Carbone, superintendent of Aliquippa School District, says the patient is a member of the Aliquippa School District community.

“The information has not been officially confirmed by county, Pennsylvania and federal officials,” Carbone said in a release. “Due to confidentiality consideration, I am not able to share any other details.”

No other details about the resident were released.

“We’ve been talking about this for 10 days,” Beaver County Commissioner Jack Manning said. “We’ve been working on plans. We’ve been implementing what we can.”

Officials say Beaver is classified fourth-class county, so they can only recommend businesses and restaurants/bars to close.

They cannot FORCE businesses to close.

The new case now brings the total number of infected people in Pennsylvania to at least 77.

Six of those confirmed cases are in Allegheny County, and one case is in Washington County.

Berks County has declared a disaster emergency due to the threat of coronavirus.

- Advertisement -

Chief Administrative Officer Ron Seaman said at a county commissioners meeting Thursday morning that the declaration should not be seen by the public as a signal to panic, but rather a way to make sure the county can respond as quickly as possible if an outbreak occurs.

“In any kind of situation like this, time is of the essence,” he said. “And acting sooner rather than later is always beneficial. This will allow us to relax the standard in which we normally have to operate so that we can make valid and rational decisions in this ever-changing climate.”

Berks has not yet had a reported case of COVID-19, the coronavirus that has been spreading across the globe.

As of today, there were 22 cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, according to the state Department of Health.

Berks County Solicitor Christine Sadler said the emergency declaration will allow officials to mobilize quickly and activate a menu of powers they can use to respond to a crisis situation. It also allows the commissioners to conduct meetings as necessary without having to publicly advertise those meetings 24 hours in advance.

Seaman said Berks County Department of Emergency Services Director Brian Gottschall has been collaborating with school districts, local health professionals and municipalities to ensure the appropriate people have the supplies and resources needed to continue services.

Last week, the board decided to set aside $10,000 in emergency spending to be used exclusively to fund activity related to the coronavirus response. Seaman said he will provide a weekly report outlining expenses to various departments for review.

""This $10,000 isn't a cap,"" Commissioners Chairman Christian Y. Leinbach said at a budget and operations meeting last Thursday. ""The $10,000 is simply a starting point for the fund, and we wanted to establish this fund so that everything is thought out and documented.""

In addition to declaring an emergency disaster, the county is also asking people to refrain from visiting Berks Heim nursing home to help ensure the safety of residents and staff.

“We understand the importance of loved ones remaining in contact and encourage visitors to use alternative communication methods if possible,” Seaman said. “All individuals, including staff, who come into the building are being screened.”

He added that Berks Heim administrators are in close contact with the local and state emergency management agencies and following guidelines set by those agencies.

There will also be no visitation permitted at the county prison in Bern Township. A message posted on the facility website said there will be no family or friend visitation as well as no professional visitation until further notice.

Leinbach asked residents to avoid gathering in large crowds and practice good hygiene to limit the spread of the coronavirus as much as possible.

Commissioner Kevin S. Barnhardt said the county is working to make the April 28 primary election as safe as possible for those who want to vote on the touchscreen machines at their polling locations. He said poll workers will be required to wear gloves to prevent the spread of the illness.

But he also urged residents to consider casting their votes by mail to avoid lines and crowded spaces. Applications for mail-in ballots can be found on the homepage of the election services website.

“We just want to make sure people are utilizing every tool necessary to be able to vote,” he said. “We really hope that people take advantage of this new option.”

Commissioner Michael Rivera reminded residents that they should be checking a website the county launched last week that is specifically designed to communicate information about the coronavirus.

“We have been working with state and federal authorities and local experts to make sure we are providing the most accurate information to our residents because we feel that it’s important we do all that we can to limit the spread as much as possible,” he said.

The board also voted on Thursday to formally establish a chain of command with respect to the response.

Because the county does not have its own health department like some of its neighboring counties, the commissioners have been designated to take the lead on the response effort by coordinating public-health initiatives and creating a centralized system to distribute health information. Seaman will be second in that chain, Gottschall will serve as third in that line and a public relations coordinator will serve as the final link in the chain.",state_of_emergency,413521

Those municipalities are Doylestown, Buckingham, Warrington, Warminster, Northampton, Wrightstown, Upper Makefield, Lower Makefield, Upper Southampton, Lower Southampton, Middletown and Bensalem.

The county has posted a map that's updated daily showing where coronavirus cases have been confirmed.

Meanwhile, businesses in Bucks County were responding to a state mandate for most of them to close their doors during the outbreak. Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close, although the deadline has been pushed back to 8 a.m. Monday to handle appeals.

""On the whole, we have found that businesses in Bucks County are doing the right thing by their customers, employees and their own family members,"" said Consumer Protection Director Michael Bannon. ""In this unprecedented time it is difficult for any of us to navigate the expectations placed on us. We appreciate those that have chosen to play it safe over the risk of exposing others and themselves to the COVID-19 virus.""

Pennsylvania,Clearfield,43915,https://gantdaily.com/2020/03/25/clearfield-co-ratifies-extends-state-of-emergency-declaration/,"Clearfield Co. Ratifies, Extends State of Emergency Declaration","CLEARFIELD – In response to the coronavirus pandemic and Gov. Tom Wolf’s orders, the Clearfield County Commissioners on Tuesday ratified its county-wide state of emergency declaration and extended it through the duration of the crisis.

Commissioner Chairman Tony Scotto said all county facilities are currently closed to the general public, and they will not permit visitors until further notice. He said drop boxes are in place, and county officials can be reached by phone, e-mail or mail.

The primary county phone number is 814-765-2641 (a complete directory is available online), and residents can also find more information on the Clearfield County Government Web site: www.clearfieldco.org.

Commissioner Dave Glass said there’s a lot of confusion surrounding the mandated closures, and the answer is that state officials have left it up to each county to decide what’s essential and how to handle situations.

At the present time, he said the county hasn’t laid anyone off, and the commissioners are hoping to avoid that if they can. But, he added, that the situation is constantly changing and they’ll just have to see how it goes.

“It changes almost daily,” Glass said, “and every time we try to make a plan, something changes. We have a plan and it’s going to change again so we’re thankful for everyone’s patience and ability to work together.”

Commissioner John A. Sobel reminded that Wolf has ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses to close to the public, and that the commissioners urge compliance to the governor’s mitigation efforts.

He said the commissioners understand many of the county’s small business owners are concerned with either having to shut down temporarily or having a significant loss in business.

He said they want business owners to carefully follow the guidelines from various levels of government so that everyone can stay safe. He also encouraged residents who feel comfortable to patronize the businesses that are able to remain open.

“Eventually, the restrictions associated with the pandemic will be lifted,” he said, “and when they are, let’s swamp our local businesses … because they make life so much better in Clearfield County and are going to need our help to get back on their feet.”

Sobel said that all three commissioners are available to help local business owners in any way they can, including with finding and providing information with regards to financial assistance.

Glass stressed that COVID-19 is a rapidly-evolving public health crisis, guidelines are changing almost daily and the commissioners will keep the public up to date with the most current information.

He said there’s already been talk in the state legislature about possibly postponing the April 28 Primary Election until June, which he believes will happen because no one is in position to hold an election at this time.

Glass said the county will notify residents when that becomes official and more information is available.

Because the county has no idea how long this crisis will last, Scotto urged residents to diligently follow the federal and state guidance for social distancing, not congregating in large groups and limiting unnecessary travel.

Tuesday commissioners’ meeting was open to the press, but streamed live on YouTube for the public. The April 7 workshop meeting was cancelled for public safety reasons, and the commissioners will decide protocol for its April 14 voting meeting when that date approaches.

What are the symptoms of the coronavirus and what should you do?

According to the Centers for Disease Control, reported illnesses from COVID-19 have ranged from mild symptoms to severe illness and death. Fever, cough and shortness of breath might appear 2 to 14 days after you've been exposed to the virus.

If you think you've been exposed to the coronavirus and develop a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as cough or difficulty breathing, call your primary healthcare provider immediately.

With further spread of the virus and disruptions to everyday life expected, officials remind residents to wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.

You should also cover coughs and sneezes with your elbow (not your hands), clean surfaces that are frequently touched (such as countertops, light switches and phones), and stay home if you are sick.

People are also asked not to attend large gatherings and to practice ""social distancing."" On Monday, President Donald Trump announced new guidelines Americans should follow over the next 15 days, including avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people.

Erie Mayor Joe Schember on Tuesday issued a state of emergency declaration for the city, effective immediately, because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Schember said the declaration is necessary to protect city residents. He also said that by officially declaring a state of emergency ""it helps ensure that we can be reimbursed by the federal government for any expenses incurred by the city"" related to combating the coronavirus.

""These are extraordinary times, which call for extraordinary measures,"" Schember said. ""We need to do everything we can to protect the residents of the city of Erie and our brave first responders while still providing critical public services. We ask everyone to stay calm, stay home and stay safe.""

According to city officials, the emergency declaration is important to obtain federal funding in response to COVID-19. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will reimburse the city for up to 75 percent of emergency costs incurred while under an emergency declaration, Schember said.

Schember said police, fire, ambulance and animal control services will continue as normal.

The action followed the declaration of a national emergency by President Donald Trump, and Gov. Tom Wolf’s similar action on the state level.

According to the commissioners’ proclamation, the coronavirus has caused or threatens to cause injury, damage and suffering to Juniata County and has “endangered the health, safety and welfare of the substantial number of persons residing in Juniata County.” The commissioners said COVID-19 threatens to create problems greater in scope than Juniata County may be able to resolve.

Emergency management measures are required to reduce the severity of this epidemic and to protect the health, safety and welfare of affected residents in Juniata County, according to the commissioners.

The commission has directed Juniata County Emergency Management Coordinator Allen Weaver to take “all appropriate action needed to alleviate effects of the disaster, to aid in the restoration of essential public services and to take any other emergency response action deemed necessary to respond to this.”

Additionally, due to the state of emergency, Juniata County has implemented the following measures effective immediately. The public entry point for all courthouse business will remain at the Bridge Street entrance for essential transactions only. The wheelchair-accessible entrance remains at the rear of the courthouse. Entrance doors for the Annex and Bousum buildings and other offsite facilities will be locked; however, staff will be available for essential business and to receive phone calls and emails. There will be a drop off and pick up area for essential documents that will be placed near the Bridge Street entrance. A list of affected agencies is included with this story.

In other business, President Judge Kenneth A. Mummah issued a judicial emergency due to COVID-19 that will continue through April 14. The jury selection that was to take place Tuesday was postponed until April, and speedy trial rights have been temporarily waved. The judge said court staff are currently working on measures to allow filings to be done electronically. Mummah said there will be meetings with the register and recorder’s office and the prothonotary’s office regarding these issues.

Mummah said courts will still be open for protection-from-abuse petitions, any type of emergency custody or guardianship petitions and other emergencies. The judge also stated courts are not closed but routine business will be delayed. Mummah said individuals whose cases will be delayed will be contacted, but otherwise current schedules will be maintained and courts will be determining which cases are neccesary and which ones will be delayed.

Other business included approval of the following:

¯ The execution of the 2019 “9-1-1 Statewide Interconnectivity” grant as recommended by Allen Weaver, Emergency Services Director. The total amount of the award is $118,999.54.

¯ The submission of Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board grant as recommended by Melissa Fausey, Juniata County Board Community Coordinator.

So, the commissioners have declared a state of emergency for the county.

NEW CASTLE — With cases of the COVID-19 virus getting closer and closer to the county, the Lawrence County Commissioners decided Tuesday morning it was time to act.

The commissioners unanimously agreed to declare a state of emergency for the county.

The designation will allow officials to call emergency meetings without normal public notice to deal with health and safety issues, puts residents on further alert and opens the possibility the county could eventually be eligible for state and federal disaster funds if needed.

Morgan Boyd, commissioners chairman, said they intend to make every effort to inform the public of upcoming meetings or at least brief them on what happens at each meeting.

A leadership council to oversee the emergency also was created. It will include the commissioners, the county chief administrator, the sheriff, the emergency management coordinator, the human resources director and the county medical director.

Although Lawrence County has not had any positive or even suspected cases of the virus yet, county Public Safety Director Jeff Parish said, ""It’s not if, it’s when it’s going to affect us.""

Tuesday’s move was precipitated by news the night before that a confirmed case had been reported in neighboring Beaver County. Cases also have been reported in Allegheny and Washington counties over the last few days, a sign the disease is moving into southwestern Pennsylvania after weeks of it only being reported in the eastern part of the state.

Gov. Tom Wolf issued a proclamation of emergency for the state two weeks ago and last week ordered all public K-12 schools be closed until the end of the month. On Monday, Wolf urged all non-essential businesses to close for two weeks and for all bars and restaurants to move to take out or delivery only.

Boyd said world health organizations have described the virus’ spread as a pandemic and noted many countries and other states also are struggling with its impact.

Fellow commissioner Loretta Spielvogel added, ""We haven’t thought we were immune to something happening, not just in the state, but also the world.""

Boyd said county officials have been discussing the situation for weeks and have been making adjustments all along. He said the courthouse remains open and county business continues to be conducted, but all residents are being urged to limit their visits. Also, regular cleanings of the building have been increased and hand sanitizer stations have been created near entrances. Travel by county employees also has been restricted.

Many departments have asked residents to pay bills and fines, seek forms and conduct other business with their offices through telephone, mail or online. Drop boxes outside also are available for checks.

Commissioner Dan Vogler said he understands what has been going on is scary, but he urged everyone to remain calm. ""This is a new situation for all of us,"" he said.

Vogler and other officials said they are doing all they can to protect residents and get the county through the crisis. Parish said the goal is to ""flatten the curve"" and make sure everyone doesn’t get sick at the same time and overwhelm local health care facilities.

Noting he and other department heads have been in constant contact with their peers in neighboring counties, Parish said they are doing a lot behind the scenes to get on top of the situation.

""We have a plan for everything,"" he said, noting every part of the county is covered by plans.

Boyd urged everyone to follow health department guidelines about social distancing and proper hand washing to limit the spread and those who do feel symptoms consult with their doctors.

He stressed the need to get proper information on what is going on from government and legitimate news services, not social media sites, which have been spreading false statements that could be dangerous and make things worse.",state_of_emergency,89333

Read the restrictions in place for Luzerne County residents here.

Pedri could not confirm the age or gender of the person who tested positive, as reported by the state Department of Health. He also said he did not know what municipality the person lives in.

Tom Wolf Orders Mass Closings In Montgomery County Following More Coronavirus Cases,"



MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Pa. (CBS) — Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf is ordering mass closings in Montgomery County in an effort to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the county. During a press conference Thursday, Wolf says the closures include all schools, gyms, community centers and entertainment venues.

The state is taking “significant and decisive social distancing” and will begin putting the plan into effect tomorrow. It will last 14 days in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19.

“No mass gatherings should be held, including conferences and rallies. By closing these facilities, we can control the spread of this disease, that’s the hope. And we can redirect our public safety and health officials to where they are needed the most,” Wolf said.

Pa Gov Wolf announces massive closings in Montgomery County in an effort to control the spread of #COVID19 #cbs3 @CBSPhilly — Stephanie Stahl (@StahlCBS3) March 12, 2020

Wolf says all critical infrastructure will remain open, including all health care facilities, gas stations, grocery stores, government and mass transit.

Wolf says Montgomery County is the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak where there are 13 of the state’s 22 cases. Among the cases are a doctor and a police officer — people with broad contacts in the community.

“The goal is not to shut anybody down, the goal is to keep Pennsylvania safe and by taking action, decisive action to mitigate, we’re moving beyond simply containing,” Wolf said.

The governor’s closing order covers places like the Ardmore train station. Suburban Square is currently open.

The King of Prussia Mall says it will remain open and is leaving it up to retailers to decide whether or not they will close.

“King of Prussia will remain open for our retailers, and we are leaving it to them to decide whether they remain open or close. With respect to Governor Wolf’s statement today, the Governor did not mandate store closures and did not define what nonessential retail is. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will comply with any federal, state or local government requirements as they arise. We will keep you posted on any new developments,” the mall said in a statement.

Plymouth Meeting Mall and Willow Grove Park Mall will be closed for two weeks effective Friday.

The Valley Forge Casino Resort will close to the public on Friday and will remain closed through Friday, March, 27.

Shoppers stocked up at local groceries stores in preparation.

“We are topping up from our previous pandemic shopping,” Lower Merion resident Brian Gordon said. “There’s long lines, but people are really polite and sane. Montgomery County is functioning well.”

Another shopper headed straight to the gym after her shopping.

“It closes tomorrow so it will be my last night at the gym,” Jill Diamond said. “So I’m looking forward to seeing my friends and then I don’t know what, I’ll take a lot of walks.”

Any state employee traveling in and out of Montgomery County is now being directed to work remotely.

Wolf is also encouraging large gatherings to be canceled or postponed; discouraging people from going to recreational activities in public places; and asking religious leaders to use their discretion to prevent the spread of the virus through their congregations and their communities.

“These actions may seem severe but they’re far less draconian than what we have to do in the future if we don’t act now,” Wolf said. “We will begin putting this plan into effect for 14 days, beginning tomorrow.”

Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, also announced the banning of all big gatherings in the county.

“We, here at the county, are imploring our community to cancel non-essential public and private gatherings, both indoor and outdoor,” Arkoosh said.

She says the county supports the governor’s actions.

“We’re hoping to slow the rate of spread of disease and to decrease the ultimate total number of individuals who are impacted,” Arkoosh said.

Arkoosh also recognizes this will not be easy on county residents.

“We know that this is difficult,” Arkoosh said. “We urge you to continue to remain calm all week.”

Earlier Thursday, four more presumptive positive coronavirus cases were announced in Montgomery County, bringing the total to 13. The statewide total climbed to 22.

“We are not implementing any policies other than directives that are coming down from the state and federal government,” Board of Commissioners Chairman Sean Kertes said Saturday morning.

They are asking people to stay away from the courthouse unless you have to be there. County commissioners say jury duty has been suspended.

They are not allowing people to assemble outside in courthouse square outside the county courthouse.

“If you have to come here for court or other mandated things we understand that but if you can find a way to stay home and not come here. We would rather you not enter the building,” Kertes said.

As for testing, Excela Health Chief Medical Officer Doctor Carol Fox said there are limited tests available in their region.

“With that said, we are collaborating very closely with the dept of health and their epidemiologist to ensure individuals who need testing can get testing,” she said.

They are asking people who feel they may need to be tested to reach out to their primary care doctor to get the process started.

At the conference, County leaders addressed the special election that is scheduled for Tuesday. It is still one. They will have the machines wiped down after each person.

At this point, they are not imposing a large group bans like we’ve seen in other communities. They are recommending to follow what the governor has said about social distancing and his limiting of groups.",state_of_emergency,362437
Rhode Island,Newport,43914.72361,https://patch.com/rhode-island/newport/coronavirus-newport-state-emergency-extended,Coronavirus In Newport: State Of Emergency Extended,"NEWPORT, RI — The City of Newport has extended its state of emergency for an additional 30 days to help address the coronavirus pandemic. The City Council approved the measure unanimously in a special, remote session on Monday.

The state of emergency was declared during a special Newport City Council session on March 15.

In addition, the city government is asking all out-of-state travelers and seasonal residents coming into the city to self-quarantine for 14 days. In particular, part-time residents from New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Massachusetts coming to their Newport homes are asked to stay at home and self-monitor for symptoms to help slow the spread of the virus.

""With a large population of seasonal and part-time residents, we are acutely aware of the potential for community spread associated with interstate travel,"" the city said in a release.

This week, the Rhode Island Department of Health said most new cases are connected with domestic travel rather than international travel, and Governor Gina Raimondo has called for anyone flying into the state to self-quarantine. National Guard members have been stationed inside T.F. Green Airport to greet incoming travelers and collect information to help with contact tracing.

Newport's stay-at-home recommendation remains voluntary at this time, unlike Block Island, which called for an island-wide shelter-in-place on Monday.

""While the City currently does not have any plans to issue a formal stay-in-place order, we are continuing to respond to guidance provided by the Rhode Island Department of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Governor's Office and further restrictions are possible,"" the city said.

Newport residents are reminded that all close-contact businesses, such as nail salons, gyms and movie theaters are closed following an executive order from the governor. The city's public recreation facilities such as basketball courts and playgrounds have also been shut down for the time being.

Beaches remain open at this time, though the city said officials will""be vigilant in monitoring"" for gatherings of 10 people or more.

The declarations came two days after the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control announced that three people in Beaufort County had tested positive for the virus and were in isolation.

DHEC said two of the people “are close contacts of each other and had known exposure to a confirmed case of COVID-19 from another state.” The third person “has no known connection to any other case and recently traveled internationally.”

DHEC representatives did not immediately respond to requests for updates on the cases Monday.

The Beaufort County state of emergency, approved unanimously Monday by County Council, allows county administrator Ashley Jacobs the authority to “take any necessary actions for protections of the health, safety and welfare of Beaufort County citizens,” according to the ordinance.

The actions noted in the ordinance are:

• Utilize all available resources of county and municipal government as reasonably necessary to cope with the COVID-19 emergency.

• Transfer the direction, personnel or functions of county departments, agencies, etc., as needed for purposes of facilitating or performing emergency services.

• Contract, requisition and compensate for goods and services from private sources.

• Prescribe routes, modes of transportation and destinations in connection with evacuations or relocations.

• Suspend or limit nonemergency activities and prohibit public assemblies,

Jacobs said Monday that county funds used under the declaration are eligible for state recompensation.

The state of emergency is in place until May 16.

Bluffton introduced its COVID-19 Operations Plan on Monday. A news release said its primary goal is to “minimize exposure between Town of Bluffton staff and the public.”

As of Monday, the town will remain open with reduced staff and functions. All public meetings are canceled, as is Bluffton Municipal Court. All municipal court cases scheduled for March 24 will be rescheduled.

The town is encouraging the public to use electronic payment methods. Business licenses can be renewed and accommodations tax and hospitality tax payments can be made on the town’s website: www.townofbluffton.sc.gov. The public can email forms, questions and applications to BusinessLicense@townofbluffton.com. Questions concerning payments can also be directed to 843-706-4501.

Town parks will remain open but public restrooms may be closed for cleaning and based on town staff resources.

News and updates can be found on the town’s Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages.

The public can be added to the town’s distribution list and receive all of its media releases and meeting notices. Sign up through the town website or email public information officer Debbie Szpanka at dszpanka@townofbluffton.com and ask to be added to the mailing list.

The lead agency in the state during a public health emergency is DHEC, which works closely with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Coronavirus updates, news and guidelines on the disease can be found at scdhec.gov and cdc.gov.

According to DHEC, there were 33 confirmed cases of the virus in the state as of Monday, compared to 29 on Sunday and 13 on Friday. One of the cases resulted in the state’s first coronavirus-caused death, an elderly person in Lexington County.

“We emphasize the importance of practicing disease prevention measures and following recommendations for social distancing to protect our community as a whole,” Dr. Brannon Traxler, a DHEC physician consultant, said in a news release.

The release said people with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath should call their healthcare provider. If an individual doesn’t have a primary care physician, several health care systems are providing telehealth services so residents may be evaluated by a provider without having to leave their homes.

If it’s determined an individual should be tested, they will be instructed where to go to be tested. Individuals with minor illness are advised not to go to emergency departments, the release said.

Beaufort Memorial Hospital posted a news release Sunday asking for patients or loved ones to call ahead in the event that they have a fever, cough and shortness of breath.

“Your doctor's office will ask you a few questions and then give you appropriate instructions, which may include coming to their office for care or reporting to another site to receive rapid influenza and strep tests,” the post said.

“In some cases, patients may be asked to wait in their cars while a medical provider administers and processes the tests. Patients may be given additional instructions to receive Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) testing.”

Patients must have a physician’s order before receiving a COVID-19 test.

Patients who are sick and concerned about COVID-19 can initiate a video visit with a provider using the BMH Care Anywhere app.

Over the weekend, the hospital opened a drive-thru testing site for patients who have a physician order for a COVID-19 test.

The testing site near the Beaufort Memorial Medical and Administrative Center at 990 Ribaut Rd. in Beaufort is directly across from the hospital. It will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday and 1-5 p.m. Sunday.

On Monday, hospital representatives did not provide comment when asked for an update regarding the status of four staff members who were in self-quarantine after having contact with two people undergoing testing for the coronavirus.

Spokesperson Courtney McDermott said Saturday the hospital would not confirm if the Beaufort County cases were among those it sent to DHEC for testing.

The hospital has the following visitor restrictions in place:

• Only immediate family members over age 18 are allowed to visit patients.

• Only one visitor per patient is allowed. Additional visitors should not come to the hospital.

• Groups of visitors “taking turns” in and out of a patient’s room will not be permitted.

• Visitors with any symptoms of illness will not be allowed to visit patients or patient care areas.

The restrictions will remain in place until further notice.

Hilton Head Regional Healthcare currently has similar restrictions in place:

• No visits from children under the age of 18.

• Visitation is limited to one visitor per patient.

• No visits from people with fever or symptoms of lower respiratory illness, such as cough or shortness of breath.

• No visits to any patient who is being tested or has a confirmed case of COVID-19.

For prevention, the public is reminded to wash their hands frequently, cover coughs with an elbow, stay home when sick, don’t attend public gatherings, and appropriately dispose tissues and other items with germs on them.",state_of_emergency,171838

The City of Charleston is attempting to ""flatten the curve"" with ordinances and closures

Charleston City Council passed a citywide stay at home ordinance at a council meeting on March 24.

There are currently over 300 cases of COVID-19 in South Carolina, 36 in Charleston County.The ordinance will require ""non-essential businesses"" to close and will direct citizens to stay at home unless making necessary trips to the grocery store, the pharmacy, or other essential services.All city services, including police and fire assistance, are still active, the mayor reminded attendants at the press conference.Tecklenburg also ordered the temporary closure of all city parks and playgrounds, joining the long list of facilities shuttered due to COVID-19.Council passed the ordinance in a 9-4 vote. ""I know this is very painful to a lot of business owners that right now can't move forward and do what they need to do,"" councilman Kevin Shealy said at Tuesday's council meeting. ""But, I believe we've got to do whatever we can to shorten that time period.""Councilwoman Marie Delcioppo voted against the measure, citing her concern that the city is moving ahead of the state. She also argued that labeling businesses as ""essential"" and ""non-essential"" is subjective. ""I feel like this is way jumping the gun and putting us in a position that is going to be very, very hard to manage and come back from,"" she said at the meeting.In a statement on Tuesday, Charleston County Council Chairman Elliott Summey said the county was not considering similar measures.“Charleston County does not have any immediate plans to follow course in the unincorporated areas of the County. The Governor, through Executive Order, has not allowed such action,” Summey said. “Therefore, the County will continue to follow the State's mandates in response to the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic.”DHEC announced on Monday that in S.C., coronavirus has reached its acceleration phase, the period building up to the disease's peak. Attempts to ""flatten the curve,"" or stop COVID-19's acceleration phase from skyrocketing, have led to closures of restaurant dining rooms, schools, and city buildings. An order from Governor Henry McMaster on March 13 allows law enforcement to, at their discretion, break up groups of three or more outside of a home.""Charleston is facing thousands of deaths — most of them unnecessary — if we don't stop the spread of this virus,"" Tecklenburg said at a press conference before Tuesday's meeting.

Please consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to GoUpstate.

The Spartanburg Area Chamber of Commerce is asking local governments to provide immediate tax relief to local businesses impacted by the coronavirus outbreak.

""Any reduction, deferral or any other form of relief will provide badly needed liquidity to local businesses and the thousands of families depending on their survival,"" wrote Allen Smith, president and CEO of the chamber.

The letter was sent Tuesday to all local government elected officials in Spartanburg County. It was signed by Smith and Wes Lehrer, chairman of the chamber's executive board.

Smith said the plea covers all taxes that are normally remitted, including hospitality and sales taxes.

Calling it ""an urgent call to action,"" Smith said local businesses from restaurant, retail, hospitality and other sectors have reported losses of 60 percent to 90 percent as people are urged to stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus.

""Local hotels have furloughed employees and laid off others,"" he said. ""Restaurant and retail establishments, if they are open, are operating at greatly reduced staffing levels. If there ever was a time to extend some relief, now is the time.""

Smith said local businesses are the heartbeat of the Spartanburg area economy.

""We have pro-business elected bodies all throughout the county,"" he said. Now is the time for elected officials to continue their streak of business and pro-job support.

""Every dollar saved is another dollar towards supporting the thousands of people who depend on local businesses to support their families.""

After the meeting, Mixon said he in a statement he appreciates the working relationship he has with County Council.

“We may have some difficult days ahead but I know the citizens of Sumter County are resilient and patient and we will all have to pull together until we are through this emergency,” he said.

What is the Coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more serious diseases such as pneumonia. DHEC is working with CDC to identify all those who might have been in contact with these individuals. These people will be monitored for fever and respiratory symptoms.

People can help to prevent the spread of the virus in the following ways:

wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. And, always wash your hands with soap and water if they are visibly dirty.

avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.

stay home when you’re sick.

cough or sneeze into your elbow or use a tissue and put it in the trash immediately.

clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

get the influenza vaccine.

For general questions about COVID-19 residents should visit the DHEC website at scdhec.gov/COVID19 or the CDC website here.

For residents concerned about their own personal health or are showing symptoms such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, please call your personal doctor or healthcare provider. DHEC has launched its Care Line. If residents have general questions about COVID-19, the DHEC Care Line is here to help. Call 1-855-472-3432.

Once completed, the initiative would generate up to 155 megawatts of energy near the towns of Toronto and Brandt. In October, the commission previously accepted a settlement agreement presented by Tatanka Ridge and PUC staff, with issues not addressed in the settlement, such as funding for decommissioning, risk associated with ice throw, cumulative sound impacts and the potential impacts to whooping cranes, were presented at an evidentiary hearing on Nov. 4.

The commission recently met to rule on those matters and deemed the project permit ready.

“I appreciate the work that staff and the applicant have done,” PUC Chairman Gary Hanson said. “The conditions both parties have brought us today, in conjunction with the settlement stipulation we previously approved, have cleared up most issues and resolved my concerns. I thank the parties for working together and accomplishing as much as they did.”

The scope of work calls for a 27,900-acre project area and include up to 56 wind turbines.

By: Dwayne Page

Some inmates incarcerated in the DeKalb County Jail have been given an early release under judicial orders in response to the spread of COVID-19 .

Several non-violent offenders including older ones with pre existing health conditions and those whose sentences were about to expire anyway have been released within the past week to make room should remaining prisoners become infected and have to be quarantined.

Jails across the state and nation are also releasing prisoners to lessen the risk of a pandemic outbreak among the inmate population. The decision locally came after a Tennessee Supreme Court order last week suspending in-person court proceedings until March 31.

“The judges have been good helping us getting the prisoners released that we need out. I met with the criminal court judges and the chancellor in Cookeville last Friday and that evening I met with DeKalb County General Sessions and Juvenile Court Judge Bratten Cook, II and we talked about the inmates we have here. We had some inmates in jail for non-violent crimes who were awaiting bond hearings, arraignments, etc. and others already sentenced who were close to completing their terms. We also looked at older inmates including those with pre existing health conditions. We didn’t want to possibly further endanger their health if someone came into the jail with COVID-19 so the judges did orders on those inmates to release them and we have been doing that since last Friday. We are only releasing inmates who are non-violent. Prisoners incarcerated for violent crimes including sex offenses, robberies, etc. will not be released,” said Sheriff Ray.

“We currently have 27 inmates in our jail and two or three of them will be released when their sentences expire Sunday. Since last Friday, we have only had four new prisoners come into our jail.”

For new prisoners entering the jail, Sheriff Ray said a protocol is being followed to monitor their condition and to keep them from exposing others in the event they should be diagnosed with the virus.

“We have a quarantine cell with three rooms where we lock down inmates who are newcomers to the jail. They go through a protocol and a nurse assesses them for five days to make sure they don’t develop a fever,” he said.

Sheriff Ray began restricting public access to the facility last week until further notice due to the threat of the coronavirus.

“Our number one priority is to prevent possible exposure to staff as well as inmates therefore we have placed the sheriff’s office and jail on a soft lock down which means that the general public is not able to enter the facility. The front door to the lobby has been locked. Anyone in need of an officer or services such as a warrant must press a button at the front door which will ring for a correctional officer who will meet you at the door to offer assistance,” said Sheriff Ray.

For all non-emergency issues please call 615-597-4935.

“Tuesday night church services and family visitations with inmates at the jail are prohibited except for online visitations and the inmate roadside litter pickup program has been suspended until the threat subsides,” said Sheriff Ray.

“Rather than an in court appearance, video conferences are being arranged for defendants needing an immediate hearing before a judge for certain matters such as bond conditions, etc.,” he said.

To keep the jail from being infected, regular wipe downs are being conducted throughout the jail and cell areas.

The pandemic threat has also created a lack of some menu food items and cleaning products at the jail as the supply from vendors has run short although a new shipment is expected in a few days.",None,19164

“Our priority is to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of our community,” said County Mayor Bob Rial. “The power granted to county mayors and county legislative bodies by the state Legislature is very limited in circumstances of this nature, but we continue to communicate and work with the governor’s office and various state agencies to control and treat the spread of the virus in our county.”

Rial said the COVID-19 virus has “generated a worldwide challenge that we must face in order to protect ourselves, our families and our world.”

The county mayor said he’s asking citizens to adhere to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines to limit exposure to themselves and others, and to blunt the spread of this virus.

“It has been our goal in Dickson County to remain ready and prepared to battle this pandemic and the challenges it has presented,” Rial said. “With all of us working together, we will meet this challenge. I ask for your continued support and prayers for all at this time.”

The city of Franklin will close down in-person dining services inside bars and restaurants at midnight Friday. The declaration will also close gyms and fitness centers.

Salons and spas are asked to limit operations to comply with CDC guidelines. Churches are urged to hold services virtually if possible.

Franklin Mayor Ken Moore has asked residents who are returning from a spring break vacation to self-isolate for seven days.

The city is working to set up designated pick-up parking spots for restaurants in downtown Franklin.

""While this is a difficult and uncertain time, the only way to stop the spread and save lives is to take strong action now. Williamson County currently has the second highest number of cases in the State of Tennessee,"" said Mayor Moore. ""The safety and health of our community are the City’s top priority and we appreciate everyone’s patience and understanding during this time.""

This is a developing story. County Mayor Jim Coppinger will discuss the case at a press conference beginning at 3:10 p.m.

Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state increased to 26 on Friday from Thursday’s total of 18, according to the Tennessee Department of Health’s daily virus update.

Davidson County now has the most confirmed cases — 10 — followed by Williamson County, which has 9 people with confirmed infections. Knox County also got its first confirmed case.

The latest jump in cases comes a day after Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee declared a state of emergency to accelerate the state’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. On Thursday, the total number of presumed or confirmed COVID-19-infected residents doubled over the course of 24 hours.

Earlier Friday, Chattanooga Mayor Andy Berke declared a state of emergency and some operational changes to city government to prevent the spread of the then impending virus.

At a press conference, Berke said the city would be suspending all event permits, establishing continuation plans to minimize working city staff, closing certain social centers among other preventive measures to encourage social distancing.

“What we know is one of the most effective ways to deal with COVID-19 is to reduce density through what they call social density,” the mayor said. “We are trying to figure out as a community how to make sure that happens.”

Berke compared preventing the spread of the virus to extinguishing a pan fire, but said fighting it after it’s become widespread is more akin to a kitchen fire. Accordingly, he announced a state of emergency in the city and an executive order creating new policies for prevention in the city including:

— Suspending all public access and activities at all Chattanooga Youth and Family Development Centers and Chattanooga Library branches beginning on Saturday, March 14, until further notice.

— Postponing events at the Tivoli Theatre, Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Auditorium, Walker Theatre and Finley Stadium until further notice.

— Suspending all public access and activities at the Eastgate Senior Center and cancel all city-sponsored senior activities until further notice.

(WATE) — In response to combatting the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), city Mayor Indya Kincannon declared a state of emergency on Monday.

The declaration gives “flexibility as needed to have legal and budgetary actions as needed as we cope with COVID-19.” The mayor also strongly urged people to stay home and practice social distancing.

In numbers released by the state there is one case of COVID-19 confirmed in Knox County as of 3 p.m. EDT.

City parks will remain open. Senior centers were directed to close by the end of the day on Monday.

Kincannon made the announcement during a joint press conference with Knox County and East Tennessee health and hospital leaders. Knox County Health Department Executive Director Dr. Martha Buchanan was also present at the press conference.

Some other key takeaways from the press conference:

If you are sick please do not come to the hospital unannounced. Hospitals need to do everything they can to keep their teams and other patients healthy.

If you’re not sick you don’t need to be tested. You should always start with your doctor. Call them first.

Call first. Call first to determine the best level of care. There will be facilities set up in the near future.

Testing: Knox County just started testing regularly in this community late last week. It’s not everywhere. It’s ramping up and getting established. There’s some variability in where it’s available. We are testing a limited number of people.

Senior Centers: All senior centers will be shut down effective Monday. They will not be open tomorrow.

Restaurants: All restaurants are encouraged to use takeout and delivery services, limit seating to 50% capacity and separate any occupied tables by at least 6 feet.

Knox County Mayor Glenn Jacobs also spoke at the press conference.

“We have to keep in mind that we have to balance what we’re doing with ensuring public safety,” Jacobs said. “People have jobs. This will be a huge hit to our economy. We also have to keep in mind what is happening to the economy.”

Jacobs also issued a statement later Monday afternoon regarding COVID-19:

Dr. Buchanan also said at the press conference that there is a partial activation of the emergency operations center, which can also be activated for health crises. The city is working through the operations center to address people’s concerns.

Currently, Knox County and Knoxville leaders are encouraging people to stay at home and practice social distancing.

In regards to planning for the next steps, Mayor Kincannon said, “My mantra is ‘prepared not scared.’ Act in a way that protects public health. Public health is paramount. Act now; it does flatten the curve.”

Flattening the Curve

(source: CDC)

So, what does “flattening the curve” mean in regards to the novel coronavirus?

According to ABC News, flattening the curve is essentially introducing interventions such as social distancing, hand-washing, and lockdowns to reduce the potential spread of infection. The U.S. can flatten the curve before reaching peak case numbers similar to those other countries.

Measures that we all can voluntarily engage in, such as social distancing and hand-washing can have a tremendous impact, potentially negating the need for more aggressive measures such as a lockdown.

Officials said that the patient is currently resting at home, under quarantine, and that officials were monitoring them. According to a press release from Gentry, the Tennessee Department of Health was working to check if the patient was in close contact with other people.

Meanwhile, Gentry placed the county in a State of Emergency. The move gives the county more flexibility to combat the spread of coronavirus. New restrictions were also put in place to combat the spread of COVID-19:

The courthouse and Annex entrances are restricted to emergencies

Bicentennial Park and Eureka Trail are open, but the mayor said that use is restricted to no more than 10 people on the playground at a time.

No team games will be allowed at Bicentennial Park until further notice.

In-person court proceedings are suspended, following an order from the Tennessee Supreme Court.

“Madison County takes aggressive steps to contain the COVID-19 virus, including the restriction of public gatherings, bars and nightclubs,” Madison County Mayor Jimmy Harris said.

The announcement means Madison County can now take action officials deem necessary to ensure the health and safety of residents, employees and visitors.

As part of the announcement, Harris said restaurants and other businesses that sell food will need to operate at half their seating capacity, and bars will need to close.

“I declare and order in all unincorporated areas of Madison County, any bar or night club or other business establishment which derives more than 50 percent of its revenue from the sale of alcohol on the premises consumption, shall be closed,” Mayor Harris said.

That announcement comes only a day after the City of Jackson made the same call, closing bars and nightclubs and asking that all restaurants serve half the capacity of their businesses and limit the number of people inside businesses to no more than 100.

Harris also said that any person who violates the order will be cited for a misdemeanor violation.

Officials say it’s important to continue practicing the act of social distancing, as well as washing your hands to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“The main focus of this is to protect the health of our community, and it’s going to take all of us being a part of that solution in doing what we have been advised and recommended to do by health officials,” Mayor Harris said.

Get more information at CDC.gov/coronavirus or contact the Tennessee Department of Health coronavirus information line at 877-857-2945 from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. CT daily.

A state of emergency has been declared for Montgomery County over the coronavirus outbreak.

County Mayor Jim Durrett declared the state of local emergency Tuesday afternoon, giving the county the ability to waive procedures relative to “performance of public works and taking whatever prudent action is necessary to ensure the health, safety and welfare of the community,” according to a news release.

The Clarksville City Council will take up a resolution to declare a city state of emergency in a special called meeting on Wednesday at 3 p.m. in council chambers.

“What this would do is give me latitude on purchasing matters in the state of emergency, and also making sure our city employees are taken care of,” City Mayor Joe Pitts told The Leaf-Chronicle.

As of 2 p.m. Tuesday, there were still no reported cases of COVID-19 in Montgomery County, but the total number had risen to 73 cases statewide, up from 52 on Monday, mostly in Davidson and Williamson counties.

Limiting access to county buildings

Durrett has advised all constitutional officers and county department heads that public access to county facilities will be limited, beginning Thursday, March 19, through Friday, April 3. County offices will remain staffed, the release said.

Residents are encouraged to take advantage of online service options that Montgomery County offers at mcgtn.net.

All county departments have been directed to minimize staffing and create work shifts that separate supervisors and key department personnel. Shifts will work for one week at a time in the office/facility while the other shifts work to answer calls and emails from home.

The work environment will be cleaned prior to the next team rotating into the county facility. Employees who are sick have been directed to stay home and follow the CDC guidelines in seeking medical attention.

“This decision is not based on panic or fear but is a proactive step to ‘flattening the curve’ of this disease. I would rather be accused of over-reacting for the safety of our community than looking back in retrospect wishing I would have done more to protect the citizens of Montgomery County,” Durrett said.

What about local businesses?

“I am also requesting that the citizens and businesses of Montgomery County follow our lead and take proactive steps to prevent the spread of this virus. I realize taking some of these steps will be very difficult and, in some cases, may cause financial loss. Unfortunately, if we do not make changes, the long-term risk is likely to be much more costly,” Durrett said.

Many small businesses, including the food service industry, have or are formulating provisions for drive-through or pick-up options. Citizens are encouraged to continue patronizing all businesses in a way that minimizes social contact, the release said.

Durrett encouraged people to help each other whenever possible.

“If you are well enough and conditions require you to stay at home and a neighbor is working; please volunteer to do things like; mow their lawn, haul their garbage (wear protective gloves), pick up groceries or help in whatever way you can. Together, we will get through this.”

Public meetings

As for normal monthly meetings of commissioners, Durrett told The Leaf-Chronicle there is still much to be ironed out.

“We’re looking at asking our legislators to consider looking at legislation to enable us to post a call-in number for the public to use without having to attend our commission meetings in person through this period, and in a way that satisfies the intent of the open meeting law, but there’s nothing definite on that.

“In the meantime we’re looking at possibly cancelling a lot of our committee meetings and channeling all of their conversations through the Budget Committee, and again at the same time meet the intent of the open meetings law,” Durrett said. “But nothing has been firmed up on any of that.”

The city council meets in monthly executive session on Thursday, March 26, and Pitts isn’t relishing the thought of having Council chambers full of officials and guests with a coronavirus outbreak on everyone’s mind.

“State law requires that we can’t do telephonic meetings unless that rule is suspended, so we’ll have our meeting and try to limit the crowds as best we can,” Pitts said.

CDC guidelines

Durrett urged following the guidelines been set forth by the CDC:

1. Listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.

2. If you feel sick, stay home. Do not go to work. Contact your medical provider.

3. If your children are sick, keep them at home. Do not send them to school or daycare. Contact your medical provider.

4. If someone in your household has tested positive for the coronavirus, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work. Do not go to school. Contact your medical provider.

5. If you are an older adult, stay home and away from other people.

6. If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lung or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.

7. Even if you are young, or otherwise healthy, you are at risk and your activities can increase the risk for others. It is critical that you do your part to stop the spread of the coronavirus:

Work or engage in schooling from home whenever possible.

If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule. You and your employers should follow CDC guidance to protect your health at work.

Avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.

Avoid eating or drinking in bars, restaurants, and food courts – use drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options.

Avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits.

Do not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.

8. Practice good hygiene:

Wash your hands, especially after touching any frequently used item or surface.

Avoid touching your face.

Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow.

Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible.

Robertson County Mayor Billy Vogle declared a state of emergency Wednesday night in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

One case of the coronavirus, or COVID-19, was reported in Robertson County as of Wednesday. That’s one of 98 cases detected statewide, according to the Tennessee Department of Health.

The first case was detected in Tennessee earlier this month. Gov. Bill Lee declared a state of emergency in Tennessee on March 12, followed by President Donald Trump's declaration of a national state of emergency on March 13.

The state of emergency in Robertson County allows officials to suspend policies and request mutual aid help from other agencies, according to a Robertson County Emergency Management Agency news release issued Wednesday night.

Robertson County government buildings will limit access to the public through April 1 and will only conduct essential business. Robertson County Detention Facility inmate visitations will still be permitted because of its “non-contact video visitation system.”

The Robertson County Schools district, which announced Wednesday it would close through March 31, will provide meals for local children beginning March 23. Robertson County residents can find more information on the school district's website, according to the release. The school website is at www.rcstn.net.

Officials urged residents to use takeout or delivery services rather than dining in at local restaurants and avoid “taking drastic measures” in purchasing groceries. They also noted Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, including staying at home, avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people, washing hands and frequently disinfecting surfaces, among others.

“The next 14 days are critical and citizens must do what they can to flatten the curve, such as staying home if you can and not shaking hands,” the release states.

Though closed, the library will offer curbside service for holds placed online. The veterans service office will close to home visits. Officials encourage citizens to conduct any government services over the phone, according to the release.

Tennessee,Robertson,43915,https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/local/robertson/2020/03/25/coronavirus-robertson-county-mayor-gatherings-prohibited-misdemeanor/5082786002/,Robertson County prohibits gatherings of 10 or more; residents can be charged with misdemeanor,"Robertson County issued some of the strongest warnings in the state when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic with the Wednesday release of a new proclamation by County Mayor Billy Vogle.

Under the new proclamation, residents are “urged to shelter at home as much as possible,” all gatherings are “strongly discouraged,” and gatherings of more than 10 people are “now prohibited” until at least until April 1.

Any person who willfully violates the orders spelled out in the proclamation can be charged with a class C misdemeanor, the document reads. And since groups of more than 10 people are now prohibited, anyone caught in a group of 10 or more can now be charged, officials say.

“(People) should assume others are infected, regardless of whether they exhibit symptoms,” the proclamation reads. “Residents of Robertson County are urged to … practice appropriate social distancing (and) stay 6 feet apart.”

Social gatherings are defined in the proclamation as “any event or convening unrelated to essential services that brings together groups of individuals, including, but not limited to, community, civic, public, leisure, faith based, sporting events, parades, concerts, festivals, conventions, fundraisers and similar activities.”

Businesses are also similarly at risk of being charged if they do not follow the guidelines.

The proclamation specifies that all parks and recreation events, activities and programs are canceled; public libraries, gyms, fitness centers and museums are closed; and all restaurants, bars and similar food or drink establishments, including night clubs, shall not be open to people, except only to offer drive thru, pickup or delivery service.

People and business should take “particular care” to protect the well-being of populations that are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, the proclamation reads.

It “strongly encourages the public and businesses” to follow and comply with federal CDC guidelines as well as state and local departments of health.

Anyone visiting Robertson County is expected to adhere to the orders of the county mayor and Gov. Bill Lee, it notes.

The public is strongly encouraged to remain calm, resist panic purchasing, consider their neighbors who have need and to look after and help those most at risk, it adds.

“Our faith prescribes life, and life more abundantly,” it said.

The order remains in effect until 10 a.m. on April 1, but it can be extended in seven-day increments if necessary.

It was signed by Vogle on Wednesday, less than a week after the city of Springfield issued a ""strong recommendation"" for residents to shelter in place.

The orders, all issued or extended on Thursday, have similar language that closes or restricts bars, gyms, theaters and dine-in restaurants. (Each of the latest orders are embedded below in full.)

While the governor’s public health disaster — which bans gatherings of 10 or more people through April 3 — supersedes the city and county emergency declarations, the city and county can add additional restrictions or dates that go beyond what the state has limited.

In Bexar County’s case, Wolff added provisions to suspend evictions and foreclosures as well as forbidding price gouging. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg said the city would follow those provisions, as well.

Restaurants will be allowed to operate drive-thru, deliver and takeout orders for curbside pickup. Grocery stores, gas stations and other vital businesses will also remain open. Nirenberg said it was a tough decision but that stopping the spread of the respiratory disease known as COVID-19 is paramount.

Gatherings larger than 10 people are also still barred, with few exceptions.

For the state of Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order related to COVID-19 preparedness and mitigation. His order goes into effect at midnight Friday through midnight April 3, but it could be extended, Abbott said.

Where it mirrors Abbott’s, Judge Wolff’s order also lasts through April 3, unless extended.

His directions regarding evictions, foreclosures, price gouging, and specifically banning groups of 10 or more people within an enclosed space, however, would all last for 30 days.

The San Antonio City Council also voted Thursday to extend the measures Nirenberg had ordered the evening before for 30 days - or through April 19 - though they can be lifted earlier. It was originally effective for seven days.

Here’s what we know:

Businesses barred from operating

As part of the declaration, several retail businesses are closed. They include:

Bars

Lounges

Nightclubs

Taverns

Private clubs

Gyms, health studios

Indoor commercial amusement businesses

Bowling alleys

Bingo parlors

Restaurants and stores that violate the emergency order could pay civil penalties and fines, Nirenberg said.

“To be clear, the measures apply to the types of businesses referenced in this declaration. If they are not mentioned, the measure does not apply. Exemptions are also listed in the order,"" said Laura Mayes, a city spokesperson in a statement.

Businesses, locations that are exempt

Several places are still allowed to operate under the emergency declaration. They include:

Grocery stores

Gas stations

San Antonio International Airport

Public or private schools and child care facilities

""We've had our problems with the CDC, and how they've handled things, and we're not very appreciative of it, about putting our people at risk,"" said Wolff.

An individual was released from quarantine at a local healthcare facility on Saturday, had contact with others, and returned to isolation after a pending lab test came back positive for coronavirus.

""We're doing this out of a sense of caution. We e don't know a lot about this disease,"" said Wolff.

In his issuance, Wolff declared ""that ingress into and travel throughout Bexar County and the remaining 26 municipalities from Lackland by those persons that have been quarantined in the facility is not permitted.""

""They need to have someone pick them up and take them out just as they brought them here, and not expose our population to any potential problem,"" said Wolff.

The public health emergency went into effect immediately following the declaration and will continue for up to seven days unless continued or renewed by the Bexar County Commissioners Court.

Earlier Monday, San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg declared a ""local state of disaster and a public health emergency"" over concerns about the potential spread of coronavirus.

""Regardless of what the federal and state governments do, at the local level, we're going to do everything within our power to protect the public,"" said Nirenberg.

Nirenberg's declaration activates the city's emergency management plan and authorizes the city to ""commandeer or use any private property, temporarily acquire, by lease or other means, sites required for temporary housing units or emergency shelters for evacuees, subject to compensation requirements.""

""Our guidance from the medical community and what we've seen from medical professionals throughout the world, really is that we need to ensure that additional testing is done and that the quarantine period may need to last longer,"" said Nirenberg. ""These are Americans. We've been treating them and dealing with the situation in an extraordinary way, a compassionate way, and we also are going to deal with it in a safe way, because that's our obligation to the public.""

It also allows the city to ""take any actions necessary to promote health and suppress disease, including quarantine, examining and regulating hospitals, (and) regulating ingress and egress from the city.""

The declaration concludes by saying that ""no previously quarantined person shall be permitted to enter the City of San Antonio until further notice.""

On February 18, Wolff sent a letter to Congressman Chip Roy, asking that people quarantined for the coronavirus be tested at JBSA-Lackland rather than area hospitals. The judge later joined Mayor Nirenberg in issuing a joint letter pushing to keep the disease from going around San Antonio. The city leaders want to make sure evacuees stay under quarantine at JBSA-Lackland until it's confirmed they have the coronavirus.

""We have asked over and over not to transport these people into the city of San Antonio. They're not citizens of San Antonio, they're not citizens of Bexar County. We've asked them not to do that. They have totally ignored that,"" said Wolff.

Both Wolff and Nirenberg said that although the risk still remains low for the public, the emergency declarations are about being prepared.

""We're doing that with the guidance of our medical community so that people don't have to be concerned about going into the public. So people don't have to be concerned about visiting our city. We want to make sure that the risk of exposure remains low. And so we're going to utilize all of our authority to do that,"" said Nirenberg.

Burnet County Judge James Oakley signed an emergency declaration for the county due to COVID-19. Staff photo by Daniel Clifton

While some of the recommendations for slowing the spread of COVID-19 seem extreme, Burnet County authorities assured the public they are necessary.

On March 19, Texas Governor Greg Abbott emphasized the CDC recommendations by issuing a public health disaster followed by an executive order stating “people shall avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts, or visiting gyms or massage parlors.” He is encouraging the use of takeout or drive-through options for restaurants.

The executive order is in effect from 11:59 p.m. March 20 through 11:59 p.m. April 3.

“What you’re doing isn’t just protecting yourself, it’s protecting others,” said Burnet County Health Authority Dr. Juliette Madrigal during a special Burnet County Commissioners Court meeting March 19.

Madrigal explained that the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads three times greater than the typical flu.

Based on current information about COVID-19 gathered from other states and countries, Madrigal said the expectation is 50 percent of the general population will contract COVID-19.

The key to slowing the spread, Madrigal said, is limiting contact with other people and following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations outlined as of March 16. The newest guidelines recommend limiting social gatherings to 10 or fewer people for at least the next two weeks.

Along with the previous mentioned actions, Abbott’s executive orders:

avoid gatherings of more than 10 people

close schools temporarily

restrict access to nursing homes, retirement centers, and long-term care facilities unless a person is providing critical care

It is not a “shelter in place” order.

During her presentation, Madrigal explained that 15-20 percent of the people who contract COVID-19 would require hospitalization, while about 5 percent of those would need a respirator and intensive care.

Burnet County officials said it is inevitable the virus will make its way to the Highland Lakes, but slowing the spread could allow for a better response by health care facilities. The key, Madrigal said, is avoiding a spike in cases like what happened in Italy and other countries.

With a limited number of intensive care unit beds and respirators, a sudden influx of serious COVID-19 cases would overwhelm the health care system. Madrigal said Burnet County has only four respirators at this time.

Madrigal said the other 80 percent of COVID-19 cases would not require hospitalization, though some people might feel extremely ill.

While the disease seems to affect older people and those with underlying health issues, Madrigal urged healthier and younger residents not to get complacent.

She pointed out that the first cases of COVID-19 were first reported only about three months ago in China and there is still much to learn about the disease.

In Burnet County, about 20 people have been tested for it as of March 19, and there were no confirmed cases, Madrigal said.

If a person in Burnet County is confirmed to have the disease, it will be reported to Madrigal, who then reports it to Burnet County Judge James Oakley. Oakley said they will share that information with the public.

As more testing becomes available, Madrigal anticipates the number of confirmed cases in Texas to rise and for there to be some in the Highland Lakes. As of noon March 19, Texas had 143 confirmed COVID-19 cases and three deaths.

Anyone who suspects they have COVID-19 should call or email their doctor or other health care professionals before visiting a medical facility, Madrigal said. However, she added, if a person is struggling to breath or has other serious issues, they should seek immediate help.

Madrigal offered some good news during the March 19 meeting. She pointed out that clinical trials have begun on a vaccine for COVID-19, which is remarkably fast. Typically, it takes 12 months from start to finish before a vaccine is ready for public use, but Madrigal said she’s optimistic about this one.

“I expect this vaccine to be deployed much faster,” she said.

While there is much emphasis on limiting contact with other people, Madrigal said that doesn’t mean locking yourself indoors and shunning everyone. She emphasized the importance of getting outside with friends and family, remembering to limit it 10 or fewer people at one time.

“I want you to go for a hike with your daughter. I want you to go fishing with your son,” Madrigal said. “Get out in your garden. Don’t spend it all indoors.”

Federal, state, county and local governments throughout Texas have declared states of emergency and disaster over the last week in response to the growing outbreak of the coronavirus.

As of Tuesday night, there were now more than 4,200 confirmed cases in the United States, up from roughly 1,700 cases on Friday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

President Donald Trump declared the outbreak a national emergency on Friday, saying it will allow the federal government to be far more aggressive with its response to the outbreak, including greatly expanding the availability of testing.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also declared a state of disaster for all counties throughout the state on Friday.

On Tuesday, Caldwell County Judge Hoppy Haden amended a local state of disaster declaration issued the day before. The new declaration, which will last for 21 days, bars gatherings of more than 50 people.

“Due to some of the developments that have gone on over the last two or three days, and really all weekend, I have decided to ask commissioners to reduce the amount of people for mass gatherings,” said Haden, noting the order referred to social gatherings, planned or spontaneous, which would include restaurants, bars, churches and other areas where groups meet socially.

The order does not extend to grocery stores or places of employment that don’t provide venues or opportunities for social gatherings.

Haden said the declaration applies to all areas in the county, both incorporated and unincorporated, but noted cities within the county had the option to enact stricter regulations if they deemed it necessary.

Violation of the order is punishable as a Class C misdemeanor by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or 180 days in jail.

Haden said there were still no confirmed cases in Caldwell County, noting officials are closely monitoring the situation and will alter the stipulations of the disaster declaration prior to the end of the 21-day period, if needed.

At Tuesday night’s city council meeting, Lockhart Mayor Lew White instituted similar restrictions throughout the city.

“Due to the recent concerns over the coronavirus spread, several communities have begun the process of declaring local states of disaster,” said White. “I’m issuing that declaration on behalf of the city tonight.

“This declaration is not issued lightly. It’s issued in conjunction and in recognition of the action recently taken by the county in protection of its citizens and in the interest of the general public health.”

White noted the declaration bars all gatherings of 50 or more people.

“A gathering generally refers to a scheduled event or common endeavor where 50 people are present in a confined space, room or area,” said White. “The limitation on the size of gatherings shall extend to commercial, retail, wholesale, industrial, service, eating and entertainment establishments, with the exception of grocery stores.

“The representatives of such establishments shall be responsible for monitoring and enforcing the limitation on the size of the gatherings.”

The order does not extend to grocery stores or places of employment that don’t provide venues or opportunities for social gatherings.

Violation of the order is punishable as a Class C misdemeanor by a fine not to exceed $1,000 or 180 days in jail.

White noted the declaration will last for seven days. The city will call a special meeting on Tuesday of next week to determine whether the declaration should be extended and will continue to do so each week as needed.

“This requirement on the number of people may change if we start to the reporting of Covid-19 cases in Caldwell County, but as was reported today, there are none,” White said. “We do this in consideration of the public health, and we try to limit as much as we can the effect, especially on small businesses.”

While there have still been no confirmed cases in Caldwell County, Austin and Travis County officials confirmed the first two “presumptive cases” of the virus in the area on Friday, marking the county’s closest encounter to virus yet. The cases are considered presumptive after testing positive by state officials. They are then sent to the Centers for Disease Control for final confirmation.

Lockhart officials have reminded residents they have the option to pay bills online and at drop-off locations to limit face-to-face contact. The online payment option can be found at http://lockhart-tx.org/page/utility_home.

Two centrally located drop boxes are located at the front and back of City Hall — 308 W. San Antonio – and are checked twice a day. A drive-through location can be found at the Municipal Court Building, 1914 W. San Antonio St.

To mitigate risks associated with large crowds, Lockhart officials canceled all the spring break events scheduled at the Dr. Eugene Clark Library through March 31 and has indefinitely postponed the KIDFISH and Welcome Spring Day event that was scheduled for March 21.

Lockhart City Manager Steve Lewis added that Lockhart Senior Center is closed but is still providing meals through delivery. The food bank will still remain open, but only be appoint.

Lewis added, while not official, it appears likely the upcoming Lone Star Grand Prix kart racing will likely be pushed back to next year.

According to Lewis, the Lockhart Police Department has been taking some police reports by phone to limit face-to-face interactions when not necessary.

“If it’s not time sensitive or a critical emergency, we’re trying to do things over the phone,” he said.

During his address, Gov. Abbott told Texans on Friday there was no need to hoard or panic-buy supplies, though many stores in Lockhart have seen bare shelves.

To address the issue, HEB officials announced Saturday morning that stores throughout the state would be opening at 8 a.m. and closing at 8 p.m. to give overnight crews more time to restock important items associated with hindering the spread of the virus.

On Friday, HEB officials issued a press release stating the company was still in a strong position to restock shelves and encouraged customers to remain calm.

Wal-Mart stores throughout the country are taking similar measures, changing hours of operation nationwide to 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. to give staff members additional time to restock.

The city and county of El Paso have declared a state of emergency over concerns about coronavirus spreading throughout the world.

The declarations take effect immediately and were signed today by County Judge Ricardo Samaniego and mayor Dee Margo.

""We really want you to understand that the panic is not going to help,"" County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said. ""Our goal is not to close down anything but to be able to have a continuation of operations in the best possible way.""

El Paso does not have any confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Community members with concerns or questions can dial 211 for information.

Margo said the city and county are following the federal and state government's decisions to call for a state of emergency. The World Health Organization announced the spread of COVID-19, also commonly called the coronavirus, had become a pandemic.

""(The emergency declaration) opens the door for resources that would normally not be available to address concerns such as funding and restrictions on gatherings,"" Margo said.

Margo and Samaniego made Friday's announcement after using a section in Texas' government code that allows for a ""Declaration of Local Disaster"" due to a public health emergency. It is meant to help reduce the possibility of exposure to disease as well as control risks and prevent the spread of the virus.

""There is no need to panic,"" Margo said. ""There is no need to hoard. There is no need to go out and buy water or toilet paper or all the things that have been reported.""

The state of emergency lasts for seven days and requires a City Council vote to continue. It also activates emergency protocols and teams to respond to the rising concern over the virus.

The declaration allows for the city to adopt rules to protect its residents and declare ""quarantine stations,"" and emergency hospitals.

Under the declaration, the mayor is allowed to initiate directives to protect lives in the city. Members of the public are not being prohibited from participating in council meetings, and residents interested in staying away from rooms with large groups of people can participate by phone or online.

A threat assessment group, composed of regional agencies in the U.S. and Mexico, have met daily to share communications and information.

""As a region we've been meeting, discussing and preparing the city of El Paso along with our public and private partners such as the county of El Paso,"" Margo said. ""We are in total alignment. Our declarations are in total alignment. And, this is a joint city-county effort.""

Samaniego said a task force has been created internally to ensure the safety of employees, including sick leave. Employees with health issues should respond ""appropriately,"" he said.

County officials say the office of court administration has called for the postponement of jury trials and other county related activities have been suspended, including travel.

Hector Ocaranza with the Department of Public Health said residents can dial 211 with any questions they have about the virus. Ocaranza said protocols are being developed to ensure that elderly and individuals with chronic illnesses are safe.

He said four people have been tested in the area by the public health department. Guidance from the Center for Disease Control and the state provide guidelines for the department of health to determine who is tested, he said.

A physician has to recommend a person be reviewed for the coronavirus, Ocaranza said.

David Coronado, director of the city's International Bridges Department, said ports of entry remain open and his office is in contact with Customs and Border Protection.

The illness is a novel coronavirus first detected in China, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On Jan. 30, the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee of the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of the illness to be a public health emergency of international concern.

Data compounded by Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering on the city's public health department website says there have been a confirmed 137,445 cases worldwide. The data show 69,779 people have recovered from the illness and 5,088 have died from it.

In the U.S. there have been 1,268 confirmed cases, according to the data.

“We need to protect our parents, grandparents, and those who have chronic medical conditions,"" Minter said in the release.

Fort Bend County has nine reported cases of coronavirus.

“Minimizing the spread of COVID-19 is something that government officials cannot do alone. Enacting this order will protect our frontline emergency and medical personnel and those at higher risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19,” George said. “From The White House to our regional partners, we agree that this situation requires all of us, including the young and healthy, to follow and make sacrifices if our community is going to remain healthy and intact. We must listen to the science, data, and medical experts to ensure we do all that we can to flatten the curve and spread of COVID-19.”

Posted 9:23 a.m., March 17



Fort Bend County Judge KP George, in conjunction with Fort Bend County Health & Human Services and Fort Bend County Office of Homeland Security & Emergency Management, issued updated community guidelines Mach 16.

“The COVID-19 situation requires all of us, including the young and healthy, to become more disciplined and vigilant,"" George said in a release. ""We understand that these additional guidelines will impact day-to-day life, but COVID-19 is not the common cold. Each of us must make personal sacrifices if our community is going to remain healthy and intact.""



Among the guidelines, some new measures were put in place for workplaces and businesses. According to the release, spread from person to person can occur within 10 feet. These guidelines will be in effect until April 1.



With this, the county is calling for bars and clubs to suspend services or reduce hours and capacity while increasing the amount of time available for staff to clean and disinfect tables, chairs and bathrooms.



Restaurants are asked to limit service to delivery, takeout and drive-thru options instead of sit-down meals. Restaurants also have the option to decrease to 50% seating capacity to allow for social distancing. Patrons should avoid going to restaurants in groups greater than six and should use electronic payments to avoid handling cash and coins.



Employers are still encouraged to maximize

options. Other options include staggering start and end times to reduce large numbers of people working in the same space, frequently cleaning and disinfecting workspaces, and prioritizing protective actions for employees at higher risk of illness.



Fort Bend County had nine identified COVID-19 cases as of March 13.

At the March 24 regular meeting, Fort Bend County Commissioners Court voted to extend the county’s declaration of local disaster for public health emergency through March 31. On that day, the court plans to host a special meeting. Judge KP George said the county is still working on setting up two coronavirus testing sites but is experiencing issues in obtaining personal protective equipment.Fort Bend County Judge KP George announced late March 20 that gyms, fitness centers and any other facilities used for training, martial arts or sports must close in an attempt to flatten the curve associated with cases of COVID-19 coronavirus.Hair and nail salons, massage parlors, tattoo parlors, movie theaters, game rooms and bingo halls were added to the list of businesses ordered to close. The order does not apply to grocery stores, gas stations, pharmacies and banks, but these establishments are encouraged to comply with necessary precautions.George posted the following statement on Facebook around midnight March 21:""Scientific models and real life experiences from places like Italy, have shown without drastic action, the spread of COVID-19 from a small percentage of the population can exponentially rise. We need to 'flatten the curve' or use protective practices to slow the rate of COVID-19 infections over time and throughout the community, so hospitals have the room, supplies, and doctors for all the patients who need intensive care. We must slow the spread to make sure our limited ICU facilities in the region do not get overwhelmed. We also cannot risk our medical staff or first responders getting the novel corona virus. That is why, after the Governor’s Executive Order, I issued an updated Order in Fort Bend County to ensure more social distancing—the only known tool to fight community spread of COVID19.""This order will be in effect until April 3. Restaurants may still serve curbside, takeout or delivery options, including alcohol sales. Access to Fort Bend County offices and facilities have been limited to essential functions only.

Texas,Jack,43915.75139,https://www.jacksboronewspapers.com/covid-19-news-jacksboro/jack-county-city-jacksboro-declare-emergencies,"Jack County, City of Jacksboro declare emergencies","Jack County Judge Keith Umphress made a declaration of local readiness for a public health emergency on Monday afternoon while the Jacksboro city council declared a local disaster for public health emergency and order during their meeting in the same evening amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

The declaration from the judge states extraordinary measures must be taken to contain the novel virus and prevent its spread.

The declaration from Umphress declares a state of emergency for the county and the implementation of the county’s emergency plan for seven days. It does not add any further restrictions to businesses or residents.

Umphress shared scripture from 2 Timothy 1:7 on Facebook when he posted the declaration.

“For God will never give you the spirit of fear, but the Holy Spirit who give you mighty power, love and self-control,” the post read.

The Jack County Commissioner’s Court is set to meet on Monday, March 30, to ratify the declaration for a longer period of time.

Mayor Alton Morris serves as the emergency management authority for the city while Jacksboro Fire Department Chief Jeremy Jennings serves as the emergency management coordinator for the city of Jacksboro.

“Because this is a medical emergency then the one who would kick-off any type of emergency management plan would be the local health authority, (Dr. Robert Cooper,)” City Manager Mike Smith said.

The council weighed two options in which the Mayor alone could have declared an emergency that only lasts seven days or the council could declare a state of emergency for an indefinite amount of time.

The council ultimately decided to declare a state of emergency as a whole and the declaration will remain in effect until discontinued.

“The fact that Judge Umphress declared an emergency for the county, it covers the city, he has that authority,” Smith said. “However, if the city does not declare an emergency we will not be eligible for any federal or state funds that might come along to help us pay for anything we need to as a result of this emergency.”

The city manager said city hall will be locked to the public except by appointment, but they are still going to be accepting payments, although the public is encouraged to pay online if possible. Twin Lakes Activity Center will also be closed as part of the declaration.

Smith will be authorized to take necessary action regarding fees associated with utility billing including extending time for payment and suspending utility shut offs for customers negatively impacted by job loss or reduced income due to COVID-19 with documentation.

Smith said the police department can fine any violators up to $1,000 or place them in jail for up to 180 days, but he does not foresee those measures needing to be taken.

“We’re certainly not going to go out and start arresting people or writing citations because they are eating at JR’s,” Smith said. “I think for the most part we have seen people are policing themselves when it comes to that. But, certainly it gives us this ability to take some action should there be something really extreme happen.”

He added the declaration does not add anymore restrictions to businesses and activities in town than what has already been placed by Governor Gregg Abbott and President Donald Trump.

Abbot declared a public health disaster for the state of Texas on March 19 to last through Friday, April 3.

The executive order contains four parts: 1. Every person in Texas shall avoid social gatherings and groups more than 10; 2. People shall avoid eating and drinking in bars and restaurants, in food courts or visiting gyms; 3. People shall not visit nursing homes, retirement centers or long-term care facilities, unless to provide critical assistance; 4. All schools in the state of Texas shall be temporarily closed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported there has been a total of 54,453 COVID-19, or coronavirus disease 2019, cases in the United States resulting in 737 deaths. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported a total of 715 cases and 11 deaths in the state.

According to the CDC, steps which residents can take to help prevent the spread of the virus including washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer, avoiding contact with their faces, avoiding contact with people who are sick, staying home when sick, covering a cough or sneeze with a tissue and disposing of the tissue in the trash and by cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces.",state_of_emergency,8957

Restrictions on restaurants, bars, gyms and public gatherings spread beyond Waco on Wednesday as McLennan County and suburban cities declared states of emergency in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lorena, Hewitt, Robinson and the county passed declarations Wednesday, taking effect at 11:59 p.m. that day.

Hewitt and Lorena will close indoor recreation facilities like bowling alleys, gyms, bars and private clubs while limiting restaurants to to-go service and delivery. The cities of Waco and Lacy Lakeview adopted similar restrictions Tuesday, and Bellmead on Wednesday amended an earlier declaration to follow suit, taking effect immediately.

Robinson, Woodway and the county have opted to only limit the seating capacities of dining rooms. All have prohibited public and private gatherings of 50 people or more.

McLennan County Judge Scott Felton declared a local state of disaster and public health emergency for McLennan County, enacting restrictions that will apply to unincorporated areas. Under the restrictions, the capacity of indoor recreation facilities, bars, clubs and restaurants will be limited to either 50% of their capacity or 50 people, whichever is less. The declaration also prohibits events that bring together more than 50 people.

During a special meeting, the county noted that municipalities such as Waco retain authority over their domains.

McLennan County Judge Scott Felton said he had been in discussions with city managers in the area, and with a few restaurant owners, to get their feel of the situation.

Precinct 4 Commissioner Ben Perry mentioned he stopped at a small restaurant on his way to the courthouse, and there were as many people standing in line to retrieve their call-in orders as could have been seated in the dining area, so “mingling” is inevitable.

Perry said he counted 13 restaurants, most very small, operating within the county’s unincorporated area that would be impacted by the county’s emergency declaration.

Coronavirus latest: What's happening around Waco The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in McLennan County increased by three on Saturday, March 21, bringing the total to 16.

Hewitt made its declaration Wednesday morning. City Manager Bo Thomas said the state of emergency will last seven days, at which point city council and the mayor will meet and vote whether to extend it.

The decision came after Waco-McLennan County Public Health District announced five people in McLennan County had tested positive for COVID-19, a number that grew to six by day’s end.

“There’s a possibility there might be a person who works in Hewitt that may be one of those affected people,” Thomas said.

Angelia Sloan, city secretary for McGregor, said city officials will follow the rules outlined by the county and have not enacted more stringent policies.

Woodway declared a “local disaster emergency” on Wednesday. While the order won’t shutter restaurants, City Manager Shawn Oubre said most restaurants in town have voluntarily moved to takeout service only. The two restaurants that will keep their dining rooms open will limit their seating capacity to 50 people.

“I told them to help us, don’t let it get too crowded,” Oubre. “We don’t have big restaurants here, most of them won’t even sit 50 people.”

Oubre said Woodway is also canceling events booked at city facilities for the next 60 days and refunding deposits.

“Although this disease has not yet peaked for our area, state, or county, we must be vigilant and take care of one another. We are working diligently to slow the spread of COVID-19 in McLennan County and this declaration will provide necessary measures to do so,” a city press release stated.

The city of Robinson’s declaration limits the number of dine-in customers allowed in a restaurant to either 50 people or half of the restaurant’s occupancy limit. Indoor gyms and pools will close, along with the city’s community center, senior center, municipal court and Peplow Park.

The city of West has not yet declared an emergency, but closed its park, West Public Library, Little League fields, City Hall and West Community Center Wednesday. The West City Hall lobby will be closed to the public but staff will still be available to answer phone calls at (254) 826-5351, and process payments over the phone or online at www.payclix.com/cityofwest. The city also reinstated a juvenile curfew, prohibiting anyone 16 years old or younger from being out in public from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

The discussions started with the prospect of an event organized by C3 Presents. The company is behind big music festivals like Austin City Limits and Lollapalooza.

The company was originally planning for a festival on a ranch outside of Marfa to happen in May of 2020 with room for up to six thousand to attend.

However, the company initially backed off the plans after the community expressed concerns with safety, infrastructure and environmental issues. C3 Presents agreed in March 2019 that it would not produce the festival in 2020.

Now however the organization has obtained official permits for mass gatherings and outdoor music festivals, meaning the event can move forward.

There is no word just yet on what exact the group is planning.

No cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Williamson County, officials said. Austin reported Friday that three people have tested positive for the disease, presumably the first cases in the area.

Following the county’s declaration, the City of Georgetown also declared a local state of disaster on Saturday afternoon. Georgetown Mayor Dale Ross said the declaration allows the city to request state assistance if needed and to allocate resources, reorganize personnel, and enact procedures to prevent the spread of the disease in the city.

""Like our partners at the county, state, and federal levels, we are working to ensure the safety of our community,"" Ross said. ""Right now, that means trying to limit larger gatherings and making sure we have the resources we need to prepare and respond here in Georgetown.

Summit County Health Director, Dr. Rich Bullough, and Summit County Attorney, Margaret Olson, issued further Public Health Orders due to the continuing and immediate threat to public health from the COVID-19 virus. Officials say effective immediately, the Order addresses the following:

Gatherings of more than 10 individuals are prohibited. (Does not apply to critical government services or other necessary services such as shelters, residential care providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, or families living in the same household.)

Restrictions and limitations for commercial and residential building and construction work sites.

Restrictions and limitations to hair, nail and tanning salons, physical therapy clinics and services.

Protocols for dental clinical services.

“Every Health Order we enact is to protect public health in Summit County,” Bullough said. “We are in the fight against COVID-19 for the long haul. Each proactive step we take today saves weeks and months of reactive measures down the road. Our efforts will be magnified by the cooperation of our communities.”

Summit County officials say the Public Health Order will be re-evaluated in 14 days but does not currently expire until April 22, 2020. At that point, they say the Order could be ended, extended or modified.

This Order adds to a previous mandate on restaurant services that went into effect on March 15. Violations of the most recent Public Health Order are punishable as a Class B Misdemeanor in Summit County.

“This pandemic will not cure itself overnight, or over the course of a month,” said Summit County Council Chair, Doug Clyde. “We ask the public to aid us in our fight against the spread of COVID-19 by complying with these Health Orders to their fullest extent. These efforts require diligence and patience from every group in every community in Summit County. One person who thinks the rules don’t apply to them can endanger our vulnerable population and drastically set back our efforts with their irresponsible actions.”

Visit the county’s website to view the Order in its entirety.

Businesses, employees and members of the general public who have questions or concerns about compliance are encouraged to call the Summit County Community Concerns Line at 435-333-0050.

UINTAH COUNTY, Utah (ABC4 News) — Uintah County Commission Chairman Brad Horrocks signed a proclamation declaring a local state of emergency due to the negative economic impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on county residents.

“I have been speaking daily with business owners, hotel managers and others in our county,” the chairman said. “Some are already suffering significant economic losses brought on by the efforts to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and there’s no concrete timeline for when that might change.”

According to a release, Horrocks said the emergency declaration is an important first step towards assisting businesses and residents during uncertain times. It allows the county to provide applications for financial aid to local businesses, organizations, and families through agencies like Small Business Administration.

In addition, the proclamation allows the county to request and receive disaster assistance and mutual aid from the state and federal government if it becomes necessary.

Currently, Uintah County has no confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to TriCounty Health Department. There are currently 112 known cases of the virus in Utah.

Accomack County officials declared a state of emergency in the county Thursday, March 19, after the Eastern Shore Health District announced the first confirmed case of COVID-19 on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.

The Board of Supervisors met Friday via teleconference to ratify the emergency declaration made the day before by the Director of Emergency Management.

Chairwoman Reneta Major offered an invocation at the start of the emergency meeting, asking God to give the board of supervisors and staff “wisdom in this perilous time,” and to “intervene on our behalf.”

“We ask that you heal the land, God — only You can,” she said.

Accomack County Administrator Michael Mason said the ordinance to be approved was “substantially similar to some other jurisdictions out there that have adopted one.”

“We have to be able to continue government without having a typical quorum of the governing body present to conduct business,” said Cela Burge, Accomack County attorney.

The county is still subject to recording meetings, keeping minutes, and other requirements, including under the Freedom in Information Act, according to Burge.

Procedures adopted by the board of supervisors to ensure continuity of local government during the COVID-19 emergency include:

Meetings of the board of supervisors and other local boards and commissions may be held through electronic means, without a quorum of members physically present in a single location.

Any matter that requires the physical presence of the public in a county building that is closed to the public has been suspended.

County meetings may be held without the public being physically present, as long as alternative arrangement for public access is made, such as audio, video or telephone broadcast.

Where a public hearing is required by law, public comment will be solicited and received by written means before a vote, or may be solicited and received by electronic and telephone means, if it is practical and possible. Those comments will be provided to members of the board or commission and will be made part of the official record of the meeting.

The emergency provisions are to remain in effect until the board of supervisors repeals them, for no more than six months.

Additionally, all Accomack County facilities and offices, including the Commissioner of the Revenue’s Office, the Voter Registrar’s Office, Parks and Recreation, and the Treasurer’s Office are closed to the public starting Friday, March 20, and will remain closed until further notice. “We don’t take this decision lightly, but we’re following the recommendations of the governor and state health officials about limiting public gatherings to no more than 10 and practicing social distancing,” the county announced in a press release.

No in-person transactions will be conducted.

All county employees will continue to report to work during their normal work hours. The public is encouraged to use the county’s online options for payments and services as the majority of transactions and services can be conducted in ways other than face-to-face.

Visit https://www.co.accomack.va.us.

For assistance, please call during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.) at (757) 787-5700.

Additional information regarding options for conducting transactions with specific departments can be found on the county website, and at the entrance to the administrative offices on Courthouse Avenue. Landfill, transfer stations and convenience centers will continue to operate, but with limited interaction between staff and public.

All county-sponsored or supported events and activities are canceled until further notice. The decision to modify county operations follows the governor’s emergency declaration, CDC recommendations and the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation.

“We already have quite a few people telecommuting as of today…This is a very fluid situation,” Mason said of county staff.

“The public has been very understanding, and we will continue to adapt as we need to,” he said.

Major urged Accomack County residents to stay home for the time being.

“We can strongly encourage our citizens to stay put within our own jurisdictions. I know sometimes it’s tempting to go…Our citizens need to understand they need to understand, they need to stay within Accomack or Northampton county. I don’t think we need to be venturing out too much.”",state_of_emergency,33148

The declaration allows county or city officials to make decisions quickly about emergency actions that might be needed to help protect county residents and to allocate local resources where needed.

It also allows the county or city to access operational resources and funding from state and federal agencies. The President declared a national state of emergency on March 13, 2020, and Governor Northam declared a state of emergency for the Commonwealth of Virginia on March 12.

Augusta County leaders say they've been coordinating closely with Waynesboro and Staunton leaders to share information and resources.

The moves by Augusta County and Staunton follow Harrisonburg's declaration over the weekend.

While there has been one positive test for COVID-19 in a Harrisonburg patient and one positive test across the mountain in Charlottesville among the UVA community, at this point, there have been no confirmed cases in Augusta County, Staunton, or Waynesboro.

The local declaration of emergency was issued Thursday and is signed by Carroll County Board of Supervisors’ Chairman Joe N. Webb. Carroll County Interim Administrator Cellell Dalton said the emergency is a precautionary measure going forward that allows the county to access aid and resources, if necessary.

“This allows you to tap into state and federal aid, which is the foremost reason. If you have a local emergency, you can call the state and get resources to your locality if you need them,” Dalton said Thursday. “This is also in preparation in the event, as is typically a requirement in federal government, if we do spend any funds to address this COVID-19 (pandemic). As far as we know from the state health department, we still don’t have any confirmed cases yet.”

Dalton said business continues as usual in the county administrator’s office and most other county agencies inside the Carroll County Governmental Complex.

“People are still walking in. What we are doing is encouraging everybody to follow the governor’s and president’s recommendations to just stay home and stay away the best they can,” Dalton said. “Try to limit your travel and be done with it.”

The declaration of emergency reads as follows:

WHEREAS, in accordance with Virginia Code Section 44-146.21. that gives a local government the ability to declare a state of emergency to protect its citizens from current and potential emergencies: and

WHEREAS, The SARS-CoV02 (COVID-19) has been declared a world pandemic, and is a novel disease that has resulted in death to our most vulnerable populations such as the elderly and immune depressed; and

WHEREAS, Carroll County understands the economic impact that COVID-19 is causing not only on the national stage but the local economy and the risk to its businesses; and

WHEREAS, the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia have declared States of Emergency to protect their citizens, and to get more information out, as well as to move the proper resource to the affected areas; and

WHEREAS, Carroll County reinforces the guidance from the Federal government of reducing exposure by limiting the number of people in a group, using good hygiene and cleaning of high traffic areas, and social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and

WHEREAS, Carroll County will continue to monitor the ever-changing situation, implement county plans, and provide information to the public to further mitigate the spread and comfort its citizens from panic that could occur from such an emergency.

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY PROCLAIMED, the Carroll County Board of Supervisors declares that Carroll County is under a State of Emergency by the Director of Emergency Management, and the Emergency Operations Plan is now in effect on this 19th day of March, 2020.

North Carolina reported its first two COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday as local governments in several higher-populated areas ordered their residents to stay at home. Gov. Roy Cooper says additional state directives are coming to slow the virus spread.

Cooper announced the coronavirus-related deaths were a person from Cabarrus County and another person from Virginia who was traveling through the state. The Cabarrus County patient was over 70 years old with underlying conditions, while the Virginia patient was over 60, according to a news release, which did not include further details about them.

The deaths came as overall positive cases of the virus reached more than 500 statewide, according to a state tally Wednesday. About 30 people were hospitalized, authorities said, and some were in critical condition.

“Today is a stark reminder that we must take this disease seriously — all of us, young and old, employers and employees,"" Cooper said at a news conference while asking for privacy for the families of those who died. “This virus can be deadly, and that's why our daily lives have had to change so dramatically. I know it's hard, but it's necessary.”

More local governments announced stay-at-home orders on Wednesday, including the cities of Durham and Winston-Salem; Buncombe County in the Asheville area; and Greensboro and surrounding Guilford County. Mecklenburg County announced one on Tuesday that takes effect Thursday morning.

Wake County, which includes Raleigh and ranks No. 2 in population behind Mecklenburg, planned to roll out a similar order very soon, said county commission Chairman Greg Ford.

North Carolina government has not issued a statewide shelter-in-place order but has gradually reduced allowable gathering sizes, ordered some nonessential businesses to close starting Wednesday and shuttered K-12 schools until mid-May. Trade groups representing hospitals and doctors have written Cooper asking him to issue more statewide restrictions.

Without giving specifics, Cooper said further guidance and orders would be upcoming. He urged people to stay at home and businesses to get their telecommuting options in order.

“Local communities are doing what they think is right and I understand that. It's important for (state officials) to make sure we are deliberate and that we get this right,"" Cooper said. “We will be issuing additional orders soon.”

Durham Mayor Steve Schewel said at a Wednesday news conference that the city's order covering more than 265,000 residents goes into effect Thursday and lasts through the end of April. Similar to other jurisdictions, the order includes exemptions for people going to get food or medicine or completing other essential tasks. Schewel said Durham County has 74 cases, including at least eight cases of community spread. The area ranks among the counties with the most cases in the state.

“What we know about this virus is that it spreads easily and fast,"" he said. ""Once cases begin multiplying, as they have in Italy and New York, the rise in the number of cases is exponential. And that is exactly what we are trying to avoid and to stop here in Durham.”

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

The tighter restrictions came as General Assembly members held their first formal meeting to determine what lawmakers can offer to buttress the state's response. GOP House Speaker Tim Moore created four COVID-19 working groups, led by both Republicans and Democrats, that could recommend bills to the full legislature when it reconvenes.

The annual session is set to begin April 28, but there's been talk that the governor would call lawmakers back sooner. Cooper has said his administration is compiling legislative action and spending requests. Moore and one House colleague were the only members to attend the economic work group meeting in person at the Legislative Building, with the rest participating by video conference.

The speaker said chamber leaders were looking at ways to reduce the spreading threat should they reconvene. Moore said one way would be to expand the time period to complete floor votes, currently 15 seconds for the House, to an hour, so that members can avoid close contact with each other. The state constitution requires a majority of legislators in a chamber be ""actually present"" to complete public business.

""This is an unprecedented time in our state, and it's an unprecedented time here at the legislature,"" Moore said, adding that his chamber is prepared to convene before late April if necessary.

GOP Senate leader Phil Berger and Minority Leader Dan Blue said Wednesday in a joint statement that fellow senators would collect ideas with a goal of coming to a consensus with Cooper and the House on ""how to help all North Carolinians.""

We’ll continue to regularly update it. Any new information will be added below and included in our daily newsletter.

Latest: North Carolina has reported three deaths associated to COVID-19.

All city and county residents are now ordered to stay at home. The order is effective until April 16.

Known Mecklenburg County cases: 204. Mecklenburg has the highest count out of all counties in N.C.

Known North Carolina cases: 636, according to N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. The state identified its first case on March 3.

Deaths: 2 deaths associated with coronavirus. A Cabarrus County person in their late 70s with underlying medical conditions died on March 24. A Harnett County person in their late 30s with an underlying medical condition has also died.

Another person died in North Carolina while traveling through from Virginia. “It’s with a heavy heart that I must tell you these will not be our last,” Governor Roy Cooper said.

Stay at home order: The order requires residents to stay at home except for when they need to leave for “essential needs” such as grocery shopping, picking up prescriptions, going to a restaurant to pick up takeout orders, running or walking outside, or caring for a family member. Farmers’ markets, ABC stores, and Uber/Lyft are still allowed to be in operation.

The county attorney says that violators of the order could be convicted of Class II misdemeanor.

“The higher level of compliance we get with this proclamation, the shorter it will be,” said county manager Dena Diorio on Tuesday shortly after the order was announced.

School closures: On March 23, Cooper issued an executive order closing all public schools statewide for in-person instruction until May 15. The order also bans mass gatherings of 50 or more people, and temporarily closes gyms, movie theaters, barber shops, massage therapy salons, nail salons, and hair salons, for 30 days, starting March 25 at 5 p.m.

Community spread: County officials said for the first time last week that there was community spread locally — meaning they don’t know the source of the infection. Roughly one-third of the cases in Mecklenburg County are from community spread, officials said Monday.

“Want to emphasize that we have community spread,” County Health Director Gibbie Harris said. “Everyone should take it very seriously.”

More testing, more cases: The rise in known cases also reflects an increase in testing. The state says that it has completed 12,910 tests, which includes both state labs and reporting hospital and commercial labs.

According to data the county released Sunday night, about half of reported cases were adults ages 20 to 39; one case was a person under 19. The zip codes 28277 and 28205 — which include Ballantyne and Plaza Midwood/Noda, respectively — each have six or more known cases, according to the county.

State of emergency: Mecklenburg County is under a state of emergency, following a similar declaration by the state on March 10. In a local executive order March 16, Harris said all gatherings with more than 50 people are prohibited.

Zoom out: COVID-19, or just “coronavirus,” started in Wuhan, China in early December. Coronavirus is actually a large family of viruses that cause illnesses, including the common cold, MERS, and SARS. This present strain is new to humans, meaning we needed new tests and still need a new vaccine, which could take a year or longer.

Global impact: On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. Total cases are now more than 492,000 cases across 171 countries. At least 19,000 people have died and more than 111,000 patients have recovered.

United States: On March 13, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency. The U.S. saw its first coronavirus case in late January. Follow the spread in real-time with this tracker from Johns Hopkins University. Here’s where the virus stands as of March 26:

69,000+ confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country; 636 in North Carolina.

confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country; in North Carolina. 1,046 deaths. There has been 2 coronavirus-related death in North Carolina. Another person died in North Carolina while traveling through from Virginia.

Here’s everything else you need to know about how the coronavirus is affecting Charlotte:

What is North Carolina doing to control the spread?

Stay at home order: This is the latest and most drastic measure taken by the county and city to control the spread of coronavirus thus far. So what does it mean? The order requires residents to stay at home except for when they need to leave for “essential needs.” Here’s what you can still do:

Go grocery shopping.

Walk your dog or go for a run, but stay at least six feet away.

Pick up prescriptions from the pharmacy.

Visit a healthcare professional if you’re not able to access one virtually. Always be sure to call first.

Help someone get necessary supplies.

You can only go to work if you’re listed as an essential employee under the order. This includes medical providers, first responders, law enforcement, grocery store employees, food workers, journalists, and more. If you have questions about what this means for you, call the county help line at 704-353-1926.

Restaurant and school closures: Last week, restaurants and bars in North Carolina closed for dine-in customers, following a new executive order from Governor Roy Cooper. They are to remain closed until at least March 31.

Takeout and delivery orders are still allowed. Cooper’s order also includes an expansion of unemployment benefits to help North Carolina workers affected by the COVID-19 outbreak.

On March 17, Atrium, Novant, and Wake Forest Baptist announced that non-essential surgeries, procedures and ambulatory appointments are to be rescheduled.

“Rescheduling these appointments will minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 among patients, visitors and healthcare providers,” the hospitals said in a joint statement.

Visitor limits: On Monday, Novant announced a limit on the number of visitors to two per patient. On Wednesday, Atrium Health said that only “essential visitation” will be allowed for now. That includes visitors to patients who are minors, or who are in the intensive care unit.

Courts: Most cases and hearings in North Carolina will be postponed for at least 30 days.

North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Cheri Beasley announced the change at a news conference Friday. A 30-day delay for most civil and criminal proceedings will minimize courthouse visits in the hopes of slowing the spread of coronavirus.

Exceptions to this include:

Emergency proceedings

Trials already in progress

Bail and probable-cause hearings

How is travel affected?

On March 11, President Trump announced a ban on travel from most of Europe to the U.S. for 30 days.

Air: Carriers have responded to the outbreak by reducing their flight capacity and waiving change fees. Here are some details about their plans:

American Airlines, the dominant airline at Charlotte’s airport, is reducing its international capacity by 75 percent from March 16 to May 6. The carrier anticipates its domestic capacity in April will be reduced by 20 percent over last year; in May, it’ll be reduced by 30 percent. Out of Charlotte, American is suspending flights to a number of overseas destinations, including to London Heathrow Airport.

Delta Air Lines plans to reduce international flights between 20-25 percent, and trim domestic flights by 10-15 percent.

United is suspending travel to certain markets, including Beijing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.

American, Delta, and United are all dropping change fees on flights through May 31.

Train: There are no restrictions to travel on Amtrak. The railroad network, which has a stop in Charlotte, has scaled back approximately 40 percent of trains in the Northeast due to low demand.

How are schools responding?

CMS closed: In an executive order March 23, Cooper closed all public schools in North Carolina — including CMS — May 15. Cooper still wants teachers, staff, and administrators to get paid for the time.

Universities: All UNC System institutions, including UNC Charlotte, have moved classes online. Many other colleges have closed campuses and moved to distance learning.

No sports: The NCAA canceled its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments and March Madness. The ACC also canceled the remainder of its 2019-2020 season athletic events.

Full Agenda story: What’s the current status of schools in Charlotte?

Is public transportation still running?

Yes. Public vehicles are already cleaned daily, but the outbreak has prompted officials to take extra precautions. This is the city’s new contamination protocol for all 304 busses and 83 vans:

Crews are cleaning surfaces with a bleach solution.

A disinfectant fogger will be used on all 42 light rail vehicles.

Bus drivers and train operators are receiving latex gloves, hand sanitizer, and soap, too.

Starting Wednesday, public transportation on CATS will be free. Both buses and the light rail will operate on a reduced schedule.

What’s the impact on big events in Charlotte?

Sports: All major leagues currently in season have suspended games until further notice, including the Charlotte Hornets, Charlotte Checkers, Wells Fargo Championship, and more.

Blumenthal: All of the Blumenthal Performing Arts’ public events have been suspended until April 12 in response to Governor Cooper’s executive order. This includes Belk Theater, Booth Playhouse, McGlohon Theater, Knight Theater, and more.

Bank of America Stadium: The Rolling Stones have postponed their Charlotte concert, originally scheduled for July 1 at the stadium. The Billy Joel concert originally scheduled for April 18 has been postponed until April 17, 2021.

Religious services: In response to Cooper’s order, the bishop of the Diocese of Charlotte has mandated that Catholic churches immediately cancel all public Masses. Elevation similarly canceled all in-person services, and is encouraging attendees to participate online instead. Temple Beth El, the largest synagogue in the Carolinas, has closed its building. It’s conducting live-streaming worship instead.

Charlotte Convention Center conferences: Many large conferences are canceled or rescheduled. Local retailer, Girl Tribe has postponed its March 28 pop-up event at the convention center until June 13. It’ll still host a “Virtual Girl Tribe Pop Up Shopping Event” online March 28, though.

The Foundation for the Carolina cancelled its big annual luncheon on March 25. It’ll still honor sponsorship commitments, which were as much as $5,000 per table. Proceeds will support event staff and others “who were depending on our luncheon as part of their income.”

RNC: Organizers of the Republican National Convention say they’re monitoring the coronavirus outbreak but say they remain confident it won’t affect the RNC in Charlotte, which is August 24-27.

How can I protect myself?

You’ve probably heard of these preventative measures, but it’s important to reiterate:

Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.

Don’t touch your face.

Stay home if you’re feeling sick.

Avoid crowds of people.

County Executive Bryan Hill signed the declaration and the Board voted to approve it.

""This declaration streamlines and expedites Fairfax County Government's access to emergency disaster funding and it allows the county to use its authority to procure goods to address the emergency,"" Board of Supervisors Chairman Jeffrey C. McKay, said in a release.



Here is the full text of the resolution:

Whereas as the result of the potential spread of COVID-19, a communicable disease of public health threat, the Governor of Virginia declared a state of emergency on March 12, 2020, and directed local governments to render appropriate assistance to prepare for this event, to alleviate any conditions resulting from this situation, and to implement recovery and mitigation operations and activities so as to return impacted areas to pre-event conditions as much as possible; and whereas on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared a national emergency beginning March 1, 2020, due to the outbreak of COVID-19; and whereas cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the Fairfax Health District and the potential impact of the spread of COVID-19 is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant coordinated local government action to prevent or alleviate the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering caused by the existence of this communicable disease of public health threat; and whereas due to the potential spread of COVID-19, the potential for substantial injury or harm to the population necessitates the proclamation of the existence of a local emergency; and whereas the Commonwealth of Virginia Emergency Services and Disaster Law of 2000, as amended and set forth in Chapter 3.2 of Title 44 of the Code of Virginia, authorizes the director of Emergency Management to declare the existence of a local emergency with the consent of the governing body, now therefore be it resolved that the Board of Supervisors of Fairfax County consents to the declaration of local emergency by the director Emergency Management effective March 17, 2020.

Gloucester County Administrator Brent Fedors has issued a declaration of local emergency for the county.

Taken as a precautionary measure, the action is partially in response to the Statewide Declaration of Emergency declared on Thursday by Governor Ralph Northam in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The declaration allows for the full powers of government to deal effectively with emergencies or hazardous weather conditions, said a press release.

County officials are working with the Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Department of Emergency Management and will continue monitoring and preparing for the evolving situation, said the release. Local efforts are aimed at prioritizing the safety and security of all residents, it said, with additional focus on those who are most at risk.

Activities affected

Public access to all Gloucester County offices and buildings is suspended on Monday and Tuesday, March 16 and 17, to facilitate additional planning and preparedness efforts, said the release. Staff will report to work as usual.

The Gloucester County Board of Supervisors joint work session with the school board and the Town Hall Budget Meeting, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, March 17 and 18, respectively, are postponed and will be rescheduled.

All Gloucester County Public Schools will be closed for no less than two weeks, from Monday, March 16 through Friday, March 27, in response to the governor’s executive order.

All Gloucester County Parks, Recreation and Tourism programs are suspended until further notice, effective Saturday, March 14, including Tyndall’s Point Park History Day. County parks will remain open to the public for passive recreation.

Virginia,Grayson,,https://www.galaxgazette.com/content/grayson-carroll-declare-states-emergency,"Grayson, Carroll declare states of emergency","INDEPENDENCE — On Tuesday, Grayson County Administrator Bill Shepley, Independence Town Manager Reid Walters and mayors Richard Farmer of Fries and Bill Mitchell of Troutdale joined in declaring a local state of emergency for their localities.

This action will allow officials, emergency responders and citizens to prepare for the likelihood of COVID-19 extending into the Grayson County community.

Public access to county government offices and facilities is being strictly limited to those functions that cannot be handled by phone or email.

Any citizen needing assistance must call the office with whom they wish to do business. If you do not know the number of the office, call (276) 773-2471 for guidance.

If the service you are requesting is determined to require entry to the building, you will be met at the door to the courthouse adjacent to the main parking lot. This action is meant to maximize social distancing, reduce unnecessary public interaction and help to minimize the potential for spread of COVID-19.

Town government facilities in Fries, Independence and Troutdale are taking similar precautions to those of the county.

Public schools remain closed to students. “School officials and staff are continuing to develop extraordinary mechanisms for continuing to educate students while keeping them, their families and the rest of our citizens safe,” the announcement said.

Circuit Court and General District Court hearings have been continued until April 6. This does not include arraignments, bail hearings, protective order appeals or other cases deemed an emergency. Contact the Circuit Court Clerk’s office at (276) 773-2231; or the District Court Clerk’s office at (276) 773-2011.

The Department of Motor Vehicles office in Independence is closed, as well.

“We ask you, the citizens that make Grayson County the wonderful place that it is, to support us in these actions as well as following the recommendations of the Virginia Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,” the statement said. “We thank each of you for supporting our communities as we continue to prepare.”

Carroll County

The Carroll County Board of Supervisors declared a local emergency during a special called meeting on Thursday, in the wake of increasing outbreaks from COVID-19.

A proclamation issued Thursday afternoon stated that, while Carroll does not have a recorded positive case of the virus, the county “understands the risk and severity of this situation and continues to implement plans and provides information for its citizens to help reduce the exposure and possibly lessen the impact on the community.”

The proclamation also said that the county “understands the economic impact that COVID-19 is causing, not only on the national stage, but the local economy and the risk to its businesses.”

The proclamation continued: “Whereas, the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia have declared states of emergency to protect their citizens, and to get more information out, as well as to move the proper resource to the affected areas... Carroll County reinforces the guidance from the federal government of reducing exposure by limiting the number of people in a group, using good hygiene and cleaning of high traffic areas, and social distancing to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”

The county will “continue to monitor the ever-changing situation, implement county plans and provide information to the public to further mitigate the spread and comfort its citizens from the panic that could occur from such an emergency.”

Virginia Code 44-146.21 gives local government the ability to declare a state of emergency to protect its citizens from current and potential emergencies.

The Carroll County Supervisors Board Meeting for March 23 will now be held at the County Complex instead of at St. Paul School, as originally planned. County administration is requesting that the public not attend this meeting in order to comply with the governor’s recommendation of no more than 10 people at a gathering. The meeting will be live-streamed via YouTube.",state_of_emergency,15161

Loudoun County Administrator Tim Hemstreet issued the declaration in coordination with Loudoun County Board of Supervisors Chair Phyllis J. Randall.

The Loudoun Board of Supervisors is expected to formally ratify the declaration at its next business meeting scheduled for Tuesday at 5 p.m., the county government said.

The local declaration of emergency relaxes formal procurement requirements to allow Loudoun County to more easily acquire any goods or services needed to assist in the response to the threat posed by the coronavirus. The declaration also modifies normal employment rules so that employees can be reassigned to county operations involved in response activities.

A local declaration of emergency is sometimes a requirement for residents and businesses to obtain financial aid and emergency loans offered by the federal or state governments.



""It is critical that we remove any barriers to the county's ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Randall said in a statement. ""This declaration will give us more flexibility as we respond in the coming days, weeks and months to this public health threat.""

The declaration of a local emergency in Loudoun follows the declaration of a statewide emergency from Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and local declarations from other jurisdictions in the region.

The declaration also follows many steps the county has already taken to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, Loudoun County schools closed in response to the order from Northam for all schools in Virginia to shut down for two weeks. County libraries, parks and recreation, and senior facilities also have closed down.



Like every jurisdiction across the country, Loudoun County is encouraging residents to take steps to limit the spread of coronavirus, including:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer only if soap and water are not available.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.

Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.

Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

Stay home when you are sick.

Avoid contact with sick people.

Avoid non-essential travel.

Publix stores to have barriers for cashiers as virus spreads

The Associated Press

Publix says it will begin installing plexiglass barriers at cash registers to protect workers and customers from the coronavirus.

A spokeswoman for the Lakeland-based grocery chain says all of its stores should have the barriers installed within the next two weeks.

Publix has joined its competitors Kroger and Walmart in installing the so-called “sneeze guards.”

Grocery stores are seeing their business soar as authorities urge people only to go out for essentials, prompting them to stay inside and cook more at home.

Publix has more than 1,200 locations spread across Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

According to the Los Angeles Times, officials in the county, which is comprised of more than 30 cities, will hold a press conference discussing the new declaration later in the afternoon.

At least one person in the county has reportedly been infected with the virus, which has killed over a thousand people worldwide and infected victims in various parts of the world.

The move by Orange County to declare a local health emergency reportedly comes after Santa Clara County and San Diego County issued similar alerts earlier this month, in addition to San Francisco.

So far, officials say more than 50 cases of the virus have been reported in the country out of the more than 80,000 cases reported worldwide, according to CNN.

A number of pubic health experts have expressed alarm over the outbreak as some officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say the agency has begun to prepare for the virus to “take a foothold in the US.""

“Right now we're in an aggressive containment mode.” Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, said earlier this month.

He added that the virus “is probably with us beyond this season, beyond this year, and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission.""

Wendi Lane, a health emergency Coordinator for the Rappahannock Area Health District says one person in Stafford County was a presumptive positive for the virus that causes COVID-19.

The Virginia Department of Health is expected to provide more information on that case. RAHD will also be providing a person full-time in the Emergency Operations Center.

This comes as both Stafford County and Fredericksburg City declare states of emergency.

Both jurisdictions have urged their residents to quarantine themselves away from the public in the wake of the spreading coronavirus.

Meetings, public events, and travel by government workers have all been suspended.

In a press release, Stafford County Government tells Potomac Local News that the declaration lifts certain procurement laws to allow the County Administrator to take necessary actions during the declaration, and it provides local small businesses with the ability to apply for loans through the Small Business Administration.

It also gives Stafford County access to state mutual aid. The County’s Emergency Operations Center has been activated since last week and will remain open for as long as required.

“Declaring now puts Stafford in the right position to stay proactive and prepared during this unprecedented circumstance as the wellbeing and safety of our community and staff is our top priority,” states county administrator Tom Foley.

Stafford County has canceled all programs, events, classes, and meetings held at County facilities until March 31, 2020. The Board of Supervisors is currently scheduled to meet on Tuesday, March 17, 2020, at 12:00 p.m. only, and has canceled the 7:00 p.m. meeting along with public hearings. Staff will be monitoring the limit of 50 visitors and implementing social distancing practices.

The Stafford DMV Select, located in the Treasurer’s Office of the George L. Gordon, Jr., Government Center, 1300 Courthouse Road, Stafford has suspended all services from March 17 through April 2, 2020.

Stafford County has implemented a telework policy. The goal is to maximize teleworking and social distancing to protect employees as well as visitors without effecting Stafford’s level of service to citizens.

In Fredericksburg, officials say The declaration was issued as a precautionary security measure, which allows for the full powers of government to deal effectively with emergencies or hazardous weather conditions.

“We understand these measures are unusual and inconvenient to many, but we must look out for the safety and security of our citizens, guests, and employees. Some people may also be frightened or upset by the conditions in these times, but it’s critical that everyone remain calm, stay informed and follow the CDC’s safety guidelines,” said city manager Tim Baroody.

The city says it’s following the guidance and recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) to practice social distancing as part of a community mitigation strategy.

Fredericksburg will help with these strategies by:

Canceling all city-sponsored events and activities, including activities managed by the Parks, Recreation and Events Department effective immediately.

Employee work-related travel outside of the City of Fredericksburg, except for essential business, is being restricted until further notice.

The City is taking additional efforts to protect our employees, citizens, and guests by expanding cleaning efforts for all our buildings during the day.

The City will implement a compassionate billing policy for all Utility customers. Until further notice, no customers will have their water or sewer service cut off.

Individuals who dial 9-1-1 will expect to be asked additional questions as part of our

In a statement, Ballad officials stated “In an abundance of caution, in anticipation of potential community need, and due to the positive COVID-19 case reported in Big Stone Gap, Va., Ballad Health is moving aggressively to implement a regional COVID-19 surge plan for Wise County, Virginia – a move that can benefit and protect the entire region served by Ballad Health’s Wise County services.”

Other patients with health care needs not related to coronavirus will receive treatment at Norton Community Hospital.

“If any patients present with more serious needs than can be served locally, they will be treated at Holston Valley Medical Center in Kingsport, Bristol Regional Medical Center in Bristol, or Johnson City Medical Center in Johnson City,” the release stated.

While the emergency room at Lonesome Pine Hospital will remain open, all other services at the hospital will be transferred to Norton.

“Our teams at Lonesome Pine and Norton Community Hospital are committed to caring for our neighbors here in Wise County,” said Mark Leonard, Ballad Health VP and CEO of Wise and Dickenson Counties. “But being part of the Ballad Health network gives us the ability to rely on three high quality, nationally recognized referral facilities for support in Kingsport, Johnson City and Bristol.

The public is urged to follow guidance from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention and from the State Department of Health: “If you’re sick, stay home. Call your medical provider if you have trouble breathing or if your symptoms worsen. Otherwise, sick people should stay home.”

By Jessie Stensland / Whidbey News-Times

By Jessie Stensland / Whidbey News-Times

A run on toilet paper at grocery stores is perhaps the most noticeable visual impact the coronavirus has had on Whidbey Island, but that doesn’t mean a lot of activity isn’t going on behind the scenes.

There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus on Whidbey Island, health officials said late Thursday.

Nonetheless, the Island County commissioners formally declared a state of emergency March 2 for the entire county due to the worldwide outbreak of COVID-19, commonly known as the coronavirus. The declaration activates emergency management plans, allows emergency use of local resources and authorizes the use of emergency expenditures.

“This will allow for a more rapid response time in order to assist affected individuals to recover from the outbreak,” a release from the commissioners stated.

The county will also have a public health weekend call center to respond to questions regarding the coronavirus. The call center will be open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on both Saturday, March 7 and Sunday, March 8.

The number to call for information is 360-678-2301.

Erin Woolley, chief nursing officer at WhidbeyHealth Medical Center, said the hospital is prepared to respond to the virus and accompanying challenges. In fact, the hospital employs “an infection preventionist” and the staff trains to respond to all kinds of different health hazards.

“It’s what we do all the time,” she said.

Woolley said the hospital assembled a task force made up of medical professionals, public health staff, emergency management, the Navy and others to plan and prepare. Hospital officials are in daily contact with the Island County Health Department, the state Department of Health and other agencies to keep up to date on what’s happening.

The hospital conducts drills on how to isolate patients and collect specimens. Cleaning efforts have been increased and extra supplies have been ordered. Staff members watch webinars and listen to podcasts about the disease.

The hospital has trained a range of providers and staff on screening questions, which Woolley said is one of the most vital parts of the response.

Woolley explained people shouldn’t expect to see tents set up outside or many of the other visuals from pandemic movies. Even if the coronavirus does spread to Whidbey Island, most people will get only mildly ill and won’t need to be hospitalized.

“But we are certainly prepared if patients require hospitalization,” she said, explaining that the hospital has airborne isolation rooms which are used for other infections.

Doctors and nurses at the hospital aren’t wearing hazmat suits but are following the normal precautions for dealing with people who have respiratory symptoms. Woolley explained that the hospital follows guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control.

In addition, she said the CDC sets the parameters for when patients are tested for coronavirus.

A patient becomes a “person under investigation” and is tested if he or she has certain respiratory symptoms and recently traveled to a country with an outbreak; was in close contact with someone who tested positive; or is hospitalized without a different explanation for the illness.

The swabs may be a little uncomfortable, Woolley cautioned, since they have to go fairly deep into the nose and the back of the throat.

For accurate information about the coronavirus, the hospital advises people to check out the Washington State Department of Health website at www.doh.wa.gov/Emergencies/Coronavirus, the CDC website at/www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html or and the website for the World Health Organization at /www.who.int/emergen…/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019.

The San Juan County Council will be meeting on Friday, March 13 to declare an emergency in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

By declaring an emergency, San Juan County can fully employ all emergency response plans, utilize county resources and authorize emergency expenditures for the response throughout San Juan County. There will be no restrictions or closures included in the declaration.

“An emergency declaration is another step in our efforts towards ensuring all County resources are available as needed,” said Rick Hughes, Chair of the San Juan County Council.

As of March 12, 2020, there have been no confirmed COVID-19 cases in San Juan County, however, rapid spread throughout Washington state has increased the county’s aggressive planning and preparation work.

Chair Hughes said, “Our County has been working on emergency preparations since January and we have ramped up our efforts as the outbreak has progressed. This is a challenging situation for everyone, and we absolutely appreciate the ongoing spirit and energy of the islands and our citizens in the midst of so much stress and uncertainty.”

A copy of the emergency declaration will be available on the County website once officially approved by Council.

San Juan County health officials continue reminding everyone that if you feel sick and have mild symptoms, stay home. If you feel you have more serious symptoms or if you are at risk for severe illness, stay home and call your health provider. Do not visit a clinic or the hospital without calling first. Follow your doctor or health professional’s direction. If you feel the situation is urgent, call 911.

Washington,San Juan,43913.0625,https://www.sanjuanjournal.com/news/new-orders-for-san-juan-county-courts/,New orders for San Juan County courts,"Submitted by San Juan County Courts

On Friday, March 20, the Washington Supreme Court issued a new emergency order outlining required procedures in response to the COVID-19 public health emergency. As our state’s highest court, the Washington Supreme Court’s order is binding on San Juan County courts. In response to this new directive, San Juan County Superior and District Courts have amended their emergency orders to postpone almost all in-person proceedings. Amended orders are posted on the courts’ websites.

The Washington Supreme Court order postpones all civil and criminal jury trials until after April 24. This matches what was already ordered in San Juan County Superior and District Courts. Anyone summoned for jury duty before April 27 will be excused from service.

The new orders postpone all non-emergency civil matters until after April 24, unless they can be heard without the parties coming to court in person. All infractions and small claims hearings are postponed. Written civil motions that can be filed and considered by the judge without oral argument will still be considered.

Emergency civil matters, like protection order and no-contact order hearings, will still go forward; however, they must be held by telephone. Superior Court is allowing hearings in family law cases to occur by telephone. Adult Drug Court also will continue to occur, but by telephone only.

All criminal matters where the defendant is not currently held in jail will be postponed until after April 24. For defendants who remain in jail until the case is resolved, some hearings will still be conducted: first appearances, plea hearings, motions, and sentencing hearings will be held, but the court must allow telephone or video conferencing unless it is impossible.

Normally, the court will not change or reduce a defendant’s bail unless circumstances have significantly changed. The San Juan County courts acknowledge that the COVID-19 public health crisis creates a significant change in circumstances. Both Superior and District Courts will hear in-custody defendants’ motions to reconsider bail on short notice.

For any matters that still need to be filed with the court, both courts now have options available to file documents by email or fax, instead of submitting paper documents to the clerk’s offices.

Due to the number of people facing economic hardship during this crisis, San Juan County District and Superior Courts will not penalize anyone who cannot make payments under court-ordered payment plans. Anyone who misses a payment between March 16 and April 24 will not be found delinquent or in contempt.

Finally, as announced previously, the District Court Clerk’s Office is limiting the hours the front counter is open to the public to between 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Anyone who needs to file a petition for a protection no-contact order can still ring the bell for service during normal business hours, 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Anyone who needs to make payments for parking tickets, infractions, or court cases is encouraged to use the payment deposit box.

The Superior Court Clerk’s Office will remain open, but it has suspended passport acceptance and notary service. Everyone is encouraged to conduct their business by telephone, fax, or email if possible. Anyone

who comes to the office must remain outside the office so that staff can serve clients one at a time. Payments can be made electronically through OfficialPayments.com, by mail, or put into the Clerk’s drop box outside the door. Clerk’s fees for filing by fax and for presentation of ex parte orders are waived at this time.

Superior Court Administration and Juvenile Court Services offices are closed to in-person communication. Superior Court Administrator Jane Severin may be reached at 360-370-7480 and JaneS@sanjuanco.com. Juvenile Court Services may be reached at 360-370-7440.

San Juan County Superior Court, District Court, Juvenile Court Services, and the County Clerk want to provide access to the courts while acknowledging the severity of the public health crisis we face. It is our duty to minimize all in-person contact as much as we can to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to protect the public, court and clerk staff, attorneys, and parties. We ask for your help to slow the spread of COVID-19 by limiting your court contact to those matters that are essential at this time.",None,15875

They are asking people to stay away from groups of 50 or more, to avoid handshakes and to keep at least 6 feet between themselves and others when in public.

""Social distancing can be one of the best ways for us to combat the spread of this virus,"" said Snohomish County Health Officer Dr. Chris Spitters.

Officials are also practicing what they preach. Everett police canceled a Coffee With A Cop event at a downtown Starbucks.

So far, there have been 70 confirmed cases of COVID-19, a respiratory illness caused by novel coronavirus, throughout Washington state. Of those cases, 18 of those are in Snohomish County, including the death of one man in his 40s who was a patient at EvergreenHealth.

RELATED: Deaths and cases of coronavirus in Washington state

In Snohomish County, firefighters and other first-responders are being outfitted with gloves, masks and goggles for any calls they receive involving respiratory issues.

Fire officials said seeing a responder with protective gear is no reason for alarm.

""This is all about being proactive,"" said Bronson Pearson of the Everett Fire Department. ""We just want to keep our guys safe and the community safe. The more careful we can be the better.""

Public transit is now being more thoroughly scrubbed. Sanitation stations for hand washing are being set up in government buildings.

Because people older than 60 are especially at risk, senior centers in Lynnwood and Everett have been temporarily shut down as a precaution.

Health officials advised people to call their doctors before showing up at a clinic, and to avoid the emergency department unless they're very sick.

""This will allow our health care workers to remain safe themselves and focus on the most urgent cases more quickly,"" Spitters said. ""All of these precautions are recommended not mandatory. It's really up to the individual at this point.""

The county also encouraged employers to allow people to work from home. The decision to close schools is being left at a district level.

Despite the growing number of cases, and concern Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers said the risk of contracting the disease remains very low.

""The British have a saying, 'Stay calm and carry on,'"" Somers said. ""I think ours should be, 'Keep calm and wash your hands.'""",state_of_emergency,745913

Her condition improved and she was discharged. Since that time she has been self-isolating at home. She has no known international travel history, the health department announced.

“This positive case confirms that COVID-19 is circulating in our community,” said John Wolpers, an incident commander with the Whatcom County Health Department, in a briefing on Tuesday.

Citing patient privacy laws, health department officials declined to say more about the woman or where in Whatcom County she lives.

In response to the first confirmed case of what also is called the novel coronavirus, Satpal Sidhu, the Whatcom County executive, on Tuesday declared the public health emergency. He did so in coordination with the Whatcom County Health Board.

Declaring an emergency facilitates coordination with local and statewide partners, officials said, adding that it helps them provide a comprehensive Whatcom County response to the outbreak.

On Tuesday, the health department also issued new recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19, including canceling or postponing non-essential large public gatherings and encouraging businesses to allow their employees to work from home if possible.

It did not, however, recommend school closures although the department noted that decision is up to school districts in Whatcom County.

The Whatcom County Health Department was working aggressively to identify all those who may have come into contact with the woman who had the first confirmed case of COVID-19 here, officials said.

Close contacts may include family members, co-workers, emergency responders and others. Once identified, they will be closely monitored for symptoms to avoid further spread, the health department said.

“We understand that news of this first confirmed case in our community creates fear and uncertainty. Our public health team is working intensively to investigate the case, identify close contacts, and coordinate with our medical and community partners to protect public health,” said Dr. Greg Stern, Whatcom County Health Officer, in a statement.

“We are particularly thankful for the Whatcom County medical community, which has been in close communication with us about evaluating specific patients and implementing evolving guidelines,” Stern said.

Despite the additional measures people are being asked to take after the first confirmed case, Wolpers said that the risk to the public was still relatively low, though increasing.

To become infected by the virus that causes COVID-19, he said that people have to be in close contact with someone who is sick with the illness. That’s someone who lives in the same home, is caring for someone who is sick, is within six feet of someone sick with COVID-19 for about 10 minutes, or is in direct contact with respiratory droplets from someone who is ill.

Otherwise, you’re at low risk for infection, Wolpers said.

Health recommendations

So what should Whatcom County residents do now?

“We know that this is a difficult time for our community and these recommendations will significantly impact our daily lives,” Stern said in a statement. “The decision to make these recommendations was made based on the best public health science, which tells us that these actions are needed to reduce further transmission of disease in our area.”

The steps people are being asked to take are based on the increasing risk of the spread of COVID-19, Whatcom public health officials said, and match similar recommendations made by other health departments in the region.

They include:

▪ People who are at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places where there are a lot of of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others. This includes concert venues, conventions, sporting events and crowded social gatherings.

People who are at higher risk include those who are older than 60; have underlying health conditions that include heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; have weakened immune systems; and who are pregnant.

▪ As for public gatherings, officials said to avoid bringing together large groups of people — loosely defined as 10 to 50 people or more — if possible.

“Realistically there is no magic number,” Cindy Hollinsworth, the communicable disease and epidemiology manager for the health department, said Tuesday in the briefing. “The larger the group, the higher the risk of spreading illness.”

▪ Employees who can’t work from home should minimize their interaction with large groups of people.

Personal steps

County residents also are being asked to take these measures to help keep the respiratory illness from spreading:

▪ If you’re sick, stay home.

▪ If you’re sick with a cough and fever, don’t go back to work until 72 hours after your fever has gone away or seven days after the illness began, whichever is longer.

Employers are being urged to maximize their flexibility in sick leave benefits to accommodate these measures.

▪ If you’re sick with respiratory symptoms — coughing or sneezing — wear a mask when in public.

▪ Don’t go to emergency rooms or urgent care clinics if your illness is mild, so that health care providers can help those who have the most critical needs. Limiting unnecessary visits also protects health care workers and other patients from infection.

▪ Even if you are feeling well, avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities or nursing homes. If you must go to those places, check the facility’s rules for visitors before showing up, don’t stay for too long, and keep at least six feet between you and patients at all times.

On Tuesday, Skagit County also reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 in a resident there.

Skagit County Public Health said the person was a woman in her 40s who was in isolation at home, adding that she appeared to have acquired COVID-19 through community transmission.

More than 118,000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 4,200 deaths as of Tuesday evening, March 10, according to Johns Hopkins University. The United States has more than 972 confirmed cases with at least 28 deaths.

About coronavirus

COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019, is the name of the illness that first appeared in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, before spreading to other countries, including the U.S. It is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2.

The disease is spread through contact between people within 6 feet of each other — what’s referred to as close contact — especially through coughing and sneezing that expels respiratory droplets that land in the mouths or noses of people nearby.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it’s possible to catch COVID-19 by touching something that has the virus on it, and then touching your own face, “but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”

Symptoms — cough, fever, difficulty breathing — may occur two days to two weeks after exposure. Although most of the cases have been mild, the disease is especially dangerous for the elderly and others with weaker immune systems.

Information is from the Yakima Health District, the governor's office and state health officials. To submit a question, email news@yakimaherald.com.

What’s the latest on cases in Yakima County?

Yakima County had 44 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday. The Yakima Health District also reported the first death related to COVID-19 on Monday in Yakima County was an elderly resident of an unnamed long-term care facility.

From Friday to Sunday, the case count in Yakima County increased by approximately 150%, with about one-quarter of these cases among health care workers, the health district said. The local health district and the Washington State Department of Health are now investigating COVID-19 in two local long-term care facilities.

Cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed across the entire county and there is evidence of continued community spread, the health district said. All individuals with cough and fever symptoms should assume they have COVID-19 and stay at home.

Testing in Yakima County has been focused on health care workers and those who are severely ill.

What about the stay-at-home orders?

The Yakima Health District issued a stay-at-home order Sunday night. Gov. Jay Inslee followed with a statewide order on Monday.

The orders require that every Yakima County resident stay at home at all times except to obtain groceries, food and/or other necessities, to go to medical appointments, to pick up medical prescriptions or to go outside for exercise. Any time people go into public, they must ensure 6 feet of space between themselves and another person.

State health officials say the crisis has impacted every county in the state. People need to heed the precautions for the next two weeks, and the order could be extended beyond that if needed.

Yakima Health District spokeswoman Lilian Bravo said the main distinction between the two orders is that the statewide order is for two weeks, while the county order is indefinite due to the vulnerability of the local health care system and recent closure of Astria Regional, leaving the city of Yakima with only one hospital.

What authority does the Yakima Health District have?

RCW 70.05.070 says the local health officer has the authority to “control and prevent the spread of any dangerous, contagious or infectious diseases that may occur within his or her jurisdiction.”

Dr. Teresa Everson said the order is aimed at saving lives.

“COVID-19 has the potential to overwhelm our health care system,” she said in a statement. “This is a system that was already stressed with a recent hospital closure. Ultimately, the intent of this health order is simple: save lives by slowing the spread of disease.”

Can I go outside? Can my kids play outside?

Yes and yes. You can go outside for exercise, but you should maintain a social distance of 6 feet from others. It’s OK to go for a walk or hike, walk a dog or ride bicycles.

State officials said it’s fine if a family living together decides to go for a walk or take their children to play outside. However, people should not meet up with another group at a park or somewhere else. The city of Yakima and many area school districts are closing playgrounds to public access.

What can stay open?

Grocery stores, food banks, convenience stores, gas stations, pharmacies, banks, laundromats and laundry services. Restaurants are open for take-out, drive-thru and delivery only. Essential state and government functions will remain open.

The order also allows jobs that are part of the critical infrastructure sector to continue. That includes health care, emergency services, agriculture/food, energy, water, wastewater, transportation/shipping, communications/IT, child care, manufacturing that supports critical functions, financial and legal services, hazardous material management and construction jobs, according to the health district.

The state put out a 14-page list of businesses and organizations considered critical infrastructure. Non-essential businesses must close by Wednesday evening. Many businesses can continue operations using telework. For more on the governor's order, click here.

How will the stay-at-home order be enforced locally?

The Yakima Health District is relying on all community members and businesses to move forward with the orders as fast as they are able. They are prioritizing education first, enforcement second. The health officer has the authority to partner with local law enforcement and implement municipal fines at the health officer’s discretion. Non-compliance can be reported to 509-249-6508.

State officials said that police initially do not intend to go out and make arrests. They will disperse crowds. However, a violation of the state order is a gross misdemeanor. Authorities could get to a point where arrests could occur.

Yakima County Sheriff Bob Udell said Tuesday deputies do not plan to arrest, cite or detain people who are not in compliance. Law enforcement will instead aim to engage and educate those not following the rules.

""Law enforcement is here to help the community,"" he said, adding that there were no plans to mobilize the National Guard, except to potentially help with hauling supplies.

Washington,Yakima,,https://www.yakimaherald.com/special_projects/coronavirus/yakima-county-declares-state-of-emergency-after-first-positive-covid/article_dc7e1cc1-7b86-51f9-9d0d-4c5b54d7368a.html,"Yakima County, city declare state of emergency after first 2 positive COVID-19 cases","Yakima city and county officials declared a state of emergency Thursday in the wake of two confirmed cases of COVID-19.

City and county officials made the announcement during a special meeting, saying the declaration triggers the availability of state and federal emergency funds if needed.

Meanwhile, one local clinic said it had performed about three dozen coronavirus tests on Thursday alone.

County commissioners approved their declaration in the form of a resolution.

“This is a lever of government that we are pulling to receive government funds,” said Commissioner Vickie Baker.

Yakima Mayor Patricia Byers said the City Council will publicly announce its proclamation Friday.

Byers said the city will work with the county to address the outbreak.

Information updates will be handled by Yakima County Emergency Management and the Yakima Health District, commissioners said.

Under the proclamation, agencies will be able to bypass certain regulations and steps usually required for spending, contracting, borrowing and temporary hiring.

The two positive Yakima County test results came in Wednesday night, with the patients in their 60s and 80s, respectively. Each is recovering from the virus at home, according to the health district. They were not hospitalized.

Community transmission of the respiratory virus — which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic Wednesday — was “likely increasing at this time,” the Yakima Health District said.

Andre Fresco, executive director of the Yakima Health District, said social distancing is recommended. He said while the health district fully supports event cancellation, it was not mandating any.

The number of people tested in the county was not immediately available.

COVID-19 is caused by a virus named SARS-CoV-2, which is part of the same family as the flu and common cold. Primary symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. These usually appear two to 14 days after exposures.

Most people experience only mild symptoms. But some people develop more severe symptoms like pneumonia, which can be fatal. This is most common in those with preexisting conditions.

Two confirmed cases

The two patients with confirmed cases of the coronavirus were identified after coming in contact with a woman from Kittitas County who tested positive, as announced March 7. The woman attended an event at the Yakima Square & Round Dance Center in Moxee.

The eight people potentially exposed were self-isolated and tested for the virus. Two results came back positive, five came back negative and the last test is still awaiting results.

The district intends to contact individuals identified as having been in close contact with the two patients.

“While these are the first confirmed cases in our county, community transmission of COVID-19 is likely increasing at this time,” Teresa Everson, a health officer at the health district, said in the release. “As we see the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continue to increase in Yakima County and across the state in the next few weeks, it is important for everyone who feels sick, in any way, to stay home.”

The patients are among at least 457 confirmed cases statewide Thursday, according to the state Department of Health. The number climbed from 366 Wednesday. There had been 31 deaths as of Thursday.

Local scene

Fresco of the health district said it was difficult to determine the number of labs available in the county because there were several commercial labs now testing for the virus. He emphasized that the area was fully supplied with test kids, but could not provide the number.

Primary care providers throughout the county are able to conduct coronavirus testing, but individuals who show mild symptoms are advised to stay home and take care of themselves — there’s no vaccine and limited hospital capacity.

There were at least two commercial labs able to process the tests in Yakima County as of Thursday, according to reports from local medical experts.

Community Health of Central Washington’s network has tested “a handful of people,” while Yakima Neighborhood Health Services declined to provide a number. The Yakima Valley Farm Workers Clinic, which launched its own testing lab last week, tested about three dozen patients Thursday alone.

It’s unclear how many people have been tested countywide.

Lori Kelley, Farm Workers’ senior director of quality and patient safety, emphasized that all patients were welcome regardless of ability to pay or citizenship status. She asked that patients call ahead so the network could take potential coronavirus cases through separate doors or meet them to avoid infecting healthy patients.

Individuals are advised to stay home and self-isolate if they show symptoms, unless conditions grow serious — such as shortness of breath or trouble breathing, said Dr. Michael Schaffrinna, chief medical officer of Community Health of Central Washington.

“If you’re sick, stay home because testing is not going to change what we do with you,” he said, emphasizing that there’s no treatment for the virus.

What’s more, he said, the test has a high rate of false negatives in patients who show mild symptoms, which is the most common experience — meaning they could be falsely reassured that they don’t have the virus, and continue transmitting it if not in isolation.

The best protection against the spread of the virus is to practice diligent hygiene, frequently disinfect surfaces and stay home when sick, Kelley said.

“Certainly we’re all one community and this affects all of us, so we want to be sure we’re putting the word out to everyone in the spirit of creating a culture of health for our community,” she said.

Moving forward

Local health experts are continuing to plan in response to the arrival of the virus.

Asked if the former Astria Regional Hospital building might be used to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 or to host medical providers, an Astria Health official said the organization had a meeting scheduled with local officials next week “to discuss possible uses of the closed facility.”

CHCW’s Yakima Pediatrics is launching a car-side triage to evaluate children Friday morning in response to a high volume of calls that outpace in-clinic capacity, said Schaffrinna. The services will allow providers to assess children and determine appropriate care, including potential coronavirus testing, he said.

“It’s not a matter of if, but when we offer that at each of our sites,” he said of car-side services.

Yakima Neighborhood Health Services operated as usual, according to communication director Leah Ward.

Wisconsin,Calumet,,https://iwantthenews.com/Content/NEWS/NEWS/Article/Calumet-County-declares-emergency/1/1/35207,Calumet County declares emergency,"Effective immediately, Calumet County Administrator Todd M. Romenesko has declared a public health emergency in the county in an effort to guard against the spread of COVID-19, also known as coronavirus.

As of this Friday evening, March 13, there were no confirmed cases of COVID-19 within Calumet County; however, multiple cases have now been reported in neighboring counties, including Fond du Lac and Sheboygan, as well as other communities throughout the state. Because of this, county officials are proactively trying to minimize the effects of the virus locally.

Calumet County’s action follows Governor Tony Evers’s recent statewide emergency declaration.

The county administrator is recommending the following preventive guidelines for individuals, businesses, and organizations:

• People at higher risk are encouraged to stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible. Higher risk individuals include people 60 and over; people with underlying health conditions including heart disease, lung disease, or diabetes; and people with weakened immune systems.

• Visitors will be restricted from the Calumet County Jail.

• Per Wisconsin Department of Health Services, organizers of public gatherings with at least 250 people are recommended to cancel their events; however, many are adhering to a smaller threshold of 50 or more people to reduce opportunities for person-to-person virus transmission.

• Nonessential travel for all individuals is discouraged. Those planning trips should consider the risks versus the benefits, not only to themselves, but to more vulnerable populations.

Calumet County Public Health is closely monitoring and responding to COVID-19 information provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",state_of_emergency,49617

“It feels things are changing every minute,” said Superintendent Margaret Rudolph, who also advises families to follow Center for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on travel and disease prevention.

“I can’t tell people what they can and can’t do on spring break, but if they’re going into an area that’s considered high risk, we would appreciate them following the 14 days of self-quarantine,” Rudolph said of CDC guidelines regarding travel to “Warning Level 3 areas,” which are listed at cdc.gov. “Things change so fast and so if you’re not sure about what to do, please reach out to us so that we can plan for your child’s continued education.”",school_business_closure,56653

The “level 1” alert means all state agencies and key volunteer organizations like the Red Cross are in communication during the state of emergency, said Andrew Beckett, spokesman for Wisconsin Emergency Management.

“It reflects the need to make sure there’s large-scale collaboration and communication,” Beckett said. “It’s really just an anticipation and reflection of what we’re seeing.”

Level 1 alerts are typically used in statewide emergencies, such as the flooding of 2008, Beckett said. This is the first time the SEOC has issued a level 1 alert in response to a health-related incident.

Also on Monday, Dane County Executive Joe Parisi declared a state of emergency in an effort to devote more resources to slowing the spread of the illness.

Chief of Staff Josh Wescott said as much as possible county employees are working remotely and taking steps to reduce face-to-face contact.

Moraine Park

Moraine Park Technical College sent an email to students and staff on Wednesday that said the risk of COVID-19 on campus was low, but they have restricted travel for those connected to the technical college through the end of April.

The school ended all student and employee college-related travel out of state that is “non-essential” and all international travel until further notice. Personal travel was highly discouraged.

“As new information continues to emerge, Moraine Park’s leadership response team will continue to monitor, respond, and plan,” Moraine Park Communications said in a press release. “This includes deciding how the college will move forward with instruction for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester.”

Moraine Park said Friday in a release: “As of now, Moraine Park campuses will remain open and continue to provide services as needed during the extended spring break. Those who enter College facilities should practice social distancing where possible and continue enhanced hygiene efforts, as recommended by the CDC. Those who are ill should not come to Moraine Park campuses.”

STURGEON BAY - Door County leaders determined COVID-19 to be a public health emergency due to the risk to residents and the county's function.

The emergency declaration said the pandemic — if it reaches the area, as no cases have been detected in Door County yet — could impair transportation, food or fuel supplies, medical care, fire, health or police protection and other vital services and establishments.

Another key concern is the impact the virus could have on the summer's tourist season. At a recent Egg Harbor village plan commission meeting, several people remarked ""we don't know if we'll even have a tourist season.""

The summer brings in thousands of tourists to the area, and millions of the dollars to the county's economy, but people fear the pandemic will still be in full force as the weather warms, prohibiting visitors.

Declaring the state of emergency means the county will make it a priority to provide necessary resources to combat the pandemic.

Both the U.S. and Wisconsin declared a public health emergency last week.

Door County also implemented two temporary administrative orders. One grants employees impacted by COVID-19 additional paid time-off days. Parents of children attending any of the county schools — all of which are closed until April 6 under state orders — could take extra days off for this reason.

The other, the Employee Travel Administrative Order, restricts local government employees from traveling out-of-state. The county advised employees to cancel out-of-state trips. Employees returning from traveling must self-quarantine and stay away from their work site for 14 days.

If people travel out-of state before midnight on Wednesday, they can use extra work leave hours granted under the original ordinance in order to isolate. But if they travel after they date, they cannot use additional work leave hours but can work remotely if an employer grants permission.

Public safety employees are not covered by the travel order. The order urged meetings and other events be held virtually whenever possible to practice social distancing. Both are subject to change and will be lifted as the pandemic improves.

The County Board will hold an emergency meeting at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, at which time county leaders will provide more updates, according to County Administrator Ken Pabich.

KEWAUNEE - With the number of COVID-19 cases increasing steadily across the state, Kewaunee's County Board declared a public health emergency effective immediately at its regularly scheduled Tuesday night meeting.

The board passed a resolution declaring the emergency 15-0 with five supervisors absent.

The emergency gives the board chairman — currently Robert Weidner, who is not seeking re-election in the April 7 election — and County Administrator Scott Feldt ""... the general authority to order, subject to ratification if practicable, whatever is necessary and expedient for the health, safety, protection, and welfare of persons and property within Kewaunee County in the emergency.""

Feldt said that means he and the board chairman can make decisions without getting approval from a county committee or the board regarding county operations related to the pandemic and resulting restrictions on groups of people getting together mandated by the state. He said it doesn't extend to decisions on what otherwise would be standard county business.

""It could be a variety of different things,"" Feldt said. ""You could be dealing with any type of employee pay issues (if county services close or limit hours), closure of offices.""

Any measures that deal more directly with public health would be made in consultation with county Public Health Department Director Cindy Kinnard, Feldt said.

Feldt said there are no specific plans to enact such measures as of Wednesday morning. He noted any emergency decisions must be enacted in writing and published.

Kewaunee County had no confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Wednesday morning. Kinnard said at the board meeting that ""numerous"" tests had been conducted on residents, although 10 or 12 test results are pending.

Although exploration for a possible mine by Badger Minerals would be in southern Oneida County, just north of Langlade County, the concern is the possible pollution of the Wolf River, which runs through Langlade County and eventually empties into Lake Michigan.

The resolution calls upon the State Legislature and Governor to repeal Wisconsin Act 134, which streamlined the mining permitting process.

In a second resolution, the board unanimously passed a declaration of a state of emergency in Langlade County in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The declaration suspends governing rules and gives authority to a “Unified Command,” which includes the County Board Chairman, the County Manager, and the Public Health Director.

MILWAUKEE -- Two Milwaukee aldermen on Thursday, March 26 issued statements -- pleading with residents to take the coronavirus seriously, and abide by the statewide ""Safer at Home"" order, and the citywide ""Stay at Home"" order, issued by Governor Tony Evers and Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, respectively. This, with seven COVID-19 related deaths reported in Milwaukee County.

Gov. Tony Evers' order, which took effect at 8 a.m. Wednesday, March 25 continues until April 24, though the timeframe could be altered. It closed nonessential businesses, banning gatherings of any size, and imposing month-long travel restrictions in an attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

All public and private gatherings of any number of people who are not in the same family or living unit are prohibited. Evers previously limited gatherings to no more than 10 people.

Anyone who leaves home is required to maintain a 6-foot distance from other people as part of the social distancing effort that health officials say is the only effective way to slow the spread of the virus.

Milwaukee's ""Stay at Home"" order took effect at midnight Wednesday, March 25 -- closing all nonessential businesses. Mayor Barrett noted everyone can still work if their job is essential -- and everyone can get groceries, go to the doctor, even go for a walk if they practice social distancing.

""The more we can concentrate our efforts-- our community efforts into defeating this -- the faster our normal lives can get back to order,"" Barrett said.

It's up to local law enforcement to make sure people are obeying the new restrictions. The Milwaukee Police Department issued the following statement:

""At this time, MPD is still seeking voluntary compliance from our community as we fight COVID-19 together. We have been called to various individuals and business establishments regarding the ""Safer-at-Home"" order. The individuals we have come in contact with have voluntarily complied and/or dispersed. We will continue to educate our community and enforce the order as needed.""

Alderman Russell Stamper II and Alderman Khalif Rainey on Thursday issued statements asking that residents please abide by these guidelines.

Stamper II added that two of his friends have tested positive for the coronavirus, so this hits home for him.

Statement from Alderman Stamper II:

""The deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading fast among Milwaukee’s African American population, and it has already claimed the lives of several African American men here. But those deaths – and a strict citywide Stay-at-Home order – don’t seem to be getting the attention of enough people in the community. The coronavirus pandemic is deadly serious, and all Milwaukee residents need to start getting the message IMMEDIATELY! In fact, Milwaukee Police have indicated that they will begin enforcing the Stay-at-Home order where needed, especially when they see people congregating and conducting “business as usual” in violation of the order. MPD reports that problems with compliance have been especially bad on the north side, and even in 15th District. To be clear, on Monday (March 23) Milwaukee’s Health Commissioner issued the Stay-at-Home order, imposing a city-wide requirement to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The order took effect early yesterday and will continue to be in effect until it is extended, rescinded, superseded, or amended in writing. During the Stay-at-Home order, all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring outside a single household or living unit are prohibited, except for a few limited purposes. Nothing in the order prohibits the gathering of members of a household or living unit. All travel, including, but not limited to, travel on foot, bicycle, scooter, motorcycle, automobile, or public transit (except Essential Travel and Essential Activities as defined in the order) is prohibited. People riding on public transit (especially MCTS buses) must comply with social distancing requirements to the greatest extent feasible. People are allowed to leave their homes to engage in activities or perform tasks essential to their health and safety, or to the health and safety of their family or household members (including, but not limited to, pets), such as (by way of example only and without limitation) obtaining medical supplies or medication, visiting a health care professional, or obtaining supplies they need to work from home. Residents may also leave their home to obtain necessary services or supplies for themselves and their family or household members, or to deliver those services or supplies to others, such as canned food, dry goods, fresh fruits and vegetables, pet supply, fresh meats, fish, and poultry, and any other household consumer products, and products necessary to maintain the safety, sanitation, and essential operation of their home. People are allowed to engage in outdoor activity, provided they practice social distancing, and this can include walking, running or hiking. Games of basketball (and soccer) should be avoided because of the physical contact involved, and ALL playgrounds are closed and must be avoided to combat the spread of the deadly virus. People are allowed to leave home to perform work providing essential products and services (as defined in the order) and to care for a family member, friend, or pet in another household, and to transport family members, friends, or pets as allowed by the order. Lastly, residents will be allowed to travel to the polls to vote in the spring election on April 7 (or to work at polling locations or to count ballots). To avoid the need to go to a polling location, residents may still request an absentee ballot online at myvote.wi.gov or by calling 414-286-VOTE. COVID-19 is highly transmissible and is 10 times deadlier than the seasonal influenza! NO ONE is immune and there is no vaccine, and it can be especially deadly for those with underlying medical conditions and issues such as asthma, diabetes, heart and pulmonary disease, cancer patients and anyone 65 or older. I cannot stress strongly enough how important it is for EVERYONE to immediately STAY HOME and comply with the Stay-at-Home order so we can stop the spread of the coronavirus and protect the health of the community.""

Statement from Alderman Rainey:

""The global pandemic brought about by COVID-19 has caused the city and state to issue “Stay-at-Home” orders to help slow the spread of the virus. Alderman Khalif J. Rainey is urging city residents, particularly those of the 7th District, to take this order seriously and remain at home. “The orders issued by the city and state this week underscore how serious this health emergency is,” said Alderman Rainey. “I implore all residents to stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary to leave. I particularly want to encourage residents near St. Joseph’s and the Sherman Park area to abide by these orders, as those places have seen the greatest concentration of positive cases.” Beginning Tuesday, March 24th the Ascension SE Wisconsin Hospital - St. Joseph Campus was one of several Ascension sites to start offering drive-thru testing. All drive-thru tests are by appointment only. Individuals who wish to be tested must first be pre-screened by an Ascension Medical Group provider by phone (1-833-981-0711), or virtually using Ascension Online Care (ascension.org/OnlineCare). The “Stay-at-Home” order aims to ensure that the maximum number of people self-isolate in their places of residence to slow the spread of the virus. Residents should only leave their home to perform or obtain vital services. Among the businesses that remain open are grocery and supply stores, health care facilities and pharmacies, restaurants (take-out only), child care facilities, auto shops and gas stations. Should someone have to leave their home they should follow the appropriate precautions. Practice proper social distancing and remain six feet apart from other people, remember to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, cover coughs and sneezes, avoid touching your face, and stay home if you feel sick. The order went into effective at 12:01 a.m. on March 25, 2020 and will continue to be in effect until it is extended, rescinded, superseded, or amended in writing by the Health Commissioner. Those with questions related to COVID-19 can call 2-1-1 to speak with a health care professional Monday – Friday from 8:00 a.m. – 4:45 p.m. Visit Milwaukee.gov/coronavirus for the latest news and information.""

County Board Chairman Paul Bednarek had signed the declaration two days earlier on March 17, proclaiming a state of emergency through July 17 enabling the county “to employ and expend all available resources to protect the health, safety and welfare of persons and property in Oconto County.”

The vote was 24-0 to ratify Bednarek’s action, with seven supervisors not in attendance, in a meeting that was moved from the board chambers at the Oconto County Courthouse to the more spacious conference room at the adjacent Law Enforcement Center.

The board also passed a variety of more routine business items, including the election of Brandon Hytinen as the county’s new highway commissioner. Hytinen has been assistant highway commissioner under Pat Scanlan, who last month announced his retirement from the position effective April 3.

Salaries were set for the next four-year terms of the county clerk, register of deeds and treasurer, who will be elected in the November election.

The resolution – approved 23-1 with Supervisor Gary Frank dissenting – provides a 6.8% increase over the incumbents’ current salaries to $62,010 in 2021, followed by 2% annual raises for the next three years to $70,296.01 in 2024.

Evers made the move after state health officials announced earlier Friday that the number of confirmed infections had risen to 19, up from eight just a day earlier.

School closures must begin by Wednesday to allow districts time to make plans for students, families and staff, although districts can choose to close sooner, Evers said in a statement announcing the order.

“Closing our schools is not a decision I made lightly, but keeping our kids, our educators, our families, and our communities safe is a top priority as we continue our work to respond to and prevent further spread of COVID-19 in Wisconsin,” Evers said, referring to the disease the caused by the coronavirus.",school_business_closure,63162
