Jin Hai, a Chinese customs official, said on Sunday that nearly four billion masks, 16,000 ventilators, 37.5 million pieces of protective clothing, and 2.84 million coronavirus testing kits had been exported to more than 50 countries since March 1, AFP news agency reported.

His statement came amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese medical equipment from European countries such as the Netherlands, Slovakia and Spain.

One of the most affected countries, Spain withdrew 58,000 coronavirus testing kits purchased from a Chinese company on March 27, after it was revealed they had a mere 30-percent detection rate.

The Chinese embassy in Spain said the Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology group, which supplied the kits, did not possess any official license from medical authorities in China to sell its products.

On March 31, China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) said coronavirus test exporters must obtain a registration certificate before selling their products.

The Netherlands recently recalled tens of thousands of masks it said did not close over the face properly or had defective filters.

At a press conference on Sunday, Jiang Fan, an official with the Ministry of Commerce, said it was important to realise that China has different ""standards and usage habits to other countries"", AFP reported, warning if the equipment was used improperly, this could sow doubt over the quality of products.

Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic last month claimed that more than a million tests his country received from China should ""just be thrown straight into the Danube [river]"".

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying responded by saying problems should be ""properly solved based on facts, not political interpretations"", according to Bloomberg.

""In fact, when we first began fighting COVID-19 at home, some of the assistance China received was defective, but we chose to believe and respect the kind intentions of these countries.""

When the coronavirus infection spread in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, over a dozen countries including Turkey and France, sent humanitarian and medical aid.

According to Shirley Ze Yu, a political economist and Asia fellow at the Ash Center in Harvard Kennedy School, China should be more receptive, and less defensive, to criticism.

She said instead of ""refuting"" allegations of European nations, China should ""investigate domestic medical device manufacturers, and eradicate substandard or un-licenced production capacity within the country"".

China has built itself into the ""world's factory"" over the past three decades, she added, saying it would be challenging for any other country to match its manufacturing efficiency.

""China should use the occasion to clean out any speculative business activity that not only puts human lives, but China's global manufacturing reputation at stake.

""At the end of the global pandemic, not only world leaders, but all people all around the world will form a very personal opinion about China.

""China needs to understand that leadership is ... not about just helping 'friends' and allies, but all under suffering.""

Janka Oertel, director of the Asia Programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera: ""This crisis will be a defining moment for the future of EU-China relations - for good or bad remains to be seen.""

'We need to defend Europe against detractors'

A number of high-profile figures have alleged China is not acting out of humanitarian spirit but to implement a geopolitical vision.

Spain and the Czech Republic returned Chinese testing kits as EU Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said China was aggressively pushing the idea that unlike the US, it was a ""responsible and reliable partner"".

""We must be aware there is a geopolitical component, including a struggle for influence through spinning and the 'politics of generosity',"" Borrell said. ""Armed with facts, we need to defend Europe against its detractors.""

According to Oertel, Borrell's view was a ""pragmatic assessment"".

""Europe needs to show a much greater degree of internal solidarity,"" she said, ""but it also needs to be much clearer about how much support it is actually already giving and coordinating.""

But Hasaan Khawar, a public and economic policy analyst based in Islamabad, said China has established itself as an ""emerging world leader, and the West isn't entirely sure on how to respond to this new reality"".

""I do feel [Borrell's] comments on this issue are presumptuous and unfair,"" he told Al Jazeera. ""More importantly, these comments did not reflect the views of [all] member countries, as the countries that have been helped by China have been immensely appreciative.""

Italy, for example, has welcomed support from China and Cuba, unusual allies in a time of crisis, while EU members such as Germany refused to send equipment they may need for their own citizens.

Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio praised China for sending medical equipment and doctors, while Italian politicians and diplomats expressed dismay at the lack of solidarity demonstrated by their closest neighbours.

Maurizio Massari, Italy's EU ambassador, wrote on March 10 that while Italy had asked to activate the EU Mechanism of Civil Protection for the supply of medical equipment, ""not a single EU country responded to the Commission's call"".

""Only China responded bilaterally. Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity,"" he added.

NEW YORK — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday the Chinese government was facilitating a shipment of 1,000 donated ventilators to his state, highlighting the extreme measures leaders are taking in what has become a cutthroat scramble to independently secure enough lifesaving devices during the coronavirus pandemic.

In a sign of the disorganized response to the global crisis, Cuomo went out of his way to praise the collaboration of the Chinese government in securing a shipment of the breathing machines that was scheduled to arrive at Kennedy Airport on Saturday, while acknowledging that the U.S. government’s stockpile of medical supplies would fall drastically short.

“We’re all in the same battle here,” Cuomo said, noting that the state of Oregon volunteered to send 140 ventilators to New York. “And the battle is stopping the spread of the virus.”

Leaders like Cuomo have been forced to go outside normal channels and work with authoritarian governments and private companies, or create partnerships with other states, as the U.S. stockpile of medical supplies is being limited and the Trump administration has threatened to cut off exports, which could erode diplomatic relations.

While the state of Massachusetts used the Patriots’ team plane to pick up over a million masks from China, Russia has also sent medical equipment to the U.S. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said Friday he’d prevent the export of N95 protective masks, prompting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to say that Canada won’t bring retaliatory or punitive measures, while noting that Canada ships gloves and testing kits to the U.S.

“I think of the thousands of nurses who cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system every day,” Trudeau said. “These are things Americans rely on.”

The number of people infected in the U.S. has exceeded a quarter-million, with the death toll climbing past 7,000; more than 3,500 of those deaths are in New York state, including more than 1,900 in New York City alone. In addition to getting ventilators from China and Oregon, Cuomo has issued an order that forces even private hospitals in the state to redistribute ventilators to the hospitals most in need.

“I want this all to be over,” Cuomo said. “It’s only gone on for 30 days since our first case. It feels like an entire lifetime.”

As the number of people infected has grown to more than 1.1 million worldwide, health care systems are straining under the surge of patients. In China, air raid sirens sounded across the country Saturday and flags flew at half staff in tribute to victims of the coronavirus pandemic, including the health care “martyrs” who have died fighting to save others.

With the highest number of infections in Europe and their hospitals overwhelmed, Spain and Italy struggled to protect medical staff on the front lines of the outbreak, while 17 medics in Egypt’s main cancer hospital tested positive for the virus.

Italy and Spain, with combined deaths of more than 25,000 and nearly a quarter-million infections, have reported a high percentage of infections among health care workers.

Carlo Palermo, head of Italy’s hospital doctors’ union, fought tears as he told reporters in Rome of the physical risks and psychological trauma the outbreak is causing, noting reports that two nurses had committed suicide.

“It’s a indescribable condition of stress. Unbearable,” he said.

Overall, new infections continued to slow their once-exponential pace in Italy, with 4,805 new cases registered Saturday that brought the country’s official count to 124,632. The death toll continued to mount, with 681 new victims bringing the world’s highest toll to 15,362.

In France, 7,560 people have died of coronavirus-related issues since the start of the outbreak in the country, including at least 2,028 in nursing homes, health director Jerome Salomon said. More than 440 of the overall deaths happened in the last 24 hours.

World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned African leaders of an “imminent surge” in coronavirus cases on the continent, urging them to open humanitarian corridors to allow the delivery of badly needed medical supplies.

More than half of Africa’s 54 countries have closed air, land and sea borders to prevent the virus’ spread but that has delayed aid shipments. Virus cases in Africa are now over 7,700, and the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned some nations will have more than 10,000 cases by the end of April.

Eleven Russian military planes carrying disinfection experts landed in Serbia on Saturday, which Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin said shows “that we are not alone.”

The transport followed last month’s deployment of a similar Russian coronavirus task force to Italy and the delivery of medical supplies to the United States. Russia has reported a relatively few 4,700 cases and 43 deaths.

In China, where the coronavirus was first detected in December, authorities have cautiously lifted restrictions amid dropping numbers of infections. On Saturday it reported just one new confirmed case in the epicenter of Wuhan and 18 others among people arriving from abroad. There were four new deaths for an official total of 3,326.

Spain’s Health Ministry reported 18,324 infected health workers as of Saturday, representing 15% of the total number of infections in the country.

Still, as Spain completes its third week in a state of emergency, there were signs the number of new infections were slowing, but they were still high with 7,026 new cases reported overnight Saturday and 809 deaths.

In Italy, more than 11,000 medical personnel have been infected — just under 10% of the official total — and some 73 doctors have died, according to the National Institutes of Health and the association of doctors.

Significantly, many were general practitioners or dentists who were believed to have been exposed via respiratory droplets.

A key reason for the high rate among general practitioners was that flu was raging at the same time in the early part of the year, “which didn’t allow us to discriminate between the two,” said Palermo, the doctors’ union head.

Worldwide, confirmed infections rose past 1.1 million and deaths exceeded 60,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say both greatly under-count the true number of victims because of lack of testing, mild cases that were missed and governments that are underplaying the crisis.

At the same time, more than 233,000 people have recovered from the virus, which causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks.

The Transport Minister said 100 beds were ordered from Pukang Medical Equipment, the largest medical equipment manufacturer in Hebei, China.



He said the task of bringing in 100 ICU beds was not easy and three planes had to be deployed to transport the beds – each weighing 250kg – to Malaysia.



“As the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) had barred entry of foreigners into the country, the Transport Ministry had to specially appeal to CAAC to allow Teleport – the logistics and cargo arm of AirAsia – to fly to Tianjin and Beijing to transport the 100 beds in stages.



“In the end, CAAC allowed AirAsia’s Airbus A330 to fly to Tianjin to transport 28 ICU beds, as the beds were big and reached the maximum capacity of the planes,” he said in a Facebook post yesterday.



The Ayer Hitam MP said the government was waiting for the green light from CAAC to allow another AirAsia flight to transport the remaining 72 ICU beds as soon as possible.



He added that many countries such as Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States are also importing beds from China.



He also thanked Yayasan Petronas for their generous donation in contributing 100 electric ICU beds to the Health Ministry to treat Covid-19 patients.



“The ICU beds are a great help to save the lives of the patients who need it.



“Thank you to Yayasan Petronas, Teleport, AirAsia Kargo, the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia and Wisma Putra which facilitated the transport of the ICU beds,” he said.

China,04-06-2020 21:09,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/china-makes-italy-buy-back-its-personal-protective-gear-during-coronavirus-pandemic-report,China makes Italy buy back its personal protective gear during coronavirus pandemic: Report,"China reportedly forced Italy to buy back its own personal protective equipment after the communist country said it would send medical gear to the Mediterranean nation during the coronavirus pandemic.

Italy donated medical equipment to China at the onset of the coronavirus, but when the virus hit the European nation, China put a price tag on the same PPE and forced Italy to buy it back, according to an unnamed senior Trump official who spoke with the Spectator.

""Before the virus hit Europe, Italy sent tons of PPE to China to help China protect its own population. China then has sent Italian PPE back to Italy — some of it, not even all of it ... and charged them for it,"" the Trump administration official said.

China said in March it would donate medical supplies to Italy, which has faced more than 130,000 cases of the coronavirus and over 16,500 deaths.

The official continued, “It’s so disingenuous for Chinese officials now to say we are the ones who are helping the Italians or we are the ones who are helping the developing world when, in fact, they are the ones who infected all of us. Of course they should be helping. They have a special responsibility to help because they are the ones who began the spread of the coronavirus and did not give the information required to the rest of the world to plan accordingly.”

China has sold nearly 4 billion face masks to other countries grappling with the coronavirus, according to Agence France-Presse. The outlet detailed that China has exported 3.86 million masks, 37.5 million pieces of PPE, 16,000 ventilators, and 2.84 million testing kits since March 1. The orders were shipped to more than 50 foreign nations, and customs official Jin Hai told Agence France-Presse the exports were valued at about $1.4 billion.

Some of the medical supplies were even rejected for inadequate standards by the foreign nations, including thousands of test kits sent to Spain that were found to be faulty and 600,000 face masks in the Netherlands that were recalled.

“The disinformation that China has put out is crippling responses around the world. We were a month behind because the Chinese did not share information,” the official told the Spectator. “It’s hard for the world to accept that even the information that they’re putting out now is accurate and acceptable from an epidemiological standpoint. We’re operating on some level with a hand tied behind our back.”",,"['16,000 ventilators']",,
India,04-06-2020 16:37,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southasia/testing-times-for-india-in-race-to-head-off-coronavirus-epidemic-idUSKBN21O11A,Testing times for India in race to head off coronavirus epidemic,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India, like a lot of countries plunged into crisis by the pandemic, is struggling to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, but in few places would the odds of containing the disease appear so bleak should domestic transmission start to multiply.

Officials hope to be testing 20,000 people daily by the end of the week, twice the current rate.

Since India’s first case was confirmed on Jan. 30, India has conducted only a little over 96,000 tests, having focused efforts on identifying those who had come in contact with people who have tested positive.

The results show 4,067 people are infected, and 107 have died of the respiratory disease.

Officials believe a three-week nationwide lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have slowed the spread of the virus in communities, giving them a chance to catch up in the race to stop a full blown epidemic.

Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Indian health ministry leading the effort to tackle the spread of infections, said the country was increasing its testing capacity gradually.

“We should be not be panicking, we should be preparing,” Agarwal said.

“We have followed a pro-active policy from the beginning. Our focus has been on surveillance and contact tracing. Instead of the virus chasing us, we have been chasing the virus.”

Testing had already doubled in the last two days from 5,000 samples a day, another health official said. “This is expected to reach 20,000 in the next three days and increase further over the next few weeks as per the plan,” the official said.

Further out, the country was planning to scale up to 100,000 tests a day in the “worst-case scenario”, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the government arm regulating the testing, said in a statement.

Worldwide, more than 1.25 million people have been reported infected by COVID-19, and far wealthier countries than India have been fiercely criticised for their slow initial response, particularly regarding testing.

Having been chided for a lag in testing, the United States has overtaken China as the country suffering the most infections. The United States has now conducted around a million tests, and 336,000 people have tested positive.

In India, with 1.3 billion people, hundreds of millions of poor, living in unhygienic and crammed-in conditions, there is a very real fear that if the testing starts too far behind the curve, the confirmed cases won’t even account for the tip of the tip of the iceberg.

“There is unanimity among epidemiologists, doctors and district-level administrators that the need of the hour is aggressive and extensive testing,” said former finance minister P. Chidambaram and a leader of the opposition Congress party.

Yet, doctors say the campaign for mass screening is handicapped by a lack of both testing kits and protective gear for staff carrying out the tests.

SOUTH ASIA

Elsewhere in South Asia, the medical infrastructure can be even more inadequate, and authorities are playing catch up as testing kits become available to them.

Bangladesh and Nepal moved on Monday to further restrict people’s movements in the hope of containing the virus.

Nepal’s Finance Minister Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada said a two-week lockdown that was due to end on Tuesday will be extended by another week. Bangladesh, struggling to get its people to abide by a similar shutdown, suspended prayers at mosques to stop worshippers from stepping out of their homes.

Afghanistan has had 367 cases from the 2,737 people it has tested. The western border province of Herat has suffered the worst outbreak, as thousands of Afghans returned in recent weeks from Iran, where the virus has hit hard.

Officials say there has been basic screening such as temperature checks but only a fraction of those crossing the border from Iran have been tested.

In Bangladesh, with a population of 160 million, the government has faced criticism also over a lack of testing.

“We are testing at 14-15 different places. We will increase the number of tests to 1,000-1,500 per day in future,” Health Minister Zahid Malik said. The testing rate has varied from 300 on Sunday, to barely 50 to 100 last week.

Pakistan’s health ministry said it had conducted 35,875 tests so far, based on a policy of testing only those people with a suspect travel history, direct exposure to someone who has tested positive or showing acute symptoms with an underlying history of health problems.

Officials hope to be testing 20,000 people daily by the end of the week, four times the current rate.

Since India's first case was confirmed on Jan 30, they have only conducted 90,000 tests, having focused efforts on identifying people who had come in contact with anyone who has tested positive.

The results show 4,067 people are infected, and 107 have died of the respiratory disease.

Officials believe the three-week nationwide lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi will have slowed the spread of the virus in communities, giving them a chance to catch up in the race to stop a full blown epidemic.

""We are increasing our testing capacity progressively,"" said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the Indian health ministry leading the effort to tackle the spread of infections.

""We should be not be panicking, we should be preparing,"" Agarwal said.

""We have followed a pro-active policy from the beginning. Our focus has been on surveillance and contact tracing. Instead of the virus chasing us, we have been chasing the virus.""

Testing had already doubled in the last two days from 5,000 samples a day, another health official said. ""This is expected to reach 20,000 in the next three days and increase further over the next few weeks as per the plan,"" the official said.

Worldwide, more than 1.25 million people have been reported infected by COVID-19, and far wealthier countries than India have been fiercely criticised for their slow initial response, particularly regarding testing.

Having been chided for a lag in testing, the United States has overtaken China as the country suffering the most infections. The United States has now conducted around a million tests, and 336,000 people have tested positive.

But in a country like India, with 1.3 billion people, hundreds of millions of poor, living in unhygienic and crammed conditions, there is a very real fear that if the testing starts too far behind the curve, the confirmed cases won't even account for the tip of the tip of the iceberg.

""There is unanimity among epidemiologists, doctors and district-level administrators that the need of the hour is aggressive and extensive testing,"" said former finance minister P Chidambaram and a leader of the opposition Congress party.

Yet, doctors say the campaign for mass screening is handicapped by a lack of both testing kits and protective gear for staff carrying out the tests.

Elsewhere in South Asia, the medical infrastructure can be even more inadequate, and authorities are playing catch up as testing kits become available to them.

India,04-06-2020 00:00,https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/06/odd-number-in-india-coronavirus-testing-data-sparks-questions.html,Odd number in India coronavirus testing data sparks questions,"A statistical oddity in India's new coronavirus testing numbers has sparked questions about the country's data management.

Every day for over a week in late March, government data on the difference between the number of overall samples tested and number of individuals tested remained exactly the same - 890.

That is despite both sets of numbers increasing every day.

While the number of overall tests will be greater than or equal to the number of individuals tested, given some people get re-tested, the repetition of the number baffled experts.

""When it is exactly 890 [repeatedly], that needs further explanation,"" said India-based epidemiologist Tanmay Mahapatra.

The recurrence of the 890-gap in the Indian Council of Medical Research's data was reported by data journalism outlet IndiaSpend.

The issue has reignited researchers' calls for the Indian government to share more granular data. Giridhar Babu, a professor of epidemiology with the Public Health Foundation of India, said that would allow researchers to spot potential issues with numbers more quickly.

A researcher advising the Indian government on modelling the virus's spread said his team had been ""tearing [their] hair out"" trying to get authorities to ramp up testing.

""Now, it seems we can't even trust the little data we have,"" said the researcher, asking to remain anonymous to avoid repercussions from authorities.

The gap stems from counting Indians evacuated from abroad who were tested twice, Rajni Kant, a doctor with the Indian Council of Medical Research, told Reuters on Monday. The government said in March that 890 people had been evacuated from overseas.

That suggests authorities appeared to have been subtracting 890 from the overall number of samples tested to provide an approximation of the number of tested individuals.

Overall, India has conducted a little more than 96,000 tests, a tiny proportion of its 1.3-billion population.

Reporting forms did not initially have any way to signal if an individual had already been tested, according to employees at two testing centres interviewed by Reuters.

New government forms issued in recent days, however, include the question, ""Is this a repeated sample?""

India has reported less than 4,300 infected cases and 1,30,000 tests so far. This means India has carried out 93 tests per million population and reported only three cases per million population.

Other countries have carried out way more tests than India; they have also reported a lot higher number of cases and deaths. The US has 3.36 lakh cases with nearly 10,000 deaths. But it has carried out 17 lakh tests at a rate of 5,355 per million population.

In the case of Spain, the number of cases are 1.31 lakh, but it has tested nearly 3.5 lakh people, at a rate of nearly 7,600 per million population. Same is the case with Italy, where over 1.28 lakh are infected and nearly 16,000 have died. Italy has done nearly 7 lakh tests at a rate of 11,436 per million population.

In the case of Germany, the test rate is 10,962 per million with nearly 10 lakh already tested. France has tested 2.24 lakh people at a rate of 3,436 per million population. In UK, 1.95 lakh people have been tested at a rate of 2,880 per million people so far.

India reported a record increase of 386 cases in the past 24 hours, pushing the total number to 1,637, according to the country’s health ministry. The death toll is now 38.

In another worrying development, the first coronavirus case was also confirmed in Mumbai’s Dharavi slum, which is India’s largest and is home to almost one million people living in close, unsanitary quarters. The 56-year-old man was taken to Sion hospital and eight of his family members placed into quarantine.

Quick guide What are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor? Show Hide What is Covid-19? It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case – about as serious as a regular cold – and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back

a new continuous cough - this means you’ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. How many people have been affected? China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.

Yet for a densely populated country of 1.3 billion people, the number of cases is still relatively low compared with Europe and the US, and believed to be linked to both low levels of testing and poor access to an already overstretched healthcare system with people not reporting their symptoms.

India spends only about 1.3% of its GDP on public health, among the lowest in the world. Only 47,951 tests have been done so far and there are just 51 government-approved testing centres across the country.

The jump in number of cases was linked to an annual two-day convention of the Muslim sect Tablighi Jamaat on 13 March, for which about 3,500 people gathered from all over the country and abroad in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin. Almost 2,000 stayed in the area for days afterwards, and the area has become the coronavirus hotspot of India.

The outbreak from the Nizamuddin mosque gathering also inflamed religious tensions in a city still reeling from communal riots last month that took 50 lives, with Hindu mobs rampaging through the streets attacking Muslims in their homes.

Across Indian media and social networks, Muslims were blamed for spreading the virus while “Corona Jihad” began to trend on Twitter.

The gathering also appeared to trigger a spread of the virus across numerous states from Kashmir to West Bengal by those who returned home afterwards. So far, 10 people who attended the event have died while 1,800 people have been sent to nine hospitals and quarantine centres across the country.

However, despite the jump in number of cases this week, the Indian government insists there is still no community transmission and that cases have been either from those who travelled abroad or in localised incidents. Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary in the health ministry, told reporters: “Nowhere have we said that there is a community transmission. We are still in a local transmission in this country.”



Raman R Gangakhedkar, the head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), also insisted there was “no reason to panic at the moment”. Nonetheless, the ICMR conceded last month that community transmission was “inevitable” in India.

“Until we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission, let us not over interpret things,” said Gangakhedkar.

Doctors in hospitals across India said the lack of proper protective equipment available for medical staff, including basic masks, meant that patients presenting with coronavirus symptoms were being turned away. Doctors in Kolkata described how they were made to wear plastic raincoats to examine possible coronavirus patients, while a doctor in a Delhi hospital resorted to wearing a motorcycle helmet to cover his face.

One junior doctor working in a Kolkata hospital where coronavirus patients are being treated, described how “for over a week, we came in close contact with suspected corona patients without proper protective gear … We all are left at the mercy of God.”

The doctor also cast aspersions on the claim that the disease was not already spreading within impoverished communities.

“Every day thousands of people gather here, seeking treatment for many infectious diseases. Last week, I noticed, hundreds of people, with many coughing, having fever and breathing problems stood on queue waiting for their turn to be examined by us,” he said.

“They stood in the queue for hours and many of them were coughing and sneezing. I have every reason to believe many were carriers of Covid-19 who spread the infection to people in that same line, who in turn are now spreading it in the community … hundred or thousand times more people should be tested for the infection. Otherwise, the coronavirus situation will turn unmanageable.”

A recent report, jointly published by three American universities and the Delhi School of Economics, claimed that India could have as many as 1.3 million coronavirus infections by mid-May.

Testing capacity may about to increase. Last week, Mylab Discovery, a company based in the city of Pune, became the first Indian firm to get full approval to make and sell testing kits, which have already shipped to labs in Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, Goa and Bangalore. Each Mylab kit can test 100 samples and costs 1,200 rupees.

Private company Practo also announced it has been authorised by the government to conduct private coronavirus tests, which can be booked directly. The facility is available only for Mumbai residents but they say it will soon be widened out to the whole country.","['47,951 tests']",,,
India,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52106565,Coronavirus: India's race to build a low-cost ventilator to save Covid-19 patients,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption India has an estimated 48,000 ventilators and most of them are already in use

In an 8,000 sq ft (743 sq m) facility in the western Indian city of Pune, a bunch of young engineers are racing against time to develop a low-cost ventilator that could save thousands of lives if the coronavirus pandemic overwhelms the country's hospitals.

These engineers - from some of India's top engineering schools - belong to a barely two-year-old start-up which makes water-less robots that clean solar plants.

Last year, Nocca Robotics had a modest turnover of 2.7 million rupees ($36,000; £29,000). The average age of the mechanical, electronic and aerospace engineers who work for the firm is 26.

India, by most estimates, only has 48,000 ventilators. Nobody quite knows how many of these breathing assistance machines are working. But it is a fair assumption that all those available are being used in intensive care units on existing patients with other diseases.

About one in six people with Covid-19 gets seriously ill, which can include breathing difficulties. The country faces seeing its hospitals hobbled as others around the world have been, with doctors forced to choose who they try to save.

At least two Indian companies make ventilators at present, mostly from imported components. They cost around 150,000 ($1,987; £1,612) rupees each. One of them, AgVa Healthcare, plans to make 20,000 in a month's time. India has also ordered 10,000 from China, but that will meet just a fraction of the potential demand.

The invasive ventilator being developed by the engineers at Nocca Robotics will cost 50,000 rupees ($662). Within five days of beginning work, a group of seven engineers at the start-up have three prototypes of a portable machine ready.

They are being tested on artificial lungs, a prosthetic device that provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide from the blood. By 7 April, they plan to be ready with machines that can be tested on patients after approvals.

""It is most certainly doable,"" said Dr Deepak Padmanabhan, a cardiologist at Bangalore's Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, and a key advisor on this project. ""The simulations on artificial lungs have been done and seem to work well.""

Inspiring story

The race to develop this inexpensive, home-grown invasive breathing machine is an inspiring story of swift coordination and speedy action involving public and private institutions, something not common in India.

""The pandemic has brought us all together in ways I could never imagine,"" says Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, a professor of biological sciences and bioengineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, and a key mover of the project.

The young engineers mined open source medical supplies groups on the internet to find information on how to make the ventilators. After securing permissions, it took them exactly eight hours to produce the first prototype. Of particular use, say doctors, were some designs by engineers at MIT. With imports stalled, the engineers picked up pressure sensors - a key component of the machine that helps supply oxygen to lungs at a pressure that doesn't cause injury - from those used in drones and available in the market.

Image copyright AFP Image caption India needs thousands of ventilators to cope with a possible rush of patients

Local authorities helped open firms that stock components - each machine needs 150 to 200 parts - and made sure that a bunch of engineers who had returned home to Nanded after the lockdown were still able to travel 400km (248 miles) back to Pune to work on the machine.

Some leading Indian industrialists, including a major medical device-making company, have offered their factories to manufacture the machines. The plan is to make 30,000 ventilators, at around 150-200 a day, by the middle of May.

Social media influencers joined the effort. Rahul Raj, a lithium battery-maker and an IIT alumnus, crowd-sourced a group called Caring Indians to ""pool resources and experience"" to cope with the pandemic. Within 24 hours, 1,000 people had signed up. ""We tweeted to the local lawmaker and local police in Pune to help the developers, and made contacts with people who would be interested in the project,"" Mr Raj said.

'No-frills machine'

Expat Indian doctors and entrepreneurs who went to the same school - IIT is India's leading engineering school and alumni include Google chief Sundar Pichai - held Zoom meetings with the young developers, advising them and asking questions about the machine's development. The head of a US-based company gave them a 90-minute lecture on how to manage production. A former chief of an info-tech company told them how to source the components.

Lastly, a bunch of doctors vetted every development and asked hard questions. In the end, more than a dozen top professionals - pulmonologists, cardiologists, scientists, innovators, venture capitalists - have guided the young team.

Doctors say the goal is to develop a ""no-frills"" breathing machine tailored to Indian conditions.

Ventilators depend on pressurised oxygen supply from hospital plants. But in a country where piped oxygen is not available in many small towns and villages, developers are seeing whether they can also make the machine run on oxygen cylinders. ""In a way we are trying to de-modernise the machine to what it was barely 20 years ago,"" says Dr Padmanabhan.

""We are not experienced. But we are very good at making products easily. The robots that we make are much more complex to make. But this is a life-saving machine and carries risk, so we have to be very, very careful that we develop a perfect product which clears all approvals,"" said Nikhil Kurele, the 26-year-old co-founder and chief executive officer of Nocca Robotics.

With the toll rising in India, where a nationwide lockdown is in force, production of AgVa's portable ventilator has shot up from 500 a month to 20,000.

""There was no way we could have foreseen something as big as this,"" said neurosurgeon Deepak Agrawal, who co-developed the device with robot scientist Diwakar Vaish.

Priced at approximately $2,000, the AgVa ventilator is a fraction of the price of conventional ventilators, which go for more than $10,000.

India, like most countries, has a critical shortage of beds and ventilators for its 1.3 billion people. The South Asian nation has so far reported more than 1,600 cases and 38 deaths from COVID-19.

To boost preparedness for a surge in cases, the Indian government has banned the export of coronavirus-linked medical exports, including ventilators.

The AgVa plant near the capital New Delhi has been given permission to work flat-out to make what could be a key weapon when India has to fully confront the pandemic.

The makers say the AgVa - which weighs just 3.5 kilos (7.7 pounds) - will help move less critical patients back to their homes as their machine is easy to transport and install, and does not need much power.

""In case you want to convert a hotel into an ICU, you can simply put this device and start working as it doesn't require other infrastructure,"" said Vaish.

Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest passenger car maker, has pledged to help AgVa ramp up production after the government called on all auto firms to contribute to the anti-coronavirus effort.

Seeing people queue for life-support equipment at the All India Institute for Medical Science in Delhi in 2016 convinced Vaish and Agrawal that there was an acute need for a cheap and portable ventilator.

""ICU care is very expensive. In the private sector, even the richest of rich can't afford it for a long time,"" said Vaish.

They avoided expensive imported parts to keep the cost low, Agrawal added.

With its cash-starved health system, India only has about 40,000 ventilators, and experts who have seen the coronavirus crisis explode in Europe have warned this could become a catastrophic shortage for India.

RV Asokan, secretary-general of the Indian Medical Association, said the AgVa portable ventilator was the kind of innovation needed to fill health gaps.

""It is a basic model which will serve in the current scenario as it is a straightforward oxygenation device,"" said Asokan, who added that while the device would not support patients who had had transplants or other major surgeries, it would be very useful for COVID-19 patients and others with less severe needs.

Sunita Sharma, whose son was hospitalised for five years with a crippling nerve condition, was given one of the machines for free.

""My husband and I had to take turns to stay with him at the hospital, and that affected our lives,"" Sharma told AFP.

The hospital chain - without specifying the number - said it had dedicated a portion of those ventilators for treating COVID-19 patients.

Hospitals are now earmarking isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients so that other patients and staff are protected from the novel coronavirus infection.

A ventilator is a mechanical breathing device that can blow air and oxygen into the lungs. Ventilators are critical for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe COVID-19.

While on paper 1,000 ventilators sounds a big number, what will be available for COVID-19 patients in reality is much lower as hospitals have to reserve ventilators to treat non-COVID-19 cases such as heart attacks, strokes and other emergency cases.

There is a huge cost element, too, in using ventilators. A ventilator costs anywhere between Rs 5-15 lakh.

""Generally, we keep three ventilators for 10 beds ICU. These machines are expensive, so hospitals typically bill them as part of ICU charges, some bill them separately as well,"" said Dr. Rajendra Patankar, Chief Executive Officer of Pune-based Jupiter Hospital.

The average ICU charges per day in Mumbai is Rs 4,000. In some high-end tertiary hospitals, the charges will go upwards of Rs 20,000 per day. These are conservative estimates taken from publicly available information. More than two-thirds of the ICU billing constitutes ventilator charges.

As per a Brookings report, the country might need anywhere between 110,000 - 220,000 ventilators by May 15 in the worst-case scenario. The number of ventilators today available in the country is a maximum of 57,000. Most of those available ventilators cannot be put to use.

But, experts say we may struggle if COVID-19 cases surge in days ahead as nearly 3 percent of COVID-19 patients would require ventilators. Experts across the spectrum ranging from doctors to engineers and entrepreneurs are trying to solve the ventilator puzzle.

India has reported a total of 1,251 positive coronavirus cases as of March 31 morning.

Addressing ventilator shortage

The government has declared essential technical features for COVID-19 ventilators.

As per the government specification, a ventilator should be turbine, compressor based because the installation sites might not have central oxygen lines. Among other features, the machine should have invasive, non-invasive and CPAP features to make them versatile. They also need to have 200-600 ML tidal volume, Lung Mechanics Display and continuous working capability for 4-5 days.

But, to get ventilators of those specifications will take time. Moneycontrol earlier reported that companies were running low on inventories. Getting components from China has become difficult due to the disruption of the supply chain. Sources have told Moneycontrol that China, too, has started clamping down on exports of ventilators and related components to shore up its own requirement.

“To tackle the shortage of ventilators India should go in for two-three models, one an low-cost respirator model for epidemic and a high-end technology ICU model,"" said Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator - Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMed), the domestic medical devices trade lobby.

AiMeD said it contacted seven of its ten major manufacturers, which had confirmed that the current production capacity of ventilators was 5,500-5,750 pieces per month. This is where defense labs, big automotive and capital goods companies are coming to rescue.

Maruti Suzuki India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bharat Forge, Tata Motors, Hyundai and public sector BHEL, BEL and DRDO are coming up offering their expertise to rapidly scale up production of ventilators.

For instance - SkanRay, Mysuru-based ventilator manufacturer has created a consortium with BEL, BHEL and Mahindra to ramp up production from standard 2,000 units per month to 30,000 units per month by May.

Similarly, Delhi-NCR-based Agva has tied up with Maruti to scale up production from 400 units per month to 10,000 pcs per month by May. Others are similarly gearing up to address the challenge.

""The aim is to produce 50,000 ventilators per month by May,"" Nath said.

SkanRay, the leading ventilator manufacturer, has created a consortium with BEL, BHEL and Mahindra to ramp up production from standard 2,000 pieces per month to currently 5,000 pieces per month and 30,000 pieces per month by May. Similarly, Agva has tied up with Maruti to scale up production from 400 pieces per month to 4,000 pieces per month in April to 10,000 pieces per month by May. Others are similarly gearing up to address the challenge.

No frill 'Ambu Bag'

While the conventional ventilators are expensive, hard to produce and not portable, experts say we may have to find other ways to tide over the ventilator shortage if we begin to see a surge of cases.

One of the solutions put forward was the bag-valve mask, often called by the proprietary name of ‘Ambu Bag,’ used for resuscitation in emergency situations.

""The ‘bag valve mask’ is currently hand-powered and, therefore, not suitable for continuous use as a ventilator. It would be easy to design a similar device powered by an electrical source, which could be a car battery, apart from the conventional power supply. It could be made portable, and therefore adopted in villages and other areas without a power supply and be inexpensive enough to manufacture in bulk,"" said Prof BS Murty, Director - IIT Hyderabad and Prof. V. Eswaran of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, IIT Hyderabad.

Mahindra & Mahindra is working on an automated version of the Bag Valve Mask ventilator (commonly known as Ambu bag). Once proven, Mahindra says this design will be made available to all for manufacturing. Bag Valve Mask can be used and thrown away, removing the possibility of cross-contamination.

Anand Mahindra, Chairman of Mahindra Group announced it will cost below Rs 7,500.

CPAP - an interim solution

Another interim solution that companies have started working on is converting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or CPAP machines as breath support devices for COVID-19 patients.

CPAP machines help people with sleep apnea breathe more easily. It is also widely used in premature babies whose lungs are not fully developed and require respiratory support. A CPAP machine increases the air pressure in a person's throat to prevent airway from collapsing when inhaled.

Bengaluru-based InnAccel is working to develop a CPAP that can be used for COVID-19 patients needing breathing support.

InnAccel develops and markets a portable CPAP machine called 'Saans' – that runs on a battery where there is no power source. It can also be hand-pumped if the battery fails.

""A bag valve mask is the simplest level of ventilation. We should use it but I don't think that is anyway adequate for COVID-19 patients. But, there are intermediate modes between absolutely high-end ventilators and a rudimentary bag in mask. CPAP is one mode,"" said Siraj Dhanani, co-founder and CEO of InnAccel.

Dhanani said they were working on a prototype based on their CPAP platform to develop devices for COVID-19 patients.

The government specified ventilators should have basic modes such as pressure control, volume control and pressure support ventilation, along with CPAP.

Splitting ventilators

Doctors and engineers are also scrambling to figure out how to modify their ventilators to serve a large number of patients with limited resources.

A team at Delhi-NCR based hospital chain Max Healthcare was able to split their ventilator, which can be used for upto four patients if necessary.

The critical care experts at Max Healthcare extensively tested the device and determined that it worked very well on all functional and patient safety parameters. The device is to be used only in case of dire shortage of ventilators and when we have a large number of patients needing ventilator support. It is not simple as it sounds though.

""My team and I then designed a simple but ingenious device, which can be safely attached to the ventilators, splitting the airflow into four distinct streams for 4 patients. We even produced this device in-house using the 3D printing facilities at Max Healthcare,” said Yudhvir Singh, Head - BioMedical Engineering, Max Healthcare.

Currently, Max Healthcare has 254 adult ventilators across its network. It is not Max alone; other hospitals have also started work on splitting ventilators.

India,,http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/toaster-size-ventilator-from-india-helps-hospitals-in-virus-fight_191441?profile=1373,Toaster-size ventilator from India helps hospitals in virus fight,"NEW DELHI, India (AFP) — Originally created by a robot scientist and a neurosurgeon to help India's poor, a toaster-size ventilator is offering hope in the country's fight against the coronavirus pandemic, and demand is booming.

The virus at its most lethal attacks the lungs, making ventilators — which pump breathable air into a patient — critical for hospitals around the world as they are swamped with COVID-19 cases.

With the toll rising in India, where a nationwide lockdown is in force, production of AgVa's portable ventilator has shot up from 500 a month to 20,000.

“There was no way we could have foreseen something as big as this,” said neurosurgeon Deepak Agrawal, who co-developed the device with robot scientist Diwakar Vaish.

Priced at around US$2,000, the AgVa ventilator is a fraction of the price of conventional ventilators, which go for more than US$10,000.

India, like most countries, has a critical shortage of beds and ventilators for its 1.3 billion people. The South Asian nation has so far reported more than 2,300 cases and 56 deaths from COVID-19.

To boost preparedness for a surge in cases, the Indian Government has banned the export of coronavirus-linked medical exports, including ventilators.

The AgVa plant near the capital New Delhi has been given permission to work flat out to make what could be a key weapon when India has to fully confront the pandemic.

The makers say the AgVa — which weighs just 3.5 kilos (7.7 pounds) — will help move less critical patients back to their homes, as their machine is easy to transport and install and only requires low power.

“In case you want to convert a hotel into an ICU, you can simply put [in] this device and start working, as it doesn't require other infrastructure,” said Vaish.

Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest passenger car maker, has pledged to help AgVa ramp up production after the Government called on all auto firms to contribute to the anti-coronavirus effort.

Seeing people queue for life support equipment at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi in 2016 convinced Vaish and Agrawal that there was an acute need for a cheap and portable ventilator.

“ICU care is very expensive. In the private sector, even the richest of rich can't afford it for a long time,” said Vaish.

They avoided expensive imported parts to keep the cost low, Agrawal added.

With its cash-starved health system, India has only around 40,000 ventilators, and experts who have seen the coronavirus crisis explode in Europe have warned this could become a catastrophic shortage for India.

R V Asokan, secretary general of the Indian Medical Association, said the AgVa portable ventilator was the kind of innovation needed to fill health gaps.

“It is a basic model which will serve in the current scenario, as it is a straightforward oxygenation device,” said Asokan, who added that it would help COVID-19 patients but not those who have had transplants and other major surgeries.

Sunita Sharma, whose son was hospitalised for five years with a crippling nerve condition, was given one of the machines for free.

“My husband and I had to take turns to stay with him at the hospital, and that affected our lives,” Sharma told AFP.

“I was devastated when the doctors told me my son would have to spend the rest of his life on a ventilator bed.

”At least now I can stay home to take care of him and the rest of the household.”",,"['40,000 ventilators']",,
India,03-24-2020 00:00,https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2020/03/24/is-indias-health-infrastructure-equipped-to-handle-an-epidemic/,COVID-19 | Is India’s health infrastructure equipped to handle an epidemic?,"With growing number of coronavirus cases in India (and worldwide), policymakers have sprung into action – more information is being disseminated about preventive measures such as hand washing and not touching the face. Social distancing has been suggested as a tool to “flatten the curve”, or in other words, prevent the health system from being overburdened. Although the number of COVID-19 cases are still low in India, experts have warned against community spread of the disease which will lead to rapid and huge increase in demand for health facilities. Private healthcare is expensive and unavailable for many poor households in India which leaves public healthcare facilities as the only available option for them. For patients who are found to be COVID-19 positive, isolation wards are needed; additionally, for critical cases, intensive care is needed. Currently, almost all suspected cases of coronavirus are referred to government hospitals and it’s important to assess where we stand in terms of medical capacity to provide necessary healthcare to the affected individuals.

In this piece we focus on availability of government hospital beds[1] for major states in India. Using data from National Health Profile–2019, we observed that there are 7,13,986 total government hospital beds available in India. This amounts to 0.55 beds per 1000 population[2,3]. The elderly population (aged 60 and above) is especially vulnerable, given more complications which are reported for patients in this age group. The availability of beds for elderly population in India is 5.18 beds per 1000 population. In the heatmaps below, we show the state-level variation in availability of government beds in India.

We observe that many states lie below the national level figure (0.55 beds per 1000 population)[4], these include Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Odisha, Assam and Manipur. These 12 states together account for close to 70% of the total population in India. Bihar has an acute shortage of government hospital beds with just 0.11 beds available per 1000 population. Some states do better on this metric such as West Bengal (2.25 government beds per 1000) and Sikkim (2.34 government beds per 1000). The capital city of Delhi has 1.05 beds per 1000 population and the southern states of Kerala (1.05 beds per 1000) and Tamil Nadu (1.1 beds per 1000) also have better availability of beds. The scenario is pretty similar when the analysis is done for just the elderly population: Northeastern states do far better than others; southern states also have higher number of beds available for elderly population — for example, Kerala (7.4), Tamil Nadu (7.8), Karnataka (8.6) — while northern and central states have relatively low availability of government beds for elderly population.

The availability of government beds is abysmally low in India, and an epidemic like coronavirus can very quickly complicate the problem even further. An estimated 5-10% of total patients will require critical care in form of ventilator support. In a worst-case scenario, according to one estimate at least, we may end up with 2.2 million cases in India[5] by May 15, which implies that we will need 110,000 to 220,000 ventilators. We have no official figures on the number of ventilators available in the public sector, however ,we arrive at an estimated figure using the number of hospital beds available — 7,13,986 total government beds, out of which 5-8% are ICU beds (35,699 to 57,119 ICU beds)[6]. Assuming that 50% of these ICU beds have ventilators, we arrive at an estimate of 17,850 to 25,556 ventilators in the country. Even in the best-case scenario where all ICU beds are equipped with ventilators, we have a maximum of ~57k ventilators to cater to a growing number of COVID-19 patients. Clearly, the growing demand for ventilators is going to outstrip the limited supply really soon.

While demand is being kept down by behavioural interventions such as social distancing etc, supply of beds and critical care equipment like ventilators needs to be quickly ramped up. In this regard, the government has already banned the export of critical care medical equipment. Additionally, excess capacity in private healthcare can be strategically used by the government and emergency plans of setting up hospital beds in army camps should be executed as soon as possible.

All type of passenger movements through all immigration land check posts located at India's borders with four SAARC members Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal and Pakistan will be closed by midnight today. India's borders will Myanmar will also remain closed.

What has helped India so far is the slow pace of the progress of the infection, as compared to several Asian and European countries and America. While the outbreak has attained pandemic proportions in most of these countries, it is still limited to people with a travel history and their local contacts in India. Widespread of infection at the community level is yet to be seen, allowing the government - Centre and States - to develop strategies to contain the spread of infection rather than large scale mitigation, which could be an extremely tough challenge.

According to the health authorities, India is still in the first and early second stage of the outbreak. This means that the outbreak has been only travel-related, with some signs of the start of local transmission. The containment strategies hence have been points of entry surveillance, the listing of contacts (made by the infected ones with travel history), adoption of quarantine measures - both home quarantine as well as the government's isolation centres - and social distancing measures like the closure of schools, ban on gatherings, to limit the spread of disease at a large community level.

The next stage, which requires a much bigger preparation, is to be ready with mass mitigation strategies meant to minimise mortality and morbidity while ensuring essential services and continuity of operations with minimal impact on health and non-health sectors.

Manoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow of Delhi based think tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF) points out in an article that India's 1.2 million government hospital beds are heavily skewed towards urban areas with hugely disparate distribution across states.

""An intensified spread of Covid-19 could put up a demand for millions of more beds. According to a WHO-China joint mission report, 5% of people diagnosed with Covid-19 require artificial respiration, another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen and not just for a few days since the duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). So, high-quality care is needed by the 20 per cent or so who are infected, which really means ICU-level care"", Joshi notes.

Here lies the real test, as Joshi says India's 70,000 ICU beds available, in big and small hospitals and nursing homes, cater to some 5 million patients requiring ICU admissions every year and is already stressed.

Gross inadequacy in terms of ventilators in hospitals, levels of hygiene can only make the situation worse.

In a presentation before the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has already flagged the enormity of the task ahead. In the case of a large outbreak, the MoHFW talks about the triage of patients through screening clinics and surge capacity of hospitals for isolation and ventilator management.

The government has also initiated steps to check shortages and black-marketing of protection gears, especially masks and sanitizer and asked manufacturers to enhance their production capacity of these items, to make the supply chain smooth.

The coming days will be crucial, and India needs, along with all that is being planned and done, more luck on its side to handle any outbreak of larger proportion.

Updated: Apr 07, 2020 07:10 IST

China donated 170,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits to India on Monday to help the neighbouring country fight the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, the health ministry said.

Domestic supply of an additional 20,000 PPE will begin soon. Altogether, these 190,000 kits will be distributed to hospitals and health facilities. This will add to the 387,000 PPE already available in the country.

The development comes amid a debate over whether India has enough PPE kits to arm its frontline health care workers who are working round the clock to contain the spread of the fast-spreading infection.

In addition, 200,000 domestically produced N95 masks are being sent to various hospitals, the health ministry statement said, adding that about 1.6 million such masks are already available.

A large part of the fresh supplies will be sent to states with comparatively higher number of cases such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan.

“The commencement of foreign supplies marks a major milestone in our efforts to procure personal protection equipment for the battle against Covid-19,” the ministry said.

It added that an order for 8 million complete PPE kits was placed before a Singapore company. Also, negotiations are in final stages with a Chinese platform for placing an order of 6 million complete PPE kits, which will also include N95 masks.",,,,"['387,000 PPE', '20,000 PPE']"

New Delhi: India on Monday received 1.70 lakh personal protection equipment (PPE) coveralls donated by China, the Union Health Ministry said.

Along with the domestic supplies of 20,000 coveralls, a total of 1.90 lakh coveralls will now be distributed to hospitals and will add to the 3,87,473 PPEs already available in the country as of now, it said.

Supply lines from abroad opened up today with the receipt of 1.70 lakh Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) coveralls from China which have been donated to the Government of India, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in press release.

A total of 2.94 lakh PPE coveralls have been arranged and supplied by the Centre till now to states, the ministry said.

In addition to this, 2 lakh domestically produced N-95 masks are also being sent to various hospitals. Including these, over 20 lakh N-95 masks have been supplied by the government of India.

“About 16 lakh N-95 masks are presently available in the country, and this figure will increase with the fresh supply of 2 lakh masks,” the ministry said.

Major portions of the fresh supplies are being sent to states with comparatively higher number of cases such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Delhi, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Rajasthan.

Supplies are also being sent to central institutions like AIIMS, Safdarjung and RML hospitals, RIMS, NEIGRIHMS, BHU and AMU, it said.

“The commencement of foreign supplies marks a major milestone in our efforts to procure personal protection equipment for the battle against COVID-19,” the ministry said.

An order for 80 lakh complete PPE kits (including N-95 masks) had been placed on a Singapore-based platform earlier and now it has been indicated that supplies will commence from April 11 with the first installment of 2 lakh, followed by 8 lakh more soon thereafter, it said.

“Negotiations are in final stages with a Chinese platform for placing an order of 60 lakh complete PPE kits, which will also include N95 masks. Separate orders for N95 masks and protective goggles are also being placed on some foreign companies,” the ministry said in its statement.

Giving a further fillip to domestic capabilities, the Northern Railways has developed a PPE coverall, in addition to the PPE coveralls and N-99 masks developed by DRDO earlier, it said.

“Efforts are now being made to start mass production of these products,” the ministry said, adding existing N-95 mask producers have increased their capacity to about 80,000 masks per day.

In all, srders have been placed for 112.76 lakhs standalone N95 masks and 157.32 lakhs PPE coveralls. Out of these, 80 lakh PPE kits will include N95 masks, it said,

“The objective is to achieve a supply of about 10 lakh PPE kits per week. Looking at the number of patients in the country, sufficient quantities are available for the moment. Further supplies are expected within this week,” the ministry said.

India,,https://qz.com/india/1829905/the-iits-are-stepping-up-to-help-india-battle-coronavirus/,The IITs are stepping up to help India battle coronavirus,"India’s hospitals are deprived of adequate resources to deal with a rapidly increasing number of Covid-19 cases. And trying to bridge this gap are the country’s top technology institutes.

Students and faculty at the many Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) have joined the fight against coronavirus as the number of positive cases in the country surpassed 1,900 and the death toll, 50.

Some are producing personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers who have been forced to the frontlines with raincoats and helmets in the absence of proper protective gear. Up to 90 tonnes of PPE have been shipped to Serbia from India.

Meanwhile, others are developing low-cost ventilators, which is in short supply. The nation has only 30,000-50,000 ventilators which are “wholly inadequate,” according to the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP). Buying 10,000 units from China is not nearly enough. “We will need upwards of 700,000 and up to a million ventilators to address the peak (demand),” the health research organisation said.

Cheaper Covid-19 testing kits, alcohol-based sanitisers, and other solutions, small and big, are also in the works.

With a bunch of prototypes ready, these institutes are seeking the government’s help to tie up with public sector undertakings for large-scale manufacturing.

Seeking protection on auto mode

The safety of health professionals is on top of most researchers’ mind.

IIT-Guwahati’s chemistry and bioscience & bioengineering departments are together developing prototypes of waterproof protective gear that come with an antiviral coating. Additionally, design experts at the institute have created a 3D-printed prototype of a full-face shield, including headgear, whose manufacturing, they say, can be scaled up immediately.

“Our idea is to make this a state-of-the-art facility for the entire northeast region,” IIT-Guwahati director, TG Sitharam, told The Economic Times newspaper. “This centre, in future, would help develop highly competent manpower for diagnosis of different infectious diseases in the early stage of infection and thus their prevention too.”

A startup incubated at IIT-Delhi has, in the meantime, developed the capacity to produce 100,000 N95 masks a day, but it needs permission to keep production running during the lockdown.

One solution to lighten the load on the overburdened medical system is to curb health workers’ exposure to patients altogether. IIT-Guwahati, for instance, is making robotic units that can screen potential patients and deliver medicines and food in isolation wards.

Students at the institute have also created drones that can be used to spray disinfectants and undertake surveillance without involving humans. They already have seven models of the drone with capacities between 10 litres and 25 litres, and they could make 50 by April-end, one of the student innovators told ThePrint.

Besides medical professionals, patients, too, are in need of some rapid innovations.

Bringing order to patient chaos

With merely 6.8 tests done per million population, which is among the world’s lowest, the Narendra Modi government has come under fire for gross under-testing.

A shortage of kits is a big concern. Researchers at IIT-Delhi have now developed a testing kit which they claim is cheaper and is currently undergoing clinical trials at the Pune-based National Institute of Virology. Although its price isn’t public yet, the government has capped prices at Rs4,500 ($59) for now.

Meanwhile, IIT-Guwahati has provided life-saving equipment to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital in Assam, including two real-time polymerase chain reaction machines used to analyse DNA samples for Covid-19 diagnosis. The machines can analyse up to 2,000 samples in 24 hours. The institute is also working on making handheld temperature measuring units, ICU beds, ventilators, medical waste disposal for isolation wards, disinfection showers, hand sanitisers, and preventive masks.

Severe cases of Covid-19 infection cause or exacerbate respiratory problems.

With few ventilators—most of them already being used for critical care patients—the situation can quickly take an alarming turn. That’s why IIT-Hyderabad director BS Murty proposed that the government consider the existing “bag valve masks” as an inexpensive, easier-to-make option. These are self-inflatable devices used to deliver breathing support in emergency situations. These cost a mere Rs5,000 compared to the Rs40 lakh for each conventional ventilator.

Since the devices are handheld, they cannot be a permanent replacement for ventilators. However, “it would be easy to design a similar device powered by an electrical source, which could be a car battery, apart from the conventional power supply,” professors at the university told Mumbai Mirror. “It could be made portable, and, therefore, adopted in villages and other areas without a power supply and be inexpensive enough to manufacture in bulk.”

Stopping the spread

At the Guwahati and Kanpur IIT campuses, researchers are working on vaccines as well.

Three faculty members of IIT-Kanpur’s biosciences department have already “managed to isolate the RNA extract of the virus,” deputy director Manindra Agrawal told The Indian Express on April 1. “They are in the process of sourcing a similar extract from IIT-Indore. We are hopeful of developing a possible vaccine in the next couple of months, which can then be tested in a clinical trial.”

In the meantime, basic hygiene is in focus. As sanitiser supplies run out, these institutions are making their own.

IIT-Roorkee manufactured over 150 litres of a herbal hand sanitiser that is now being distributed free on the campus. “It is imperative to maintain basic hygiene practices since there is no specific treatment or vaccine for the disease,” said Siddharth Sharma, a research scholar at IIT Roorkee’s centre of nanotechnology, who helped prepare the product.

Researchers at the IIT Kharagpur campus have also come up with two different alcohol-based hand sanitisers. The Ropar, Hyderabad, and Madras campuses, too, have begun producing their own.

Moreover, as India buckles up for stage 3, the community transmission period, of the pandemic, monitoring suspected cases and curtailing the spread is going to get trickier.

At IIT-Bombay, students and alumni have developed a mobile app called Corontine. It is based on geo-fencing, alerting the authorities if a carrier moves out of a quarantine zone. The app can generate alerts such as text messages and emails if the user moves out of the designated area. It also notifies authorities if a device is transmitting the same coordinates for too long so a call can be made to check the whereabouts of the person.

In Punjab, students at the IIT-Ropar campus, together with other engineers, came up with an app to warn users about suspected or confirmed Covid-19 carriers within two or three feet of them, as long as the other person has registered on the app, too. Ideally, it would also make it easier to trace who is coming in contact with whom.",,"['50,000 ventilators']",,"['100,000 N95 masks']"

The world's fourth-most populous country of 270 million performed better than only Ethiopia, Nigeria and Bangladesh, according to the site, which has introduced a new feature showing testing rates relative to the respective country's population.

The three worst-preforming are Ethiopia, with 16 tests for every million people, Bangladesh (18), and Nigeria (19). In comparison, South Korea tests 8,996 for every million people, Singapore 6,666, and Malaysia 1,605.

Asked by The Straits Times on Monday (April 6) about Indonesia's very low rate, Mr Achmad Yurianto, a government spokesman for Covid-19 management, said: ""We don't test based on the size of population, but based on contact tracing of positive cases as well as based on the visits to health facilities by people with Covid-19 symptoms.""

He added that Indonesia is also doing rapid tests, but the number of such tests - and the number of any confirmation tests after this procedure - do not add to the Covid-19 national tallies.

He stressed that such rapid tests, which are not as reliable as the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, are used only to help with early ""screening"" of people who may have contracted the virus.

Any close contact who is tested negative using a rapid test kit must redo the procedure after a period of time, while anyone testing positive would have to be confirmed by a PCR test.

Rapid tests are antibody tests, which determines whether a person has developed immunity to the coronavirus. These tests, however, have a limited role in diagnosis, according to experts, as it takes the body four days or longer after infection to produce antibodies, which would be too late for the purpose of quick detection and contact tracing.

Indonesia's ranking among the likes of Ethiopia comes as a surprise as the South-east Asia's largest economy has a GDP that is at least three times larger than any of the three bottom-ranked countries. Indonesia’s GDP per capita, often used as an indicator of a country’s standard of living, is at least double.

Indonesia has a GDP of USD$1.1 trillion (S$ 1.58 trillion), while Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nigeria has a GDP of US$81 billion, US$250 billion, and US$375 billion, respectively.

Indonesia's health ministry has been widely criticised for red tape in bringing in test kits, as well as equipment to read the PCR test samples.

Recent media reports have also pointed out that the ministry's official Covid-19 death toll nationwide, currently at 209, is an understated figure contradicted by separate announcements by local governments in West Java and the Jakarta municipal government, which indicate a higher toll. This has raised questions about the health ministry's transparency and credibility in disclosing data, the local media has reported.

Jakarta, where about half of the national confirmed cases are from, issued a monthly figure on burials in the capital for March at 4,377, well above the monthly average of 2,745 burials last year and 2,774 burials the year before.

On April 2, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said 401 burials were conducted following the Covid-19 protocol. The national tally shows the fatality in Jakarta as only 99.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah is among currencies that have weakened sharply against the US dollar as the coronavirus crisis deepened. The rupiah fell 15 per cent year on year on April 6, while other currencies that have seen sharp falls in the same period include the Mexican peso, which dropped 26 per cent, and the Russian rouble, 19 per cent.

Some of these countries have spent a lot of their foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the currency markets. Experts, however, have argued that uncertainty and a lack of credibility pose the greatest threat to these countries' currency values, and improving transparency in their Covid-19 data and boosting testing rates would be the most effective measures to address their currency depreciation woes.",['16 tests'],,,

Indonesia’s coronavirus death toll rose to 170 on Thursday as the world’s fourth-most populous nation passed South Korea as the country with the highest number of recorded fatalities in Asia after China.

The country has confirmed 1,790 infections, while 7,193 tests have been performed out of a population more than 261 million of as of Thursday, far fewer than many smaller neighbours.

Ridwan Kamil, the governor of West Java, said his province had conducted more than 25,000 “rapid tests” and around 500 were positive, though they would need to undergo further tests to confirm the results. The population of West Java is close to 50 million.

Official data puts the number of infections in West Java at 223, while 25 have died.

The tests included 127 positive cases in a church in the district of Lembang, which Kamil described as the province’s “most worrying case.”

“Without massive testing, we wouldn’t have found this cluster,” Kamil said in an interview. “Other regions which report low cases are the same - maybe if they did more tests they would find more.

“Our campaign now, my input to all of Indonesia, is rapid tests, rapid tests, massive tests, until we’re sure that it’s indeed low,” he said, noting that he deployed police to ensure people at risk were tested.

Health experts say Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak.

Kamil also said that the provinces faced a big risk due to “mudik”, when tens of millions of people leave cities for their home towns and villages at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.

He cited two infected people in the province whose relatives later tested positive after they had returned from Jakarta, which is the epicentre for the outbreak in Indonesia.

“Imagine these two multiplying to thousands coming home to their hometowns and villagers,” he said.

Kamil said he would not ban mudik, but that those returning home would need to isolate themselves for two weeks or face penalties.

Government officials have said Indonesians would not be banned from travelling, but would be required to undergo medical checks if they joined mudik this year.

Health experts say Indonesia faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in the world’s fourth most populous country.

Indonesia has recorded 686 cases but the data is seen as understating the scale of infections because of a low rate of testing and a high mortality rate. Indonesia has reported 55 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.

A study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released on Monday estimates that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That would bring the true number to as many as 34,300, which is more than Iran.

Other modellers are projecting that cases could rise to as many as 5 million in the capital, Jakarta, by the end of April under a worst-case scenario.

“We have lost control, it has already spread everywhere,” Ascobat Gani, a public health economist told Reuters. “Maybe we will follow Wuhan or Italy. I think we are in the range of that”.

The government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.

“We won’t be like that,” said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China.

“What’s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.”

DOCTORS DYING

Indonesia’s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.

The country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.

Yurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.

However, Budi Haryanto, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia, told Reuters: “The hospitals are not ready to support the potential cases. Treatment will be limited.”

Although only hundreds of people have been hospitalised for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.

In a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.

In Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.

‘WE BRING OUR OWN MASKS’

Staff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.

“We bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,” the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“My friends, one by one, catch the virus,” he said, holding back tears.

The government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.

A new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.

Indonesia’s health system is highly decentralised, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.

A lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.

“If you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,” said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth’s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.

“If you don’t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.”

A study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data, found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.

It was just last month that Indonesia’s coronavirus cases stood at zero, with officials fiercely rejecting suggestions that infections were spreading undetected.

Weeks later, 78 fatalities have now been linked to the virus, the highest number in south-east Asia. Seven health workers are among those who have died.

While confirmed case have risen to almost 900, researchers have estimated that there could be tens of thousands of hidden infections across the country, and there is growing concern that medical facilities will be unable to cope in the event of a major outbreak.

Over the past week, two major hospitals have appealed for supplies, while some healthworkers threatened to go on strike after they were forced to wear raincoats for protection. As of Monday, as many as 42 medical staff were infected with coronavirus in Jakarta.

“I just pray and have faith so that I can stop worrying, even though sometimes that feeling (of worry) appears again,” Agnes Tri Harjaningrum, a paediatrician who works in state and private hospitals in the capital, told the Guardian. She fears the country could face a crisis similar to that experienced in Italy.

Donations of protective equipment and testing kits arrived from China on Monday morning, but by Tuesday night shortages remained in some of Jakarta’s hospital wards. Equipment is being prioritised for doctors who are directly handling patients, she said.

Indonesia, the world’s fourth most populous country, was slow to carry out tests, having reportedly performed only a few hundred earlier this month. While cases were detected throughout February in most countries across south-east Asia, it was not until 2 March that the country of 264 million people confirmed its first infections. A study by Harvard University, which analysed air traffic from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, had raised questions over the country’s previous lack of cases. The health minister responded at the time by describing the analysis as “insulting” and stating the country was on high alert.

The president has since acknowleged the need for mass testing, which is being ramped up in priority areas. So far 2,863 have been tested.

On Monday, it was estimated by academics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That could mean there are more than 34,000 cases. This is higher than the roughly 27,000 recorded in Iran – though the researchers also estimate that Iran may be identifying as little as 7.2% of its patients.

The researchers emphasise that these are rough estimates based on preliminary analysis and it is not yet peer reviewed.

There are some limitiations to the estimates. How a country’s demographics might affect the death toll from Covid-19, for example, has not yet been factored into the study. “Severity [of covid] is highly correlated with age, which means we need to account for it for it to be more accurate,” said Dr Timothy Russell, the lead author. With a median age of 28, Indonesia’s population is younger than many other affected countries.

According to official figures, the capital Jakarta, home to 9.6 million people, is among the worst hit, with hundreds of cases, while dozens of infections have also appeared in Banten and West Java.

Cases appear to be scattering. In West Papua, the easternmost province of Indonesia, three cases have been confirmed while 35 people have been put under surveillance because they have symptoms including pneumonia and have had contact with a confirmed patient.

Access to quality health care is limited in the province, especially in highland areas, and health workers are currently assessing patients online because of equipment shortages.

Analysis by Reuters suggests that the country’s health system is significantly less well resourced than that of Italy or South Korea, which have both faced major outbreaks.

Indonesia has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data, which is equal to about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.

Indonesia is converting the athlete’s village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital, which it is hoped will be able to treat 24,000 patients.

Modelling by the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit (EOCRU), reported by the Jakarta Post, has suggested that, without tough steps to contain the virus, there could be up to 71,000 infections by the end of April.

Jakarta’s governor has declared a state of emergency, and told businesses and religious groups to take measures to stop the spread of the virus. All tourism and entertainment venues have been closed, and public transport limited.

But while various lockdowns have been imposed in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, Indonesian president Joko Widodo has rejected calls for such measures. He has instead urged the public to stay at home and promised rapid testing. This is now being rolled out in three provinces, while 100,000 protective gears are also being distributed.

Zubairi Djoerban, head of the Indonesian Doctors Association coronavirus task force told the Guardian earlier this week that supplies will be distributed soon. “Private sector will help, businessmen will help.

Indonesia has recorded 1,677 cases of coronavirus as of April 1, and 157 deaths - the highest mortality rate in Southeast Asia.

Yet some health experts and officials believe the true infection rate among Indonesia’s population of 260 million could be substantially higher, while official data from mid-March shows the country has only about 12 hospital beds per 10,000 people.

Located on one of a chain of islands off Sumatra and south of Singapore, the new hospital includes 360 additional hospital beds, isolation facilities and helipads, and will be used to treat coronavirus patients and as a quarantine facility.

Indonesian President Joko Widodo said it would be open by next Monday at the latest.

“We’re hoping not to use these (beds), but we’ve prepared from the beginning, to brace for this,” said the president, as he toured the new facilities on the 16-hectare premise.

Amid a lack of proper protective equipment, some healthcare workers in Indonesia have worn raincoats to treat coronavirus patients. Twelve doctors have died, including one from exhaustion, said Halik Malik, spokesman for the Indonesian Doctors Association said on Wednesday.

Galang island was until 1996 a sprawling United Nations run refugee camp that housed 250,000 people that fled from the Vietnam War.

During his visit Widodo said the site could also be used to check Indonesian migrant workers returning home for ‘mudik’, the period following the Muslim fasting month when people return to their hometowns and villages across the archipelago.

Widodo’s tour of Galang came a day after he declared a national health emergency, and news that an 11-year-old girl had become the nation’s youngest fatality.

Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said via video conference on Wednesday that it was critical to strike a balance between preventative health and economic measures.

“Self-distancing measures, work from home, or limited isolation won’t work unless the people are given social security,” said Indrawati.

“This is just like what happened in India, when they announced a lockdown without any preparation, it instead caused chaos and other problems that complicated things further.”",,,['12 hospital beds'],
Pakistan,04-06-2020 15:35,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1654206/world,Pakistan braced for double blow of coronavirus outbreak,"KARACHI: Just a few days after he had returned from a visit to Iran, Yahya Jafri, a 22-year-old Pakistani national, became “patient zero” of Pakistan’s now explosive coronavirus outbreak.

Once he was diagnosed as having the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on Feb. 27, his family was moved to Aga Khan Hospital in Karachi, according to Meeran Yousuf, a spokesperson for Sindh province’s Health Department.

Around the same time several other Pakistanis returning from pilgrimage in Iran also tested positive for the virus, prompting authorities to suspend all flights to Iran.

Given the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, the move was perhaps a case of too little too late.

On March 25, Pakistan’s health minister claimed that 78 percent of the country’s total coronavirus patients had a history of travel to Iran.

“Every state defends its own interests first in such times,"" Umair Muhammad Hasni, a Balochistan government spokesperson, said while announcing the sealing of the border with Iran.

“Returning pilgrims are being pushed by Iran into a buffer zone between the two countries. We just cannot leave those people here.”

Iran has been accused by Gulf countries too of letting pilgrims depart without screening them for COVID-19 infection.

But that is scant comfort for a country of 220 million people reeling from a full-blown outbreak.

Pakistan’s cities have been under a partial lockdown for the past several weeks.

Schools, educational institutions, shopping malls and other usually crowded public places have been shut across the country.

After facing criticism for lacking a unified response to the public-health crisis, the government has extended a nationwide lockdown till April 14.

It has set aside economic concerns for now and suspended flights and business activities in an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19 infections.

Pakistan, like neighbor India, faces an uphill battle in its belated attempt to ""flatten the curve” of infections.

As of Sunday, the country had a total of 2,665 active COVID-19 cases, 45 deaths and 170 recoveries.

The government is getting flak for moving too slowly to stop large gatherings when the need of the hour is “social distancing” among other precautionary measures.

But as analysts have pointed out, the political leadership faces a painful choice between protecting public health and preventing an economic meltdown.

With blunt speeches, Prime Minister Khan is seeking to convince Pakistanis of the seriousness of the situation.

Attending a ceremony recently in Lahore, he said about 50-60 million of his compatriots are already below the poverty line and cannot afford to have two meals a day.

""Above these people are 50-60 million others, who are right at the border,” he said.

“If one misfortune befalls them, they are pushed below the poverty line.""

Pakistan was beset with problems ranging from an anemic economy and political dissension to dwindling investment flows when the coronavirus storm hit.

Now the challenge confronting the country is of a completely different order from anything it has dealt with in living memory.

Even the accuracy of the government’s coronavirus data is questioned by many Pakistanis.

Earlier this last week, Faisal Edhi, who heads Pakistan’s biggest charity, Edhi Foundation, accused officials, especially those in the largest province, Punjab, of underreporting COVID-19 cases.

“We are daily burying six to seven people with respiratory (illness) symptoms,” Edhi told Arab News.

A spokesperson of the Punjab health department rejected the charge, adding that COVID-19 deaths were not being concealed.

Edhi estimates that Punjab has 14,000 confirmed cases, a figure several times the number cited by provincial authorities.

As of March 31, according to official data, Punjab and Sindh had tested respectively 15,000 and 7,000 people for the coronavirus infection.

The corresponding figures for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces was 1,711 and 2,113.

Liaquat Shahwani, a Balochistan government spokesperson, said more tests will be conducted once the province receives 1,000 test kits from the federal government.

He said the official request was for 50,000 kits due to the large number of people affected by the outbreak in Balochistan.

Dr Zafar Mirza, the prime minister’s assistant on health issues, has said more than 15,000 people have been tested across the country.

“The country is rapidly increasing its capacity of testing and treatment to cope with the coronavirus pandemic,” he said.

For his part, Asad Umar, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, said “our testing capacity” has been increased from 30,000 to 280,000, and will be raised to 900,000 by mid-April.“

Saqib Mumtaz, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), said Pakistan has got ventilators and protective gears from China, adding that orders had been placed for another 3,000 ventilator units.

The UAE announced through its embassy in Islamabad that it had sent its first batch of medical supplies.

Even as foreign medical assistance begins to arrive, reports of new coronavirus cases are pouring in from across the country.

Each province is now enforcing its own partial or full lockdown in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly virus.

The Sindh government has established isolation centers in 12 different hospitals, having won praise for being the first to announce a lockdown with effect from March 23.

At the same time, it has placed a ban on Friday prayer gatherings for fear of local transmission, which accounts for most of the province’s 830 cases.

A number of quarantine and isolation facilities are also up and running across the country.

Punjab says that in addition to its quarantine capacity for 27,000 people, up to 100,000 patients can be treated in hospitals if the situation deteriorates further.

With “flattening the curve” of infections beyond the realm of imagination, Pakistan’s provincial governments and the national government have their work cut out for them.

In his address in Lahore, Khan said there is no denying that these are difficult times.

""It is difficult because no one has the experience to deal with such a crisis,” he said.

Khan noted that countries with far greater resources, competent institutions and well-funded health systems were reeling from the pandemic’s blow.

“The US has prepared a $2,000bn relief package whereas we can barely manage a $8bn one,” he said, pointing out that despite its resources, there is “a breakdown of (US) systems.”

Khan added: “If this is what can happen to them, our situation was dire to begin with.”","['1,000 test kits']",,,

Islamabad: Pakistan is rapidly increasing its capacity to strengthen the health sector to cope with coronavirus pandemic by setting up new labs, buying ventilators, testing kits and protective kits. The government has announced the new initiatives to contain the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 1,800 people in Pakistan so far.

The country has received 10 ventilators from China last week along with thousands of masks and testing kits. “China is sending another shipment which includes 16 ventilators and 5000 protection equipment set that will be delivered to doctors, nurses and paramedics fighting in the front line against the pandemic” Chairman of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Lt. Gen. Mohammed Afzal announced.

Pakistan to receive 1,000 ventilators in coming weeks

Pakistan has ordered nearly around 3000 ventilators from around the world and expects to receive at least 1200 within the next 10 days, NDMA chief informed during the March 30 press briefing. Furthermore, Pakistan would receive around 150 more ventilators next week, which have been donated by different countries. There are currently 2200 ventilators available in public hospitals for the critically ill patients.

Testing kits capacity enhanced

Pakistan’s testing capacity has been enhanced from 30,000 to 280,000 and would be further enhanced to 900,000 by mid April, the officials said on Tuesday. A day earlier, nearly 20,000 testing kits were dispatched to Sindh province, 5000 to Punjab, 4800 to Balochistan while there are 37,000 kits available to be provided as required and necessary. The country has performed nearly 15,000 coronavirus tests since the outbreak, according to Health Minister Dr Zafar Mirza.

Protective gears and thermal gates

Pakistani officials are hopeful that nearly 100,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) — the key medical gear — would arrive by April 6. Meanwhile, another order of 100,000 PPE sets is expected to arrive by mid April. Pakistan has also procured nearly 100 walk-through thermal gates to be placed at airport gates. Pakistan would have enough medical equipment, including personal protection kits, by April 5 to improve the safety of the health workers, officials say.

Testing labs to be increased to 50

To improve the testing capacity, NDMA is working in close collaboration with NIH to increase the existing number of coronavirus testing labs from 14 to 50 in next 20 days, according to the NDMA chief. The new testing labs would be set up in Islamabad, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, Rawalakot, Abbotabad, Sargodha, D I Khan, Gujrat and Bahawalpur in Punjab, two more in Sindh and Balochistan each, to cover a wider population.

Training programme for laboratory specialists

Pakistan is also beginning a training program for the paramedics and laboratory staff to overcome the shortcomings. Initially, NDMA would recruit 100 lab technicians with expertise in molecular biology. “We will offer 6-month contract to these lab technicians and if the program is successful then it will help overcome laboratories gaps for testing patients,” NDMA chief added.

All health workers in ICU to be immediately equipped

At least 16,700 PPE suits are being delivered to hospitals across the country. The government officials have assured that all of the 30,000 medical health practitioners working in intensive care unit (ICUs) would be equipped with a complete medical kit by early April. They would each be provided a set of face-shields, goggles, two N95 and 30 surgical masks, hand wash kit. Meanwhile, the number of beds in the intensive care unit (ICUs) has been increased to 19,670. The capacity of quarantine facilities has also been enhanced to 162,000 now.

Pakistan,04-06-2020 15:35,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1654206/world,Pakistan braced for double blow of coronavirus outbreak,"KARACHI: Just a few days after he had returned from a visit to Iran, Yahya Jafri, a 22-year-old Pakistani national, became “patient zero” of Pakistan’s now explosive coronavirus outbreak.

Once he was diagnosed as having the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on Feb. 27, his family was moved to Aga Khan Hospital in Karachi, according to Meeran Yousuf, a spokesperson for Sindh province’s Health Department.

Around the same time several other Pakistanis returning from pilgrimage in Iran also tested positive for the virus, prompting authorities to suspend all flights to Iran.

Given the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, the move was perhaps a case of too little too late.

On March 25, Pakistan’s health minister claimed that 78 percent of the country’s total coronavirus patients had a history of travel to Iran.

“Every state defends its own interests first in such times,"" Umair Muhammad Hasni, a Balochistan government spokesperson, said while announcing the sealing of the border with Iran.

“Returning pilgrims are being pushed by Iran into a buffer zone between the two countries. We just cannot leave those people here.”

Iran has been accused by Gulf countries too of letting pilgrims depart without screening them for COVID-19 infection.

But that is scant comfort for a country of 220 million people reeling from a full-blown outbreak.

Pakistan’s cities have been under a partial lockdown for the past several weeks.

Schools, educational institutions, shopping malls and other usually crowded public places have been shut across the country.

After facing criticism for lacking a unified response to the public-health crisis, the government has extended a nationwide lockdown till April 14.

It has set aside economic concerns for now and suspended flights and business activities in an effort to halt the spread of COVID-19 infections.

Pakistan, like neighbor India, faces an uphill battle in its belated attempt to ""flatten the curve” of infections.

As of Sunday, the country had a total of 2,665 active COVID-19 cases, 45 deaths and 170 recoveries.

The government is getting flak for moving too slowly to stop large gatherings when the need of the hour is “social distancing” among other precautionary measures.

But as analysts have pointed out, the political leadership faces a painful choice between protecting public health and preventing an economic meltdown.

With blunt speeches, Prime Minister Khan is seeking to convince Pakistanis of the seriousness of the situation.

Attending a ceremony recently in Lahore, he said about 50-60 million of his compatriots are already below the poverty line and cannot afford to have two meals a day.

""Above these people are 50-60 million others, who are right at the border,” he said.

“If one misfortune befalls them, they are pushed below the poverty line.""

The previous government in Pakistan, with its vision 2025, had envisioned embarking on the quest of finding and achieving potential of artificial intelligence in Pakistan. As part of this a project, spanning on three years, was launched, costing about 1.1 billion rupees. Under the shadow of Higher Education commission (HEC) nine labs are to be established throughout the country. In view of this, two labs are developed at NUST for Intelligent Robotics and Deep Learning, two at NED UET Karachi on Smart City and Neuro-computation, one at the CIIT to work on medical Imaging and diagnostics, one at UET Lahore on Intelligent Criminology and one at Punjab University of computational modeling. National Centre of Artificial Intelligence was launched back in March 2018.

Currently, the president of Pakistan, launched an initiative to educate the upcoming generation through the President’s initiative on Artificial intelligence (AI) and Computing (PIAIC), started in November 2018, offering opportunity to learning and developing business, in Blockchain, Cloud native and Artificial intelligence. The brainchild behind this vision was expressed in his Op-Ed in January 2019 published in The News, where he reemphasized the need for Pakistan to become a key player in “fourth” industrial revolution and the requirement to up its pace and efforts, in view of the current slow progress.

With the growing need of technology in our healthcare system, in most government run hospitals, this can be an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to cover and replace the shortage and gap of providing quality healthcare, through the use of artificial intelligence in the hour of need with the grave need due to corona virus disease (COVID 19) outbreak. Where many government and private organizations are offering grants from breakthrough discoveries that can help to fight the COVID 19 pandemic.

COVID 19 is a viral disease which at its severe form can lead into acute respiratory depression syndrome(ARDS). In such scenario, the patient requires invasive respiratory support such as mechanical ventilation. In studies from last flu pandemic extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) had a mortality benefit, in managing severe cases, compared to mechanical ventilation. This means that a patient with severe disease, supported on ECMO has a better chance of surviving.

Currently, according to recent media survey, Pakistan has about 2000 ventilators, with around 1300 ventilators in Punjab, 50 working ventilators in Balochistan, more than 500 in Sindh and 150 ventilators in Khyber Pakthunkhuwa, in a country of 210 million people, belonging from an under developed country. Whereas, there is no survey done about ECMOs, though, according to research citing, the use of ECMO is reported at, Aga Khan Hospital Karachi, Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology Rawalpindi and Institute of Cardiology Faisalabad, in Pakistan. Considering the fact that at the moment with 1975 patients diagnosed with COVID 19, till end of March, this resource is likely going to fall short by miles. Hence, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has announced that they are doing to procure 10,000 ventilators, though, no acquisition of ECMOs is announced.

While, we need these resources, we also need these experts. A ventilator and ECMO, in short, advance medical equipment which requires trained medical personnel, from consultants, nurses, pharmacists and respiratory therapists, with expertise in emergency and critical care. This short fall, can be managed with the use of AI, with collaboration with medical experts. Government of Pakistan in view of President’s initiative should mobilise its resources to generate AI that can help in successfully running these advance equipment and help bare the intensive care surge in hospitals with COVID 19 outbreak.

There could be an AI software that assists doctor to comprehend respiratory mechanics of a patient going towards ARDS, and when taken on mechanical ventilator, recommends settings according to the needs of the patient. There are examples of AI technology used in similar contexts such as CLiO2™ which is an automatic oxygen controller that keeps the oxygen level in the blood within a safe range for newborns needing mechanical ventilation. Many researches in west, of date, are trying to develop AI for predicting tools for severity score and mortality prediction, prediction of sepsis, and decisions to support mechanical ventilations, as to when to place a person or support and when to withdraw it in view of its need and likewise predict duration of ventilation, which is essential in management patients and resources in intensive care.

This is actually the time for Pakistan to take its efforts to the next level and utilise its limited resources, in best possible way, to save lives. Hence, with the use of AI, Pakistan can win in defeating the COVID at its front-line, the hospitals. The use of AI in management of severe cases is one side of it, there is always room to go beyond. In the recent interview, Prime Minister Imran Khan has mentioned using AI in surveillance of COVID 19 to predict its spread and outbreak in localities. Let us hope, they make more use of AI technology, within the present circumstances.",,"['2000 ventilators', '1300 ventilators', '10,000 ventilators', '150 ventilators']",,

Many companies have submitted designs and models of their own ventilators, which will be approved by a government-created committee after testing.

a Pakistani startup of Artificial Facial Intelligence has also quickly developed a ventilator that has been introduced to the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and Pakistan Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).

In order to cope with the shortage of ventilators in the country, the Government of Pakistan has taken rapid efforts to bring together all the relevant public and private companies and technology product companies on one platform, who are instructed to present designs and models of ventilators.

Following these guidelines, many companies have submitted designs and models of their own ventilators, which will be approved by a government-created committee after testing, in accordance with the prescribed criteria. After which preparation work will begin.

“Poulta"", a Pakistani startup of Artificial Intelligence (AI), has also quickly developed a ventilator that has been introduced to the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and Pakistan Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).

Ali Murtaza Solangi, founder and CEO of Poulta, said in an interview that although his company is not a ventilator company, it is a technology and AI company focused on improving the poultry farming industry. However, with the help of his team, he developed a smart and portable ventilator that can be monitored centrally, after making some tweaks in the existing systems and setups.

He said the problems for ordinary ventilators are who runs them? How to operate them? and people need to be trained to operate them. However, at this time it is not possible to have all of these resources immediately available in the emergency situation of the coronavirus. Therefore, they have developed a smart and portable ventilator that will be connected to a single center of many ventilators via the Internet, and with an automated system installed, the physician at any location can directly monitor the condition of any patient and take care of them accordingly.

He said that currently there is a shortage of ventilators worldwide and in Pakistan may not be able to get them immediately from other countries. If they are ordered from overseas, such ventilators cost from $10,000 to $12,000, while they have manufactured the same quality and similar ventilators for only $2200.

Referring to the characteristics of the ventilator he developed, he said that the ventilator provides patients with oxygen, heart rate per minute, carbon dioxide emissions, body temperature, blood pressure information on the web. And relevant doctors or staff from any location will be able to see this information and take care of the patient accordingly.

He said that the design and model of this ventilator have been submitted to the Pakistan Engineering Council and Disaster Management and if the team of experts approved their model, they would produce 500 to 1000 ventilators in just five weeks.",,['1000 ventilators'],,

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s government and private hospitals have a very small number of ventilators, which will be too deficient if there is a significant surge of new cases of coronavirus, data shows.

The key factor in mitigating strategy and effort of any country will be hospital capacity, and within such facilities two aspects are crucial – the number of beds available for patients who come with coronavirus complications and ventilators, which accompany those beds in intensive care units (ICUs).

The situation of ventilators which is a huge stress even on the health systems of developed and resource-rich countries is varied in Pakistan with picture varying from province to province.

Statistics shared by a health sector expert with The News reflects that public and private sectors of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) have around 150 ventilators. In Balochistan, all government hospitals put together have only 49 working ventilators.

According to the official record, Punjab’s public sector hospitals have nearly 1,300 ventilators, most of which were procured by the Shahbaz Sharif government in 2016-2018 when it had launched a project for revamping of tehsil and district hospitals.

In Lahore, the government hospitals have around 250 ventilators. However, the Punjab Kidney and Liver Institute (PKLI), which is a state-of-the-art facility and the brainchild of Shahbaz Sharif, alone has 100 brand new ventilators.

An official said the Punjab health department had done a stocktaking of ventilators in the private sector in Lahore and came to know that it has approximately 475 ventilators. However, the private hospitals of Lahore have 51 such machines. The previous government had provided 130 brand new ventilators to 25 district headquarter hospitals in 2017. It had planned to make available 140 ventilators to all tehsil level hospitals but the initiative was discontinued after 2018 by the new dispensation. The official said that private hospitals outside Lahore in large cities like Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan, Rawalpindi and Sialkot have some 150 ventilators in approximately 30 hospitals.

The health sector expert said in the light of these facts, one urgent step the government has to take is to purchase as many ventilators as possible in order to prepare for emergency situation. Both federal and provincial governments will have to allocate additional resources, he said.

However, another senior official, well conversant with development sector allocations, said that it was not only the issue of earmarking of resources but the capacity of health departments to procure ventilators and other much-needed equipment at top priority and expeditiously.

Reinforcing his claim with facts, the official said that the track record of the health ministry during the last two years is not very encouraging. The federal government for the second consecutive year is allocating hundreds of millions of rupees of funds to provide for every conceivable machine and equipment like MRI, ENT equipment, ophthalmology and nephrology and cardiology for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Islamabad but not a penny has been utilised.

Planning Minister Asad Umar, who was elected to the National Assembly from Islamabad and has keen interest in improvement of facilities at the PIMs, has expressed his displeasure over the state of affairs in the Health Ministry where concerned officers are again prepared to surrender the earmarked funds, unutilized, rather than purchasing the direly required medical equipment.

When this state of affairs was put to a senior bureaucrat, he recommended to get hold of young civil servants, who did emergency procurement in Punjab as the present health ministry and PIMs bureaucracy may not measure up to the challenge.

In 2016-2018, the Punjab government had procured ventilators at around $13,000 per instrument with built-in compressor. Price may be higher now with huge global demand in view of the spread of coronavirus. The United States, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland and Japan are major manufacturers of ventilators. A doctor explained that a ventilator is a machine designed to provide mechanical ventilation by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths to a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently. It is critical and essential equipment for any ICU. Major complication of coronavirus affected patient is breathing difficulty especially in old and infirm and people already suffering for underlying ailments, the doctor said.

All countries affected by coronavirus are doing an urgent stocktaking of ventilators that their health systems have. Even the well-resourced system like Italy is finding it challenging to provide ventilators in large numbers, which should be commensurate with the number of serious patients. It is stated that even the United States does not have enough ventilators and ICU beds if there’s a noteworthy surge of new cases. As with Italy, the health system could become overwhelmed.

Many experts are doubting the ability of existing health systems to absorb the shock, what is called the surge capacity, meaning ability to handle serious patients, who need intensive care especially through ventilators.

So, the million dollar question is: will there be enough ventilators as the pandemic spreads? As the coronavirus spreads, there are continuing concerns among hospitals, public health experts and government leaders that ICUs would be hard-pressed to handle a surge in seriously ill patients.

A key limiting factor to provide good care, experts say, is the number of ventilation machines, a hospital has on hand to help the most seriously ill patients breathe.

A pulmonary disease expert explains the coronavirus like many respiratory viruses can cause inflammation in the lungs. When the lungs become inflamed, the membranes that transfer oxygen from the air into the blood become blocked.

When patients develop this type of viral pneumonia, they often require bedside ventilators, which can supply higher levels of oxygen, help push air into the lungs to open them up, and afford more opportunity to get oxygen into the patient, he said.

Ventilators are generally a temporary bridge to recovery of patients in critical care, who need them to get better. These machines can be crucial to sustaining life in certain emergency situations. If there is a surge in seriously ill patients as COVID-19 spreads, ventilators could be in short supply from hospital to hospital or nationally.

The railway company says overall it has converted 220 coaches with a total capacity of as many as 2,000 hospital beds.



Railway Minister Shaikh Rashid Amad told reporters Monday these mobile facilities can now be sent to any part of the country with rail service to help ease pressure on health care services in that area.

This shows how insignificant geographical boundaries have become and how the consequences of human actions are not limited to national borders. Any country that does not take the necessary precautions advised by health experts will soon be walloped by the disease. As Ph.D. students at George Mason University in the United States who are witnessing the flippant manner in which Pakistanis are reacting to the pandemic, the observation raises red flags and serious concerns for Pakistanis.

Leading global experts agree on the necessity of good hygiene and social distancing to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

Social distancing, which is basically physical distancing, is the practice of reducing physical contact with anyone outside of close family and avoiding large social gatherings. In Pakistan, social distancing has been a significant challenge. Pakistan recently recorded 1,022 confirmed coronavirus cases and eight deaths and that number is increasing.

Pakistan has all of the conditions that would allow the coronavirus pandemic to run rampant.

First, the geostrategic location of Pakistan as a gateway to Central Asia and the Middle East makes it vulnerable to transmission of the disease.

Second, Pakistan borders the two most affected countries—China and Iran, both with frequent social, religious, and economic tourism with Pakistan. Moreover, there is a strong Chinese presence in Pakistan due to China’s Built Road Investment (BRI) in the country.

Third, the official response toward the pandemic has been insufficient at best. The prime minister of Pakistan, who has responded to the pandemic poorly, stated in a televised address to the nation that the country could not afford to take an economic break by enforcing social distancing. Furthermore, officials mishandled the infected pilgrims returning from Iran. Consequently, in the absence of a bona fide crisis response, the public is churning out myths and conspiracy theories and turning to totkay (sorcery and unscientific treatments) for coronavirus.

Fourth, communal gatherings and social settings are a lifeline for Pakistanis, thus offering the pandemic more infesting grounds if these are not restricted.

Lastly, Pakistan is a densely-populated country. For comparison, Pakistan is geographically close to fourteen times smaller than the United States, but it has a population of about 220 million compared to the United States’ population of 330 million. This considerable population and crowded spaces are what coronavirus requires for its transmission.

Analyses predict that physical distancing would flatten the curve, which projects its future transmission, thus reducing the health-care burden. What this means in practice is that health providers will not become overwhelmed. Comparing numbers from cities enforcing distancing with those from cities not applying or delaying distancing substantiate the recommendations. For instance, research on the Italy outbreak shows the effectiveness of early action. The coronavirus disease was first detected in Italy, in the Lodi province, which imposed restrictions starting February 22. Whereas, Bergamo province, which started with fewer cases but did not enact restrictions until March 7, far surpassed the number of cases in Lodi.

Beyond the confirmed 1,022 cases, the number of undiagnosed cases is likely to be much higher because of people’s reluctance to get diagnosed, stigmatization, and the scarcity of resources. With a high transmission factor, researchers predict that the actual number of infected people in the United States would be ten times to hundred times the confirmed number. Considering undiagnosed cases existing in Pakistan to be ten times the official number, there may be as many as forty-five hundred active cases today. A compelling prediction suggests that community spread could increase the active cases to eighty thousand in a month.

Is the health-care system in Pakistan equipped to deal with the coronavirus outbreak? The numbers suggest that it is not.

According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the country has close to 1.5 million beds available. Not only is this number inadequate, but the ratio of general to intensive care unit (ICU) beds is also concerning. The WHO recommends a 50:1 ratio of general wards to ICU beds, and there must be a trained nurse for each bed in the ICU. A leading news agency of Pakistan reports that the number of ICU beds in twelve major tertiary care hospitals in the largest province Punjab adds up to only 250. One of the largest hospitals of Punjab, Jinnah Hospital, has thirty-four ICU beds out of a capacity of 1250 beds. In addition, there is only one nurse available to serve two thousand people in Pakistan. According to the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority Pakistan (NDMA), the country has a total of 1,700 ventilators available to fight the coronavirus. Several reports highlight the current poor state of medical equipment in the country, which is more dire in rural areas.

In the face of an exponential rise in the number of coronavirus cases, the country will witness an acute shortage of beds, health personnel, and medical equipment.

Given the premise, Pakistan still does not realize the severity of the situation. Markets are bustling. People are partying. Greetings rituals do not suffice with a handshake, people also hug at every encounter.

Even though Muslim countries across the world and the Middle East have closed mosques for daily and Friday prayers, many of Pakistan’s hardliners are still debating whether or not shutting down congregational activities in the mosques is illicit.

The fact is that the pandemic will not disappear any time soon. We are all likely to be targets or carriers of the disease at some point. Thus, we must reorient our behavior in favor of collective interest. While researchers try to investigate this virus, one effective strategy, as learned from Italy and other countries, is to observe a lockdown and to quarantine (or practice distancing from others).

A lockdown can only be fruitful if people are willing to accept it. The sooner Pakistan implements a lockdown and enforces quarantine, the sooner it can contain a community spread. In this regard, public gatherings of all sorts should be banned. Offices should give employees the facility to work from home. Ensuring social safeguards such as the provision of food to daily wage earners should be a central part of the lockdown strategy. In addition to observing quarantine and lockdown procedures, proper hygiene must be practiced to prevent the spread of the pandemic.

Importantly, in a country where ulemas (religious scholars) are revered and looked up to for guidance, they should play a decisive role in educating the public while drawing from authenticated guidance. In particular, they should remind the people that Prophet Muhammad advised that people from communities with an epidemic disease may not leave and those from healthy communities should not enter the inflicted communities. Similarly, they should remind people of the Hadith (the Holy Prophet’s saying) about proper hygiene practices, for example, the Holy Prophet said that the blessings of food lie in washing hands before and after eating. For those who overemphasize the congregational prayers while undermining the necessary precautions (social distancing for instance) either by mocking or stigmatizing others, ulema should narrate the following story, conveyed by ninth-century scholar Imām Al-Tirmidhi:

One day, Prophet Muhammad saw a Bedouin man leaving his camel without tying it. He asked the Bedouin, “Why don’t you tie down your camel?” The Bedouin responded, “I put my trust in God.” The Prophet then said, “Tie your camel first, then put your trust in God.” This story indicates the significance religion attaches to the adoption of precautionary measures.

The precautionary measures are for the safety and well-being of not only our families and communities but are also consequential to those separated by human-made borders. While the researchers are working hard to come up with a cure to combat the pandemic, a piece of simple yet potent and universal age-old advice is to focus on prevention.

Since anyone exposed to the coronavirus can be a silent carrier, physical or social distancing seems a reasonable strategy for the greater good. Research suggests that young and healthy individuals can develop immunity to the disease yet they can unknowingly transmit it to others, including the elderly and those with a vulnerable immune system. Therefore, the higher and longer prevalence of the virus could strain the already burdened healthcare system in the United States and Pakistan as it has already significantly harmed many social capacities. We all must act quickly to combat the coronavirus pandemic effectively.

To avoid transmitting the disease, people in Pakistan, the United States, and other countries must assume that they are carriers of the disease and change their behavior as such—at least until the global community can figure out other ways to cope with the virus. This attitude should shape our narratives and collective action. It should lead to limiting physical meetups and interactions, among other things.

Khan, a daily wage worker, has not earned a rupee in more than two weeks as Pakistan battles an outbreak of the coronavirus that has seen more than 1,000 people infected, forcing a countrywide lockdown.

""I'm only out here out of hunger, I have no other reason,"" says the 46-year-old man. ""I am a sick man, I had typhoid five or six months ago, and am still suffering.""

Pakistan's government has imposed varying restrictions across the country, in part, Prime Minister Imran Khan has said, to safeguard the incomes of daily wage workers such as Shireen Khan.

In Islamabad, public gatherings are banned, schools are closed and all shops other than those selling groceries or medicines have been shut down.

Other provinces and regions are following a largely similar model, with Sindh province, which has the highest number of cases - at least 410, enforcing a stricter lockdown with full city shutdowns mandated between 8pm and 8am every night, starting on Wednesday.

""A lockdown is not a curfew,"" PM Khan reiterated in a news conference on Tuesday evening. ""When you enforce a curfew, what will your poorest segment of society do?""

Shireen Khan, and more than a dozen others who were waiting for work beside him, however, say that the ""lockdown"" may as well be a curfew, because no one is offering them work.

""A lockdown is necessary [to control the virus outbreak],"" he says. ""But we need to be taken care of as well.""

Rising number of cases

On Wednesday, Pakistan's countrywide tally of cases stood at 1,005, with 14 patients having recovered and seven fatalities, according to government data. The number of cases has more than tripled in a week.

Authorities have been scrambling to control the spread of the virus, although they do not yet appear to be at a level that could overwhelm Pakistan's fragile healthcare system.

On Wednesday, PM Khan reiterated that he has been delaying announcing a countrywide shutdown to safeguard the economic interests of the poorest Pakistanis, who he says need to work to earn a living.

Observers, however, say that work has already dried up with the current level of restrictions.

""The wider concern that a slowdown in economic activity would knock people's daily wages off, would evaporate the work that daily wagers do, that is already coming to fruition,"" says Mosharraf Zaidi, a senior fellow at the Tabadlab policy think-tank.

""Daily wage labourers require sites and opportunities that demand their skills or input. But when there is a lockdown, all economic activity, construction activity […] all of those activities have been suspended.""

On Wednesday, however, the government announced it would be disbursing 12,000 rupees ($75) to low-income earners, affecting an estimating 67 million people, as part of a $940m economic stimulus package.

Procuring more PPE

Healthcare specialists say there is cause for concern if the number of coronavirus cases spikes in the densely populated South Asian nation of more than 200 million.

""We're on a very low scale, in terms of infrastructure,"" says Dr Shamail Daud, a healthcare management specialist. ""Healthcare is very disintegrated and not very high in terms of quality or dealing with high levels of critical care for patients, which is unfortunately an outcome of COVID-19.""

While there are a limited number of ventilators available countrywide, Daud says a bigger problem could be a lack of enough doctors to operate them in the event of a spike in cases.

""Other than the functionality of the ventilators, the staff that actually works with it, the critical care staff [...] is very limited,"" he warns. ""In every city, there is a shortage. […] The issue is not about the machines themselves, it is about the people who can make them work.""

Earlier this week, several doctors told Al Jazeera that there are not enough personal protective equipment (PPE) kits to go around, leaving many front-line healthcare workers without adequate protection.

On Wednesday, Lieutenant General Muhammad Afzal, chairman of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), said the government was working on procuring more PPE and other medical equipment. The country needed more than 4,000 additional ventilators, Afzal told the press, but manufacturers were no longer taking additional orders.

In all, there are currently 41 hospitals across the country offering more than 119,000 hospital beds in isolation wards, according to government data. In addition, hospitals and ad hoc facilities are offering more than 162,000 beds in quarantine facilities, the data shows.

Badly managed quarantine facilities, however, have been at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak in Pakistan. At least 51 percent of all cases in Pakistan can be traced back to the Taftan quarantine camp, where thousands of Pakistanis returning from Iran - one of the countries worst-hit by the virus - were pooled together in a single space, without adequate screening.

""They put all those people together into a herd, and that resulted in cross infections,"" says Dr Daud. ""Then eventually, without testing [all of them], they released them after the 14th day.""

Those released from Taftan were transferred to separate provincial quarantine camps, where they have now been tested and are being screened before release. To date, more than 6,304 people have passed through the Taftan camp, with at least 516 of them testing positive for the virus.

'I went to bed hungry'

Back in Islamabad, which has recorded at least 16 cases, the streets of the capital are largely deserted, with shops in normally busy commercial areas shuttered and police enforcing lockdown orders.

In the G9 Markaz market - one of the city's central locations for working-class shoppers - there is hardly any traffic, as children play cricket in what is normally a packed car park, raising questions over whether social distancing guidelines are properly being followed, despite government orders.

""I am not allowing my father to leave the house,"" says Noor Ahmed, a daily wage labourer who lives with his 80-year-old father, his wife and son, in a single rented room. ""What else can I do?""

For those earning a daily wage, it appears, the future remains uncertain - whether it is a lockdown or a curfew that they are under.

Speed is critical in the response to COVID-19. So why has the United States been so slow in its attempt to develop reliable diagnostic tests and use them widely?

The World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases—and test them faster—have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.

In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.

The problems have led many to doubt that the official tally of 60 confirmed cases in the United States is accurate. “There have been blunders, and there could be an underlying catastrophe that we don’t know about,” says epidemiologist Michael Mina, who helps run a microbiology testing lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. “It’s been very complicated and confusing for everyone with almost no clarity being provided by the CDC.”

The situation may soon improve. State labs and commercial diagnostic developers hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their own tests, and FDA and CDC on Wednesday agreed on a workaround for the faulty CDC kit—which has a problem that is not essential to its proper functioning—so that it can now be used by at least some of the state labs that have it. But there’s widespread discontent with the way the system has worked. “The U.S. government has not appropriately prioritized diagnostic tests and supported the laboratory response network to the degree they should have been supported over the years,” says Luciana Borio, who in previous jobs had lead roles in responding to emerging threats at the National Security Council and FDA. If a new disease emerges, CDC normally “gets the ball rolling” with diagnostics because it has the expertise and the biosafety laboratories to handle dangerous novel pathogens, says Borio, who now works for In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit venture capital firm. Typically, there are few confirmed viral samples from patients at the outset, which researchers need to validate their tests, and CDC has the capability to grow the virus for this critical quality assurance step. Once the agency has a working test, that goes out to state labs. Then, in a third phase, commercial labs take over and either produce their own tests or scale-up the CDC one. “I would have hoped to see that third phase by now,” Borio says. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus causing COVID-19 is officially known, CDC’s sluggishness was apparent 1 month ago. On 26 January, the agency held an unusual Sunday teleconference for the media to provide an update about the rapidly growing outbreak. There were then five cases in the United States, but the CDC lab in Atlanta was still the only one in the country able to test for the virus, and it repeatedly had backlogs. Asked why more labs weren’t able to do the tests, Nancy Messonnier, who then was leading CDC’s response, said it was a quality issue. “We hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard of precision in terms of laboratory testing,” Messonnier said. “We wouldn’t want to inadvertently make a mistake in patient care.” CDC finally started to send kits to state and local health labs on 5 February. But on 12 February, it revealed that several labs had difficulty validating the test because of a problem with one of the reagents. The key problem with the kits is what’s known as a negative control, says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL). CDC’s test uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to find tiny amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in, say, a nose swab. To make sure a test is working properly, kits also include DNA unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The assay should not react to this negative control, but the CDC reagents did at many, but not all, state labs. The labs where the negative control failed were not allowed to use the test; they have to continue to send their samples to Atlanta.

The declaration of a public health emergency … limited the diagnostic capacity of this country. It’s insane. Michael Mina, Brigham and Women’s Hospital

In principle, many hospital and academic labs around the country have the capability to carry out tests themselves. The PCR reaction uses so-called primers, short stretches of DNA, to find viral sequences. The CDC website posts the primers used in its test, and WHO publicly catalogs other primers and protocols, too. Well-equipped state or local labs can use these—or come up with their own—to produce what are known as a “laboratory-developed tests” for in-house use.",['459 tests'],,,

Health experts say Indonesia faces a surge in coronavirus cases after a slow government response masked the scale of the outbreak in the world’s fourth most populous country.

Indonesia has recorded 686 cases but the data is seen as understating the scale of infections because of a low rate of testing and a high mortality rate. Indonesia has reported 55 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.

A study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released on Monday estimates that as few as 2% of Indonesia’s coronavirus infections have been reported. That would bring the true number to as many as 34,300, which is more than Iran.

Other modellers are projecting that cases could rise to as many as 5 million in the capital, Jakarta, by the end of April under a worst-case scenario.

“We have lost control, it has already spread everywhere,” Ascobat Gani, a public health economist told Reuters. “Maybe we will follow Wuhan or Italy. I think we are in the range of that”.

The government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.

“We won’t be like that,” said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China.

“What’s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.”

DOCTORS DYING

Indonesia’s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.

The country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

In 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.

Yurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.

However, Budi Haryanto, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia, told Reuters: “The hospitals are not ready to support the potential cases. Treatment will be limited.”

Although only hundreds of people have been hospitalised for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.

In a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.

In Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.

‘WE BRING OUR OWN MASKS’

Staff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.

“We bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,” the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“My friends, one by one, catch the virus,” he said, holding back tears.

The government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.

A new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.

Indonesia’s health system is highly decentralised, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.

A lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.

“If you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,” said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth’s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.

“If you don’t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.”

A study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data, found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.

Brazil is bracing for a surge in coronavirus cases as doctors and researchers warn that underreporting and a lack of testing mean nobody knows the real scale of Covid-19’s spread.

“What’s happening is enormous underreporting,” said Isabella Rêllo, a doctor working in emergency and intensive care in Rio de Janeiro hospitals, in a widely shared Facebook post challenging official numbers. “There are MANY more,” she wrote.

As Latin America’s worst hit country, Brazil officially has 9,056 coronavirus cases – including actors, singers, government ministers and Fabio Wajngarten, press secretary of the president, Jair Bolsonaro.

With 14 million Brazilians living in densely populated favelas where basic sanitation is frequently lacking, informal workers are struggling from lost income during lockdown, and social isolation is challenging or impossible. The first case has already been reported in an Amazon indigenous community.

The number of critically ill patients I see, and that people I know tell me about, does not match the number disclosed Dr Isabella Rêllo

Bolsonaro called the pandemic a “little flu” and insisted Brazilians would be immune because they were used to jumping in sewage. His government has distributed just 54,000 tests for a population of about 210 million. Last month the health ministry stopped releasing the numbers of suspected cases.

“In Brazil that’s certainly a critical issue, if not a crisis,” said Albert Ko, department chair and professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, noting that widespread testing helped Taiwan, South Korea and Germany blunt the epidemic’s rise.

“It is clear we have to improve the issue of tests, and improve a lot,” health minister Luiz Mandetta told reporters this week.

Estimates vary wildly. This week, Edmar Santos, health secretary for Rio de Janeiro, said the state could have 50 to 100 infected people for each of its 1,074 confirmed cases.

Brazil’s official toll of 359 deaths is just “the tip of the iceberg,” said Fernando Bozza, a researcher in infectious diseases at the government research institute Fiocruz who is modelling the pandemic. “You have a mountain of other deaths that are either directly or indirectly associated with the epidemic and they are not notified.”

Rêllo, who works in private and public hospitals in Rio, said test results can take up to seven days to arrive. She dealt with three deaths last week alone but results confirming coronavirus arrived after the patients had died – meaning they did not enter the count. The notification systems she deals with vary from handwritten forms to online ones.

“I’m just one doctor,” she said. “The number I am seeing of critically ill patients, of what I see and what people I know tell me about, does not match the number being disclosed.”

She and other doctors are worried about running short of personal protection equipment before the full force of the pandemic has hit.

“It’s chaotic, many cases arriving,” said Rodolfo Espinoza, a doctor working in Rio’s intensive care wards. “We know there are many suspected cases with no diagnosis.”

In São Paulo state, Brazil’s most populous with 44 million people and 4,048 cases, the government laboratory handling tests has a backlog of 16,000, state health secretary José Germann said on Wednesday.

At the Emílio Ribas public hospital in the state capital, tests are taking up to 15 days to come back, said Ana Ribeiro, its epidemiological service coordinator. The hospital – one of Brazil’s most respected infectious disease institutions – is currently waiting for 134 test results, including those of three who have died.

“There are many people getting symptoms and they cannot handle it,” Ribeiro said.

Cemeteries in São Paulo are burying 30 to 40 people a day with coronavirus symptoms but, in most cases, no test result, the Folha de S Paulo newspaper reported.

If diagnosis does not improve, there will be a lot of underreporting in the favelas of Rio. This is extremely worrying Rodrigo Brindeiro, molecular biologist

The non-profit group Viva Rio runs six health centres, called UPAs, in Rio de Janeiro, all near favelas and all almost exclusively dealing with respiratory cases.

“People are not going to UPAS for other reasons,” said general coordinator José Pacheco. “I just select the most vulnerable or most serious to test; the vast majority are not tested.”

São Gonçalo, the second biggest city in Rio state, has 10 confirmed cases. Resident Fabíola Lima, a financial specialist, believes there are many more.

She lives with her three sisters, all of whom went to private hospitals after suffering classic coronavirus symptoms like fever, headaches and dry coughs. They were told tests were not available, and sent home. They too were not included in the official tally.

“This number being released is totally unreal. This makes people think everything’s normal,” Lima said, while her sister Christiane, coughed incessantly in the background.

Despite outbreaks of Zika, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever in recent years, the past three Brazilian governments slashed funding for science and technology, said Rodrigo Brindeiro, a molecular biologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro who helped design the test Fiocruz uses.

Brazil is now competing in international markets to buy the test ingredients it needs.

“Our failure was long-term,” he said. “We know that if the diagnosis does not improve rapidly there will be a lot of underreporting in these favelas of Rio and this is extremely worrying.”

In an email, the health ministry said 40,000 more molecular tests were being delivered this week and another 15 million “are being acquired”. It has taken delivery of half a million antibody tests donated by mining giant Vale, which is expected to deliver millions more. Mandetta said the antibody tests have “various degrees of sensitivity”. Health ministry documents sent to states and towns said the tests were probably just 25% accurate in diagnosing negative cases.

These antibody tests will only spot people carrying coronavirus four to seven days after they become infected, said Brindeiro.

As Brazilians chafed under lockdown and largely ignored Bolsonaro’s demands to get back to work, there are signs that many people also sought reliable information instead of his anti-science, anti-media, populist posturing. Brazil’s biggest newspaper, the Folha de S Paulo – which Bolsonaro has described as “garbage” – reported a record 70 million readers in March.

An interview with biologist Atila Iamarino Iamarino on the TV show Roda Viva this week drew its biggest audience since Bolsanaro himself appeared in 2018, and has been viewed 3 million times on YouTube.

Concerns over the lack of testing were voiced.

“You have the tests, which are the flashlight you can point in any direction and know what’s happening there,” said Iamarino. “Without this flashlight, what you can use is a candle.”","['54,000 tests']",,,

RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian health officials grappling with the new coronavirus outbreak have issued a stark warning about a lack of hospital beds, masks, testing devices and trained staff across Latin America's largest nation.

A Health Ministry report issued on Friday said Brazil can currently carry out 6,700 COVID-19 tests a day, but that it will need to process as many as 30,000–50,000 tests daily during the peak of the outbreak, expected in June.

This latest assessment of the public healthcare system raises serious questions about its capacity to face the outbreak in a country of nearly 210 million. It also calls for the maintenance of quarantine measures in states that are most badly hit, challenging President Jair Bolsonaro's more laid-back approach to the virus.

Bolsonaro has compared the new coronavirus to a “little flu” and publicly attacked governors that introduced quarantine measures, such as in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, two of the country’s biggest clusters.

As of Saturday afternoon, the health ministry had reported 10,278 confirmed cases and 431 deaths. But the outbreak is still in its early phase, the report said, and the country's hospitals are not ready to handle a peak.

Officials pointed to a shortage in trained health professionals “to handle mechanical ventilation equipment, respiratory physiotherapy and advanced nursing care” for critically ill patients, while intensive care units and general hospitalization beds are “not properly structured or in sufficient numbers.”

The assessment, done in compliance with World Health Organization directives, said logistical issues had prevented hospitals from acquiring sufficient personal protective equipment, ""placing workers in an important risk group”.

Authorities are seeking partnerships between the public and private sectors to address shortages in testing capacities, but such agreements would not bear fruit for at lest another two weeks they said.

Officials say past studies of influenza, another respiratory disease caused by viral infection, show that Brazil's continental size and varied climates – temperate, subtropical and equatorial – mean the COVID-19 disease will likely spread and peak at different times of the year, in different regions, making it more challenging for authorities to prepare a national plan.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

Bolsonaro has increasingly isolated himself politically by maintaining that jobs and the economy must prevail and that Brazil ”cannot stop.”

His message and public appearances showing him with supporters are at odds with recommendations from Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta. Tensions between the two men have risen as Mandetta, until recently a largely unknown technocrat, emerged as a reassuring figure in the midst of a public health crisis.

The minister has garnered support among Brazilians with daily updates on the coronavirus, filled with technical details, best practices and recommendations from authorities such as the World Health Organization.

In a radio interview, Bolsonaro said his health minister lacked “humility"". Mandetta, asked about the president's declaration, said he would not quit: “A doctor does not abandon his patient.""

In Friday's report, the health ministry urged all states to maintain self-isolation measures. “Social distancing strategies adopted by states and municipalities contribute to avoiding the collapse of local health systems,” the report said, citing efforts to fight the virus in Italy, Spain, China and New York City.","['50,000 tests']",,,
Brazil,,https://time.com/5816243/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-governors/,Brazil's President Still Insists the Coronavirus Is Overblown. These Governors Are Fighting Back,"Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro is in a class of his own. He is the only leader left in the world to reject the consensus of scientists and statisticians on the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak.

The far-right firebrand, who was elected in 2018 trading on conspiracy theories and half truths, has dismissed COVID-19 as a “little flu” and remarked that “we all die someday.” He has flouted his own health ministry’s guidance by going on walkabouts to greet supporters and has urged Brazilians to leave isolation and return to work, defying the advice of the World Health Organization.

Now, Brazil’s leader has himself been isolated by an unprecedented alliance of key ministers in his federal government, congressional leaders, and 24 of the country’s 27 governors, who have substantial power in a decentralized structure similar to the U.S. “I can say the governors across Brazil have never been as united as we are now,” João Doria, the center-right governor of São Paulo, who has emerged as a key opposition figure, tells TIME. His southeastern state, which has 46 million residents and a third of Brazil’s GDP, has suffered more than 80 percent of the country’s hospitalizations for Covid-19 and is racing to ameliorate the crisis.

“The president despises us and attacks us. He has put us in an impossible position by creating a narrative that impedes the protection of people and life,” he adds. “The governors – from the left, center and right – have decided to follow the correct path and maintain the WHO protocols.”

As of April 6, Brazil had reported 11,490 cases of the virus and 492 deaths. To try to slow that rate Doria and Wilson Witzel, his counterpart in the neighboring state of Rio de Janeiro, are among the majority of governors who have imposed strict isolation rules in their states, including suspending schools, prohibiting intercity buses, shutting down shops, bars and beaches and canceling concerts. All but three of Brazil’s 27 states have brought in similar measures. Vice President Hamilton Mourão and Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta have also continued to urge caution at least until the pandemic reaches its likely peak here in late April.

In response Bolsonaro, who says isolation will cost jobs, shared a video calling the governors “a bunch of scoundrels,” threatened to fire Mandetta and revealed he had already prepared a draft decree to order the country back to work. “Nobody should forget I am the president,” he said. The far right leader, who made his career glorifying Brazil’s 1964-1985 dictatorship, was also asked if he might use the ensuing crisis to mount a coup. He replied: “If I was I wouldn’t say so.”

Brazil recorded its first case of COVID-19 in late January, but the numbers did not begin to grow until late February. On March 7, Bolsonaro dined with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Upon returning to Brazil, 25 of his entourage tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro’s son Eduardo told Fox News his father had also contracted the virus, then later denied that was the case.

Doria, who says he has tested negative for the virus three times while working 16-hour days, spoke to TIME on the phone from São Paulo. “It’s a dramatic situation and happening at tremendous speed. We are running out of time to isolate, guide and treat people,” he says. The country’s 27 governors have held video conferences to make plans, excluding the president.

São Paulo has opened an emergency hospital with 200 beds in a sports stadium and another with 1,800 beds is planned. “He is putting people’s lives at risk,” Doria says of Bolsonaro’s walkabouts in Brasília. “The president is doing nothing to combat the crisis and preserve lives.”

Brazil is ostensibly well equipped to manage a major national outbreak. It has 21 ICU beds for every 100,000 people, about double the proportion of such beds in Italy, France and Spain. But only half are in the public hospitals which 76% of Brazilians use and in some states the public system has less than a tenth of the capacity of private hospitals. The resources are also poorly distributed, with less than a quarter of Brazilian municipalities having public ICU beds. There are also fears for the spread of the virus in tightly-packed favelas and indigenous communities.

“Rio de Janeiro has communities with a high population density and many vulnerable people,” says Witzel, the governor of that state. “These are densely occupied areas, and our concern is a very fast contagion. By controlling the curve we will give these people conditions to survive. The human tragedy in Ecuador, with bodies on the streets, can happen if measures are not taken.” Guayaquil, Ecuador’s largest city, has emerged as a regional hotspot for the coronavirus, overwhelming local authorities, funeral homes, and hospitals.

Popular frustration at Bolsonaro has grown. The clang of Brazilians banging pots and pans in anger from their windows in big cities became a nightly ritual. A recent poll shows 76% of Bolsonaro’s voters support isolation measures even at the expense of the economy, though a majority of Bolsonaro voters continue to support the president. Multiple impeachment requests have been submitted to congress and a manifesto calling for his resignation has accused Bolsonaro of being the “biggest obstacle to making urgent decisions to reduce the spread of contagion, save lives and guarantee the income of families, jobs and companies.”

“The country needs to find a path that guarantees democracy and avoids social chaos that may result from Bolsonaro’s attitude,” says Flávio Dino, the leftwing governor of the northeastern state of Maranhão and the only governor so far to sign the manifesto. “The president’s popularity is declining fast, not because of the opposition, but because of his own mistakes.”

“It is very difficult to believe in his sincerity, seriousness and loyalty. It is already really difficult under normal conditions to govern like this [without dialogue with the federal government]. Imagine it in the exceptional and serious conditions we are experiencing now.”

Witzel, who rode from obscurity to his election in 2018 as part of Bolsonaro’s then party but has threatened anyone in Rio breaking isolation rules with arrest, says the same fate should await the president. “Everyone here whose disobedience puts people’s health at risk is being charged with a crime,” he says. “The President must also answer to that, to the Supreme Court.”

Doria, a millionaire former presenter of the Brazilian version of The Apprentice who has long been rumoured to covet the presidency himself, has struck a populist tone in recent weeks, telling TIME he would not be blackmailed by businesses threatening to fire employees if they could not open as “we will not exchange profits for lives.”

The governors also argue for the immediate payment of a $115 emergency monthly income for informal workers, the self-employed and those without a fixed income. Bolsonaro reluctantly signed that bill into law on Wednesday but red tape is threatening to hold it up. “Each day that is lost there is a greater risk of having a person die from lack of food,” Doria says. “It is not the time for bureaucracy. It is time to get the resource into the hands of those in need, to save lives.”

Brazil,,https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-amazons-indigenous-tribes-brace-for-coronavirus/a-53042209,Brazil: Amazon's indigenous tribes brace for coronavirus,"The funeral of an 87-year-old indigenous woman of the Borari ethnicity mobilized an entire neighborhood on March 20. Hundreds of people showed up to pay their respects to the victim in Santarem, a city in Brazil's Amazon region. Despite the loss the atmosphere was festive, with attendees performing a local carimbó dance.

Ten days later, the local government announced a delayed diagnosis detailing the cause of the woman's death: a coronavirus infection.

""Santarem could turn into a major epicenter for COVID-19 in the interior of the Amazon,"" said neurosurgeon Erik Jennings. The hospital where he works, Hospital Regional do Baixo Amazonas (HRBA), is already caring for two patients who went to the ceremony. Both have severe symptoms, and one is a confirmed COVID-19 case.

Indigenous patients could overload city hospitals

Santarem is the region's commercial hub, and it welcomes about 300 million tourists per year. And the city is the only specialized treatment option for 1.1 million people in western Para state, a region with a high concentration of indigenous territories.

""We haven't equipped the villages with the minimum technological or human resources to solve things in these communities,"" said Jennings. ""The structure for the indigenous health system was based on a model that doesn't even work for white people during a pandemic.""

There were four confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 3. HRBA only has 20 hospital beds for adults in the intensive care unit and the municipal hospital has seven, meaning Santarem's hospital system could soon be overloaded. That wouldn't only compromise the hospitals' response to the coronavirus outbreak, but also to regular health services.

Jennings splits his time between the surgical center at the HRBA and a small hospital inside the indigenous territory Zoe, an isolated Amazon community. He first started working in the village as a volunteer 20 years ago, later joining the Health Ministry's Secretariat for Indigenous Health.

Since 2007, the hospital has been conducting complex surgeries and exams that respect the community's worldviews and customs. The pioneering initiative became a point of reference for the United Nations and the Health Ministry when they drew up a list of recommendations to help communities that are isolated or have only recently been contacted.

The objective of the initiative was to decentralize the hospitals' specialized services in big cities. The current system forces patients to travel, raising the risk of infection for communities that haven't already been exposed to certain diseases and could be decimated by a simple flu.

""Indigenous people who have to leave their villages to be treated will be exposed on the plane, in the ambulance and then in the hospital where people who don't have COVID-19 will be infected,"" said Jennings.

Doctors are potential transmitters

Not only do indigenous patients have to be moved to hospitals, but medical professionals are also forced to travel to the villages. The first confirmed COVID-19 case among indigenous communities in Brazil was actually an indigenous health official in Amazon state. She and 26 other people were being monitored after they had had contact with a local doctor who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning from a vacation.

In remote areas of the Amazon, where health teams tend to spend 15 days in the villages, this period has been extended to 30 days. Health care workers then have to isolate in the closest municipality for a fortnight, to reduce the risks caused by traveling. But it remains unclear who will pay for the professionals' accommodation in cities where they don't reside.

""The teams are very confused. Some professionals are paying for masks out of their own pockets because there's a lack of personal protective equipment. Others are scared of being asymptomatic and bringing the virus to the villages,"" said Marina Corradi, who monitors 16 supervisors of the program Mais Medicos (More Doctors) in northern states.

On Thursday, the Secretariat of Indigenous Health announced it would distribute rapid testing kits to detect COVID-19 among teams that visit the villages. It also announced that it would buy supplies and more protective gear, to ensure health professionals don't take the virus to communities they are treating.

Meanwhile, the Health Ministry has said the 500,000 rapid tests that have been distributed across Brazil have a 75% chance of error when they test negative for the new coronavirus.

Isolated tribes most vulnerable

At increased risk are communities that live in complete isolation. Specialists have warned that these ethnicities might be entirely wiped out in a genocide if the virus reaches them, an event that has occurred throughout Brazilian history.

In late March, federal prosecutors asked police to investigate a report made by indigenous leaders that said American missionary Andrew Tonkin was preparing an expedition to indigenous territories in Javari Valley. The move would go against the no-contact policy for isolated communities enshrined in the Brazilian constitution.

Last October, Brazil's agency for indigenous affairs, Funai, discharged Bruno Pereira, who coordinated the department for isolated communities. He had previously led the biggest expedition to an isolated tribe in the past 20 years, a rare project meant to prevent potential conflict between groups.

Read more: Brazil's indigenous fight back against Bolsonaro's attacks on Amazon

Funai replaced Periera with former evangelical missionary Ricardo Lopes Dias, a decision that caused a furor among activists. Many saw this appointment as an attempt to spread Christianity among indigenous communities.

""Despite its name — National Indigenous Foundation — Funai has abandoned its main objective of protecting and monitoring Brazil's indigenous territories with the current government. It's not a trustworthy agency for us,"" said Nara Bare from the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin.

As of Friday, there have been 22 suspected cases among indigenous people and 19 dismissed cases. There is one confirmed case in Amazon state.

The death of the 87-year-old indigenous woman in Santarem is not included in these numbers. The local secretariat said it was only counting the cases of indigenous people who live in remote villages. Those who live in cities are treated by the public health system.

Pandemic overshadows chronic problems

As Brazilians try to adapt to social distancing measures to slow down the spread of the virus, criminal groups have intensified their activities in indigenous territories.

Illegal mining has increased in the Amazon during the pandemic. And just last week, indigenous leader Zezico Guajajara was shot dead in Arariboia, a region of interest to loggers. The indigenous territory registered a similar crime with another leader last November.

""The criminal networks will notice the risk of being held accountable is decreasing, and we will definitely see criminal activity intensify in and around indigenous territories,"" said Danicley Aguilar, of Greenpeace's Amazon campaign. Aguilar wants to shed light on the decision of Brazil's Environment Institute to pare back its efforts to fight environmental crimes during the pandemic, which comes amid a deficit of 2,000 civil servants and other budget cuts.

Nigeria,,https://qz.com/africa/1824401/coronavirus-nigerias-cdc-has-conducted-only-153-tests/,The troubling data point behind Nigeria’s low number of coronavirus cases,"Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, has a case count of fewer than 50 coronavirus cases. But what’s become increasingly clear is that low number is not because the country has been lucky or particularly effective with preventing the spread of the disease—it’s more likely because local authorities are simply not testing enough people.

The latest available report by Nigeria’s Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) shows the country had tested only 152 people as of Mar. 22. That’s compared with South Africa which has conducted over 15,500 tests so far despite recording its index case a week later than Nigeria.

For its part, the NCDC has adopted a strategy of limiting tests to only people already showing symptoms of the disease or have come in contact with confirmed cases. It’s similar to approaches adopted in the United States and the United Kingdom but in comparison to those countries, Nigeria’s test numbers are far lower. The UK had tested over 78,000 people as of Mar. 22.

The slow pace of Nigeria’s tests is largely down to a lack of capacity. While it can conduct tests locally, Nigeria lacks the manpower or capacity to do so on a very large scale. Indeed, very few countries do: despite ramping up testing in recent days, the UK remains short of its 10,000 tests per day target. The danger however is that, unlike the UK, Nigeria’s public health infrastructure is starkly short on critical medical equipment and facilities to deal with a full-blown outbreak: there are reportedly fewer than 500 ventilators across the entire country.

Beyond low testing figures, there are also questions over Nigeria’s handling of the outbreak since confirming its index case at the end of February. Despite evidence that early confirmed cases comprised mainly of foreign travelers and Nigerians returning from high-risk countries, the Nigerian government did not move to limit incoming international flights until Mar. 23 following widespread calls from civic society groups. Several other African countries had adopted stiffer measures on international flights a week earlier to mitigate the risk of importing the virus.

While quarantine is mandatory in countries like Kenya, Ghana and Uganda for nationals and residents coming from high-risk countries, it has largely remained an advisory measure in Nigeria. As a result, health officials are scrambling for contact tracing after travelers on flights that arrived the country, in some cases as far back as ten days ago, test positive. It’s a task made more difficult by the reality that, without functioning databases for contact details, the government will largely rely on public service announcements to find possible contacts. Nigeria’s minister of health has already suggested it’s likely that infected persons are currently in hiding.

The seeming laxity of Nigeria’s quarantine measures have also been felt at the heart of Nigeria’s seat of power: Abba Kyari, president Muhammadu Buhari’s powerful chief of staff, has tested positive for coronavirus. His infection now raises questions about the status of top government officials as Kyari has attended several high-level government meetings since returning from Germany on Mar. 14 without self-isolating as advised.

Nigeria,,https://www.itnewsafrica.com/2020/04/covid-19-news-tech-companies-work-to-solve-the-ventilator-shortage-in-nigeria/,COVID-19 News: Tech Companies Work to Solve the Ventilator Shortage in Nigeria,"Last week, LifeBank announced via Instagram that it was building a national register of ventilators, respirators and ICU beds in Nigeria – reports Tech Cabal.

LifeBank founder, Temie Giwa-Tubosun says that they had found 126 units, possibly comprising all three equipment categories as the company had reached 200 hospitals across the country.

Now, two days after reaching 500 of 700 contacted hospitals, LifeBank has been able to register the availability of 244 units of equipment owned by the private sector – from this, it is confirmed that Nigeria has just under 100 ventilators that have been confirmed available in private-owned health facilities.

The majority of these ventilators are concentrated in Lagos, while the rest can be found in Abuja, Ogun, Delta, Rivers, and the Enugu states.





These statistics bode a dangerous hypothetical if COVID-19 runs out of control across the countries 36 states and 200-million citizens.

Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Nigeria have taken a large leap since the first case, diagnosed on 27 February. In 11 days, the second case was diagnosed. Now, the country is reporting 174 cases as of 1 April.

Dr. Ola Brown, of Flying Doctors Nigeria – an air ambulance and medical emergency logistics service, said – as of 22 cases only – that the country would need 56,320 ICU beds with ventilators in the next 30 days if drastic measures were not put in place to stall the spread of the virus.

Since then, President Muhammadu Buhari has initiated a 14-day lockdown, but numbers continue to rise.

Taking into account these statistics, the horizon looks grim indeed for Africa’s most populous country. Luckily, a few technology companies have sprung to the government’s aid.

One of these companies is Africa Business Angel Network, which is in the process of manufacturing more ventilators from a prototype model it had received through the possible aid of the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI).

Another, local auto manufacturer, Innosan Motors, says that it is ready to begin the manufacture of ventilators and other medical equipment for the country.

“There are other people saying they want to import. I, personally, believe if we’ve got the capacity, the one we can do ourselves will pay us in the long term,” says Tomi Davies, president of Africa Business Angel Network.

Around the world, different tech companies are working to solve ventilator shortages – these range from UK-based vacuum cleaner manufacturer CoVent – which is making 15,000 pieces to support the NHS. In the US, MIT has come up with a cheap, open-source ventilator called E-Vent, and is currently expecting regulatory approval to make specifications and instructions for public manufacture.

Even car manufacturers like Ford, Ferrari and Fiat have begun adapting their factories to produce ventilators in Australia and Italy respectively.

Nigeria’s health minister says that “…probably just 4% or less of the cases that you get requires a ventilator”, and with 174 cases, 4% may not seem like a lot. As the number climbs though, Nigeria’s tiny amount of available ventilators will soon run out without new sources.

Tech Cabal asks whether or not the country will be fully prepared for the coming onslaught if the curve is not flattened.

At midday on March 17, a week after the World Health Organisation declared the novel coronavirus a pandemic and 20 days after Nigeria reported its index case, Chikwe Ihekweazu — a consultant epidemiologist now leading Nigeria’s war against the spread of COVID-19 — called a meeting of top medical experts to appraise the country’s preparedness.

Mr Ihekweazu’s agency, the National Centre for Disease Control, was going to need a great deal of assistance in a very short period of time. As cases of coronavirus began to rise in Lagos, apprehension flared across the country of almost 200 million.

Of immediate concern was Nigeria’s decrepit health infrastructure, which has been so bad that even the president could not trust it to treat an ear infection.

During an appraisal of Nigeria’s readiness, the meeting heard that Nigeria had an estimated 350 intensive care units, according to officials present. Experts estimated Nigeria’s hospitals with Intensive Care Units (ICU) infrastructure at 71, with each having between one to 20 beds.

“The total number of ICU beds in the country was put at 350,” a source present at the meeting told PREMIUM TIMES, saying the meeting was held in “top secret” to avoid aggravating Nigerians about insufficient treatment mechanisms available in the country.

“Mr Ihekweazu and the rest of us present at the meeting swallowed a bitter pill,” the official said. “The situation was so helpless that the only thing we could do is to pray that Nigeria’s cases do not rise to the level we have seen in other countries.”

At the time the meeting held, Nigeria had eight confirmed cases out of 53 people tested, officials said. But as of March 30, 111 cases have been reported with one person confirmed dead from the virus. However, officials said Nigeria had enough personal protective equipment (PPEs) to last for 30 days.

Now, medical experts at the NCDC told PREMIUM TIMES they feared a time when doctors across the country would be faced with a situation where they would need to decide whose lives should be prioritised for the few available ventilators.

The 71 facilities that NCDC experts found are ICU-equipped contain both public and private hospitals across Nigeria, officials said.

For weeks, President Muhammadu Buhari declined to address Nigerians on the crisis, isolating himself from other leaders who have been at the frontline of containing the virus around the world.

When he eventually addressed the country in a pre-recorded speech on March 29, he did not mention ICUs or ventilators throughout his 20-minute speech. Instead, the president only announced a lockdown of Lagos, Ogun and Abuja for 14 days — and even that decision has been questioned by legal experts as unconstitutional.

PREMIUM TIMES obtained the information as senior administration officials, including health minister Osagie Ehanire and Mr Ihekweazu himself, have been avoiding questions around the country’s available ICU capacity.

Throughout last week, Messrs Ihekweazu and Enihare, as well as health ministry spokesperson, Enefaa Bob-Manuel, all declined PREMIUM TIMES’ request for comment on the briefing.

Popular demand

As the fight to contain COVID-19 becomes increasingly intense, countries across the world are racing to expand their ICUs in anticipation of many people who are likely to fall critically ill and overwhelm existing health capacity.

COVID-19, a highly infectious disease, has been adjudged by medical experts as potentially deadly for people with respiratory and other underlying health conditions.

Demand has risen worldwide for the supply of ventilators, a computerised device that pumps air in and out of the lungs. It has long been a crucial component of an ICU.

President Donald Trump spent last week urging U.S. manufacturers to ramp up production of ventilators, with the country tapping into its strategic reserve to cater for the sick in New York, Los Angeles and other densely-populated American cities.

On Friday, after General Motors announced it might not be able to produce more than 8,000 ventilators between now and April ending, the president invoked defence production laws to compel the major manufacturer to produce thousands more for Americans.

Mr Trump estimated that the U.S. may need additional 100,000 ventilators in about 100 days.

He had previously maintained his reluctance to use his defence production powers, and his breakaway underscores how crucial ventilators are in protecting lives amidst the pandemic.

Across Europe, demand for ventilators has skyrocketed, with existing tens of thousands of ventilators being deemed insufficient to address growing cases. The situation has prompted some countries to ban exportation of the critical resource in a bid to preserve their own population.

‘Hopeless situation’

As of March 30, Nigeria has confirmed only 111 coronavirus infections amongst its nearly 200 million people, a far cry from the thousands of cases recorded in the U.S. and European countries where ventilators have become a highly prized commodity.

However, analysts believe the few cases are due to insufficient testing. While other countries are testing thousands per day, Nigeria has tested less than 500 people so far. On Friday, Mr Ihekweazu admitted during an appearance on Arise TV that the country lacks sufficient kits to ramp up testing of citizens.

The situation has seen the NCDC carry out tests for political, business and entertainment elite across the country, even when they have not shown symptoms. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are asked to shelter-in-place until they show serious symptoms.

But, looking at countries with a superior health infrastructure, including thousands of ICUs and ventilators, scrambling to cope with coronavirus cases in their jurisdictions, experts in Nigeria are worried of dire days ahead.

“Let us be realistic here: Nigerians should expect tough times ahead, and that is even downplaying the severity of what we are likely to face,” Shuaib Musa, a medical doctor in Kaduna, told PREMIUM TIMES.

Mr Musa said even the 350 ICU beds that the NCDC estimated for Nigeria would have only a few left that are vacant.

“If you have up to 10 or 20 ICU beds that are not currently occupied by critically ill patients suffering from other health conditions other than COVID-19, then the country is even lucky,” the medical expert said.

Mr Musa said in the entire Kaduna State, only the 44 Reference Hospital and the Nigerian Air Force Base have a few functional ICU beds, which he strongly doubted would be made available to non-military citizens.

“From my findings as a medical doctor in this state, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital either has no functional ICU beds or barely functional ones,” Mr Musa said.

Mr Musa said when serious testing commences, Nigeria would likely record thousands of COVID-19 cases and demand for ventilators would rise.

“We cannot treat them with our existing infrastructure and the money released by the president the other day is only a drop in the bucket,” the doctor said.

Nneka Chukwumah, a medical expert at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, told PREMIUM TIMES the outbreak could overwhelm Nigerian hospitals in the coming weeks.

“The hospitals we had before the outbreak were poorly equipped,” Ms Chukwumah said. “But considering what other countries have been going through, we would simply say Nigerian hospitals would not be able to cope.”

Ms Chukwumah, a dental consultant, said Nigerians are being given a false sense of assumption that the infections are still below 100 in Nigeria.

“They have not been testing,” she said. “The numbers would have been far higher, otherwise.”

She said the prevailing approach could cast Nigeria as an unserious country.

“By now, all hospitals should have had the rapid test kits at least,” she said. “This would allow doctors to test on the spot once a case is suspected.”

She said in Edo State, some COVID-19 carriers are still entering public buses to go and seek testing and treatment.

“They send people to go to Irua to test if they think they might have contracted the virus, now they would enter public transport and before they get to Irua additional people have been exposed,” she said.

Experts at the NCDC meeting estimated Nigeria’s 350 ICU beds meant that one in 285,000 people would have access to critical treatment, using medical practice of calculating half of the population.

Last week, The Punch gathered from across the country that less than 500 ventilators are available, with many hospitals having only a few functional ones.

Latest findings by PREMIUM TIMES showed that only 20 ICU beds are available at National Hospital Abuja, while the University of Benin Teaching Hospital has between six and eight beds.

‘Grossly inadequate’

As of March 27, Mr Buhari has only released about N15 billion ($40 million) for Nigeria’s fight against COVID-19. But in a system that has been moribund for decades, the money is seen by experts as grossly inadequate.

“Without sugarcoating the situation, the response from the president has been grossly inadequate,” Folashade Adeyemi, an economist, told PREMIUM TIMES. “We are looking at a situation far more critical than we have ever been in.”

Ms Adeyemi said even though the prices of crude had dwindled recently, making revenues difficult for government, COVID-19 should take priority over other government expenditure for now.

“Across the world, you have seen governments announcing huge stimulus for their citizens, and that is because they realise what damage the virus could cause in the long run,” she added.

Mr Buhari’s N15 billion would go to Lagos and the NCDC, but it failed to address critical but expensive medical supplies that may be required.

A few churches and businesses have been making donations towards the country’s health. Earlier this week, Herbert Wigwe and a few other top bankers and business executives donated N1 billion each, to help Nigeria combat the crisis.

Innoson Motors, Nigeria’s indigenous car manufacturer, recently told PREMIUM TIMES it was ready to convert its production lines to making ventilators as part of Nigeria’s response to the crisis. As of Saturday afternoon, no concrete plans had been put in place, even though the company told PREMIUM TIMES representatives of federal and state governments had reached out days ago.

“Nigeria does not have a defence production law to implement in the manner we saw with President Trump,” Ms Adeyemi said. “But there are many steps that could be taken to get the company to start producing as soon as possible.”",,"['8,000 ventilators', '100,000 ventilators', '500 ventilators']","['20 ICU beds', '350 ICU beds']",

Bangladesh,,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/in-bangladesh-covid-19-could-cause-a-humanitarian-crisis/,Why Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to the coronavirus,"Only 15% of Bangladeshi workers earn more than $6 a day.

The economic shutdown sparked by COVID-19 threatens millions of livelihoods in the country imminently.

But there are reasons for optimism, too - not least the country's resilience.

Dhaka’s streets are eerily empty. When 10 million rickshaw drivers, day labourers, factory workers, maids and others raced to get home before the start of the shutdown - announced by the government on 26 March - the city became unnaturally quiet.

Dhaka is usually full of the sounds of interaction, energy, and a growing economy. These are the sounds of people earning money; people who were able to get by financially.

Where are they now? What will they eat? How long can a rickshaw puller like Shumi in Rajshahi, whose family of five subsists on what she can bring home at the end of the day, after she has paid a 350 taka ($4.10) guarantee to the rickshaw owner?

According to World Bank data, only 15% of Bangladesh’s population makes more than 500 taka ($5.90) a day. They can meet their daily expenses, send their children to school, and hope that they reserve enough for an emergency health crisis. Most villagers depend on remittances from the cities or abroad. But because this is a global crisis, people everywhere are out of work. Income has stopped.

How long can they last?

The US government is now encouraging physical distancing until the end of April. Approximately 75% of US workers have access to paid sick leave, and close to 90% have health insurance. Almost one-third of people could work effectively from home. And yet we still see that, despite all of these forms of social support and benefits, many people are struggling financially with the consequences of COVID-19 policies.

In Bangladesh - where over 90% of workers are in the informal sector, health insurance is a luxury, and most homes don’t have any sort of internet connectivity - how much more devastating would these policies be here? How many workers making 500 taka a day can work from home?

For Bangladesh, let’s admit that COVID-19 is a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension. If large-scale physical distancing is required, we must find ways to mitigate the economic shock that will bring the majority of the country into food insecurity within weeks. The urban poor, who live off their daily wages, will have to skip meals. Let’s find ways to keep people safe that also protect their livelihoods. If they absolutely must stay home, we will need to provide food or emergency cash transfers. Assuming that mobile money providers are able to keep their agents active during this time, we have a financial system that goes deep into the villages and could deliver money to almost every household.

While there are important lessons to be learned from China, South Korea, Italy and other countries who are deeper into their COVID-19 response than we are, we should also question how much of their policies could be imported here. China’s health expenditure per capita is 10 times that of Bangladesh; Italy’s is eight times higher than China’s.

It doesn’t stop there. People who are staying at home will connect to the world through their smartphones - buying groceries, sending money to loved ones or video chatting with friends to stay mentally positive. The data from smartphones - location information in particular - has proven invaluable in contact tracing. In South Korea, a website that tracks the locations of newly identified cases enables people to see if they have been exposed at the mall or the movies, and to seek testing. Today in China, people get a red, green or yellow message on their phone that lets them know whether they should prepare to leave their home and go to work, based on the latest COVID surveillance data. Contrast this with Bangladesh, where many people struggle to understand text messages, and a recent phone-based COVID-19 survey led to widespread confusion.

We can seek inspiration from other countries' models, but we should also recognize that many mitigation strategies may be out of our reach. We should also realise - soberingly - that our public healthcare system is already overburdened and that the curve, as is, very skewed and not flattened. According to World Bank data, Bangaldesh has 8 hospital beds for every 10,000 people; by way of comparison, the US has 29 beds per 10,000 people while China has 42.

It gets worse. The country's entire public health system has 432 ICU beds, only 110 of which are outside the capital Dhaka. The private healthcare sector adds another 737 - and this is for a population of 170 million. Italy has 4.1 doctors on average per 1,000 people whereas Bangladesh has 0.5; that is based on official numbers, and a significant chunk of these doctors are either abroad or not practicing. At Dhaka’s medical college and hospital, the largest government medical facility in the country, over 500 patients seek critical care monthly, and more than 400 are turned away due to lack of capacity.

We need to think hard about an appropriate public response in a place as densely populated as Bangladesh, where most families’ ability to eat depends on daily wages and 87% of employment is generated by the informal sector. The average household in Bangladesh has more than five members, and usually includes three generations. Families share one latrine and more than 80% of households living in slums share a water source with five or more other households. There is no way to separate the old and the young; in other words, to separate the productive adults from those whose age makes them more vulnerable to serious illness and death. To practice the social distancing norms that most Western countries have relied on to reduce transmission is proving to be culturally completely impossible here. How do you stock up on 30-day supplies when you can only buy a few days’ worth of food? What will you do after that food runs out if your income has been cut off?

While I am worried, I also have endless faith in Bangladesh’s ability to rise in a moment of crisis. Even when outsiders see us as a basket case, we see an innovative path forward. When global health experts said that Bengali mothers couldn’t make oral rehydration solution at home and we’d have to import packets of premade solution, which were heavy and difficult to transport to rural villages given the communications infrastructure in the 1980s, we taught families how to prepare 'lobon-gur' (a mixture of local salt and unrefined sugar) and child mortality plunged. When people in villages were dying of tuberculosis because the hospitals were too far away, we found ways to bring testing and treatment to the community level.

COVID-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world’s best networks of community health workers, a rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience.",,,['432 ICU beds'],

Bangladesh has a health crisis in the making. The lack of preparation in the United States and Europe that has spawned the ongoing crisis there still exceeds the preparedness of developing countries such as Bangladesh, which will have to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with limited financial resources and a legacy of poor healthcare infrastructure, especially for the urban poor. Already one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh also has thousands of stateless Rohingya housed in sprawling refugee camps in the southeastern region of the country, in conditions prime for rapid spread. Given its proximity to China and a large migrant population living in severely affected countries such as Italy, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should have taken preventative measures when the Chinese government first shared news of the deadly virus. Unfortunately, precious time was squandered.

After the first reported death in Bangladesh from COVID-19, there was a mass religious gathering in the southern part of the country attended by tens of thousands of people. Such events have been discouraged by authorities but communications need to be clearer and more forceful to be effective. Currently there is a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, during which the army is enforcing social distancing across the nation. There are several potential policies the Bangladeshi government can use in its response strategy to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic’s health and economic impact on Bangladesh.

The current situation

The Bangladeshi research institute spearheading the fight to test and detect coronavirus is the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), a body under the Ministry of Health. The IEDCR has recommended that citizens avoid mass public gatherings. Yet, for the March 17 birth centenary of the country’s founder, Sheikh Mijibur Rahman, the government arranged two major public events in Dhaka. These events were supposedly more scaled down from their original intended size, but even so they was still packed with thousands of celebrants, live music, and fireworks.

Unlike in neighboring Nepal where the army set up a quarantine facility in Kathmandu as per the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation upon the first positive COVID-19 test, the handling of quarantine measures in Bangladesh was inadequate. When the first batch of mass returnees arrived from China in February, they were all quarantined at the Ashkana Hajj Camp in Dhaka. The returnees complained about subpar conditions, including poor hygienic conditions and being crammed in small spaces. However, the authorities ignored the situation and the health risks it posed to those in quarantine. Subsequently, in mid-March when the second batch of foreign returnees—over a hundred and forty Bangladeshis evacuated from Italy—arrived, confusion ensued when they were taken to the same inadequate quarantine spot. These returnees protested and were ultimately allowed to leave with the promise of “home quarantine.”

On March 18, tens of thousands of people gathered in Raipur in the southern district of Lakshmipur to pray “healing verses” from the Quran. This event was organized by an influential local religious leader who urged people to join this event, promising a way to be “free from the coronavirus.” The same week, school holidays were announced to support the quarantine, but domestic tourist destinations such as the coastal areas of Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar were all bustling with people and activity. On March 20, the Islamic Foundation allowed congregational prayers to go on albeit for a shortened length.

Such contradiction in policy guidance and lack-luster enforcement has wasted precious time for the government to shore up its limited public health system and to implement best practices for maximizing social distancing and minimizing community transmission of the novel coronavirus. The impact on Bangladesh’s economy due to these missteps is likely to be significant.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that export industries will suffer and the country will lose 1.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) growth due to the pandemic. The ready-made garments sector which accounts for more than 80 percent of Bangladesh’s manufacturing income has already suffered a loss of $3 billion as major export destinations such as the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union are cancelling orders. In addition, foreign remittances representing over 5 percent of GDP (close to $17 billion in fiscal year 2019) will be affected as half a million migrant workers have returned home since the outbreak. The majority of these migrant workers were based in Middle Eastern countries which have been hit by declining oil prices. Furthermore, daily wage laborers, such as rickshaw-pullers, are the hardest hit as the closure of schools and colleges have led to lower demand for their services. For these workers—who survive hand to mouth daily—the consequences of quarantines and lockdowns, however medically necessary, are dire without robust government provision of food and supplementary income.

Some encouraging news

Bangladesh’s government is hardly alone in not tackling the pandemic early enough. Fortunately, after a slow start, the government has begun to show signs of urgency. Following the mass religious gathering in southern Bangladesh, the government started enforcing social distancing measures. Local administrations have been told to punish violators of the home-quarantine rules in line with Section 269 of the Penal Code. Additionally, an emergency lockdown has been imposed in the sub-district of Shibchar since March 19 where many returnees from Italy are based. The general secretary of the ruling party Awami League, Obaidul Quader, said that in the future there may be a possibility of further lockdowns in other areas. Most recently, the government declared a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, wherein all government and private offices have been closed, and with the army mobilized to enforce social distancing across the nation. Almost all international flights have been suspended until April 7 and the country’s March 26 Independence Day celebrations were subdued.

The government encouraged low-income people to return to their villages where they would be provided with government aid or to take refuge in Bhashanchar, an island in the Bay of Bengal originally built to house Rohingya refugees. On March 20, the government authorized the Bangladesh Army to run two quarantine centers in Dhaka. One quarantine facility remains the same Ashkona Hajj Camp that has proved inadequate before. The other is a new one at Rajuk Apartment Project near Diyabari in Uttara.

In the medical arena, there has been progress as well. Isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients have been set up in district-level hospitals across the country. Students and teachers of the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Dhaka have started making low-cost hand sanitizers due to market shortages in the wake of coronavirus fears. And, Gonoshasthaya Kendra, a public health center in Dhaka, received approval from the country’s Directorate of Drug Administration (DGDA) to mass-produce COVID-19 detection kits, each costing around $3.

Recommendations for tackling the situation

Policymakers in Bangladesh should gear up in anticipation of a deterioration of the situation. While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has promised a $6.5 billion package to address the immediate needs of developing member countries (DMCs), and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged $10 million toward a special emergency fund to set up a rapid response team for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh will have to face this battle largely on its own. Over the past ten days, the South Asia Center has consulted broadly with public health professionals and social scientists who study Bangladesh. Those conversations lead us to offer the following healthcare, social, and economic recommendations:

Health Care

Support initiatives to increase the local production of medical gloves, masks, and other medical kits for health care practitioners who, as the front line defenders, are the most vulnerable. According to Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque, as of now, Bangladesh has adequate testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE), numbering around two hundred thousand units. On March 26, a large consignment of emergency medical supplies provided by the Chinese government arrived. This shipment included 10,000 testing reagents, 15,000 surgical masks, 10,000 medical protective equipment, and 1,000 infrared thermometers. But, as the grim lessons from other countries make clear, in the case of a mass outbreak, even more PPE will be required and more testing needs to be done.

COVID-19 testing facilities should be made available across both public and private medical centers with immediate effect. Once locally produced full-scale standardized and accurate kits are available, testing capabilities should be distributed to other locations in Dhaka and across the country. Bangladesh should commit to mass testing on about one percent of its population to identify community spread of COVID-19. As of March 29, Bangladesh’s official COVID-19 tracker confirms forty-eight cases and five deaths. A press conference that day stated that 1,185 tests have been conducted thus far. This number is much lower in comparison to India and Pakistan, who as of March 29, have tested 27,688 and 14,336 cases respectively.

Implement awareness campaigns for the general public. Unless an individual is over sixty-five and/or has pre-existing health conditions, symptoms should be followed by a six to seven-day quarantine period and individuals should not go to health care facilities. If an individual’s health condition continues to deteriorate, they should then go for COVID-19 testing.

Emotional and mental health services, as well as financial support, should be provided for health workers. The medical community of the nation at this point are severely at high risk and are fearful.

Social

The Ministry of Religious Affairs should endorse the fatwa of the Council of Senior Scholars at Al-Azhar, one of the Muslim world’s top Islamic institutions, where it is permitted under Sharia Law to suspend congregational prayers to counter the spread of the virus. Many Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East including Saudi Arabia have banned gatherings such as in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.

Restaurants and public locations should remain closed after April 4 for a period of at least another ten days, and citizens should be prepared for even longer disruptions of daily life. There must be tougher self-quarantine norms—and if needed lockdown measures—in certain areas of the country with higher concentrations of Bangladeshi expatriates. Sri Lanka had instituted a stay-at-home curfew in eight districts of the country, where violation of this measure has led to the arrest of over 1,600 people. Now that the army has been summoned in Bangladesh, certain districts across the country can be asked to impose curfew-like restrictions, with violations leading to strict punishment and fines.

The government must utilize television, radio, and social media to counter the spread of fraudulent treatment methods through disinformation channels, and to raise appropriate awareness of COVID-19’s dangers for even otherwise healthy victims.

Village community leaders such as Imams and village elders should be involved in spreading information on countering COVID-19. Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government officials have a list of such leaders and can centrally coordinate their response.

Private universities should be mobilized to provide premises for quarantine facilities and temporary hospitals, given that many of them have campuses located right outside Dhaka. Similar initiatives have been taken by higher educational institutions in the United States.

Economic

To protect daily wage laborers who have not left Dhaka to return to their hometowns, tougher lockdown measures accompanied by supportive humanitarian measures should be implemented in slum areas where daily wage workers are concentrated. As in the Rohingya camps, daily wage laborers should be provided with rations for two weeks so that they can observe social distancing measures without risk of starvation or malnutrition. Such a policy could build on the precedent by the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, which will provide free rations to the poor until September. Additionally, as the month of Ramadan is approaching, zakat funds should be collected by both the government and NGOs for this purpose

The government must provide the necessary financing to allow Gonoshasthaya Kendra and other health care organizations to produce their COVID-19 testing kits at requisite volumes and support distributional channels to allow medical facilities around the country to access these kits.

The government must help catalyze the funding required to enable the local production of hand sanitizers and PPEs, which are being made by university students and small tech companies. This will disincentivize counterfeiting and fraud.

Over the next six months, the government must ensure that strategies suggested by the ADB and other international organizations are implemented without delay to minimize the inevitable economic slowdown that will follow even a successful fight against the novel coronavirus.

The global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a once-in-a-generation pathogen that has proven capable of bringing the health systems of the richest countries of the world to their knees. The damage that will be wrought on developing country populations if their governments delay implementation of aggressive countermeasures is unimaginable. Living in densely populated areas with large sections of society reliant on daily wages to make ends meet—and served by public health systems that have been deprived of investment for decades—Bangladeshi citizens are among the world’s most vulnerable to the unchecked spread of this disease. But the situation is not hopeless, and Dhaka must utilize every tool in its arsenal to serve its citizens. The policy checklist presented above is a good place to start.

Bangladesh,04-06-2020 18:23,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-ranks-among-worlds-worst-in-coronavirus-testing-rate-together-with-ethiopia,"Indonesia ranks among world's worst in coronavirus testing rate, together with Ethiopia, Bangladesh","JAKARTA - Only 36 in every million people are being tested for the coronavirus in Indonesia, making it the fourth worst in testing rate among countries with a 50 million population or above, pandemic data site Worldometer has revealed.

The world's fourth-most populous country of 270 million performed better than only Ethiopia, Nigeria and Bangladesh, according to the site, which has introduced a new feature showing testing rates relative to the respective country's population.

The three worst-preforming are Ethiopia, with 16 tests for every million people, Bangladesh (18), and Nigeria (19). In comparison, South Korea tests 8,996 for every million people, Singapore 6,666, and Malaysia 1,605.

Asked by The Straits Times on Monday (April 6) about Indonesia's very low rate, Mr Achmad Yurianto, a government spokesman for Covid-19 management, said: ""We don't test based on the size of population, but based on contact tracing of positive cases as well as based on the visits to health facilities by people with Covid-19 symptoms.""

He added that Indonesia is also doing rapid tests, but the number of such tests - and the number of any confirmation tests after this procedure - do not add to the Covid-19 national tallies.

He stressed that such rapid tests, which are not as reliable as the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, are used only to help with early ""screening"" of people who may have contracted the virus.

Any close contact who is tested negative using a rapid test kit must redo the procedure after a period of time, while anyone testing positive would have to be confirmed by a PCR test.

Rapid tests are antibody tests, which determines whether a person has developed immunity to the coronavirus. These tests, however, have a limited role in diagnosis, according to experts, as it takes the body four days or longer after infection to produce antibodies, which would be too late for the purpose of quick detection and contact tracing.

Indonesia's ranking among the likes of Ethiopia comes as a surprise as the South-east Asia's largest economy has a GDP that is at least three times larger than any of the three bottom-ranked countries. Indonesia’s GDP per capita, often used as an indicator of a country’s standard of living, is at least double.

Indonesia has a GDP of USD$1.1 trillion (S$ 1.58 trillion), while Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nigeria has a GDP of US$81 billion, US$250 billion, and US$375 billion, respectively.

Indonesia's health ministry has been widely criticised for red tape in bringing in test kits, as well as equipment to read the PCR test samples.

Recent media reports have also pointed out that the ministry's official Covid-19 death toll nationwide, currently at 209, is an understated figure contradicted by separate announcements by local governments in West Java and the Jakarta municipal government, which indicate a higher toll. This has raised questions about the health ministry's transparency and credibility in disclosing data, the local media has reported.

Jakarta, where about half of the national confirmed cases are from, issued a monthly figure on burials in the capital for March at 4,377, well above the monthly average of 2,745 burials last year and 2,774 burials the year before.

On April 2, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said 401 burials were conducted following the Covid-19 protocol. The national tally shows the fatality in Jakarta as only 99.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah is among currencies that have weakened sharply against the US dollar as the coronavirus crisis deepened. The rupiah fell 15 per cent year on year on April 6, while other currencies that have seen sharp falls in the same period include the Mexican peso, which dropped 26 per cent, and the Russian rouble, 19 per cent.

Some of these countries have spent a lot of their foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the currency markets. Experts, however, have argued that uncertainty and a lack of credibility pose the greatest threat to these countries' currency values, and improving transparency in their Covid-19 data and boosting testing rates would be the most effective measures to address their currency depreciation woes.",['16 tests'],,,

Bangladesh so far tested samples of only 2,419 suspects

Getting tested for coronavirus in Bangladesh has not been an easy task for many suspect cases as the health authorities kept it quite limited since the first infection was reported on March 8.

Amid much criticism from different quarters, the health authorities finally expanded its numbers for testing from Thursday afternoon.

In the last 24 hours till 12pm yesterday, a total of 203 samples were tested in Bangladesh.

Although health officials collected 523 samples over the 24 hours, only 203 of them were tested, and as of 2:30pm on Friday results were pending for the rest.

The daily testing rate remained below 100 per day till March 25, a day before the government imposed a shutdown to encourage people to stay at home to fight the spread of coronavirus.

The Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) widened the volume of testing from Thursday, a day after a meeting was held between Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, doctors, and health officials. The premier, at the meeting, suggested to collect samples from various areas across the country to get a clearer picture on Covid-19 situation in Bangladesh.

The move comes from DGHS at a time when thousands of panic-gripped people wait in queues outside the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), requesting them to test their samples, but the authorities continue to decline most of them, saying that no tests are required for people with only flu or cough like symptoms.

According to IEDCR, tests are conducted on suspects such as returned expatriates showing symptoms; persons exposed to someone who has already tested positive; symptomatic people aged over 60 having comorbidity; symptomatic people with any pre-existing condition; persons having atypical pneumonia; serious hospitalized patients with corona syndromes; professionals with symptoms who came into contact with different walks of people.

South Korea is the ideal example of how to slow down the spread of the virus – isolate people, and test them as much as possible. It tested over 325,000 people within a single month and isolated the infected.

On the other hand, Bangladesh so far tested samples of only 2,419 suspects. Among them, 61 people have been found infected with coronavirus, with six deaths confirmed by IEDCR.

5 more infected, no new deaths

Five more patients have tested positive for Covid-19 in Bangladesh in the last 24 hours after the government initiative led to the highest number of tests being conducted in a span of 24 hours on Friday.

No new deaths were reported across Bangladesh during the period.

Health Minister Zahid Maleque disclosed the information via an online press briefing on Friday.

In Bangladesh, a total of six people have died of Covid-19, a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus, while 26 people have so far recovered from the infection.

‘Continue providing medical care’

The health minister mentioned that several private hospitals and clinics have been closed down during this crisis and some doctors have taken a break from their private practice.

“Do not back away from providing medical care to those who need it,” he urged.

Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) Director-General Abul Kalam Azad said 513 new samples were tested in the last 24 hours—126 in IEDCR and 387 in other testing facilities.

However, Azad said he does not yet have the testing information of some 20 districts and the 513 tests that were done in the rest of the districts in the last 24 hours.

71,000 testing kits available

Prof Azad said DGHS has 71,000 testing kits in stock as they did not have to distribute more kits to the designated testing facilities for now.

“We will distribute those kits as needed and we are going to increase the number of tests,” he said.

There are nine testing facilities in Dhaka and five outside Dhaka that are functioning currently.

PPEs distributed

A total of 28 testing facilities will be set up in April across the country, the DGSH director-general said.

A total of 3,66,350 personal protective equipment (PPE) have been distributed to healthcare professionals across the country till now, and 64,410 more are currently in stock.

Azad said people are panicking over seasonal flu as the symptoms resemble Covid-19 symptoms and visiting hospitals when they can just take over the counter medicines and use home remedies to recover.

IEDCR hotline explodes with calls

DGHS DG said IEDCR staff are overwhelmed with calls as more people tend to call them instead of calling 16263 and 333.

“IEDCR has 19 phones and all of them remain busy as too many people call there. We recommend people with health issues other than Covid-19 symptoms to call 16263 and 333,” Azad said.

He also added that if the staff think anyone needs to call IEDCR numbers, they will redirect the call there.

In the last 24-hours, IEDCR hotline numbers, health call centre number 16263, and 333 received 65,984 phone calls.

During the same time frame, 547 people have been home quarantined, while 5 were quarantined in designated institutions.

16,453 quarantined

Currently, a total of 16,453 people are quarantined.

During the last 24-hours, 14 people have been taken to isolation units and 10 have been released; 82 people are in isolation right now.

So far, a total of 48,031 people have been released from quarantine, informed the DGHS director-general.

The fast spreading coronavirus, which was first reported in China's Wuhan, has infected more than 1,040,656 people and claimed more than 55,188 lives across the world to date, according to Worldometer.

Globally, about 222,240 infected people have recovered from Covid-19, a pandemic announced by the World Health Organization (WHO).",['513 tests'],,,"['3,66,350 personal protective equipment']"

Updated at 3:42 p.m. ET on 2020-04-06

Hospitals across Bangladesh have fewer than 1,500 ventilators, the health minister said Monday, after rights group Save The Children pointed to a severe nationwide shortage of the machines amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The number of ventilators in Bangladeshi hospitals or in the pipeline would average out to about one for nearly every 100,000 people, as the densely populated South Asian nation contends with a public health threat from COVID-19, the London-based humanitarian NGO said.

“We have a shortage of ventilators. These machines are costly and sophisticated,” Health Minister Zahid Maleque told BenarNews.

Bangladesh, a nation of about 165 million people, has “slightly more than 1,475 ventilators” at all of its government-run and private hospitals, he said.

“This is very hard to give an exact number for ventilators as some machines remain in operation and some remain out of order or under maintenance,” Maleque said. “In addition, we have ordered 300 ventilators from European manufacturers. These have been in the pipeline.”

According to the minister, not all patients afflicted with the coronavirus need to be hooked up to these devices, which help patients breathe.

“The elderly patients with severe respiratory problems need ventilators. Ordinary coronavirus patients do not need ventilators,” he said.

But Bangladeshi health experts contacted by BenarNews on Monday said these machines were essential for treating patients suffering from COVID-19, because the virus attacks people’s lungs.

“[V]entilators actually provide alternative support to the respiratory system of the COVID-19 patients. In most of the cases, ventilators are a must for treating COVID-19 patients,” said Dr. Md Nazrul Islam, a professor of virology at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), a state-run institution.

There is a shortage of ventilators nationwide, and not all intensive care units at hospitals are equipped with those machines, he said. The hospital associated with the university where he teaches is considered one of the best centers of medicine in Bangladesh, but it has only 30 ventilators, he said.

“We have to increase the number of ventilators as the number of patients continues to grow,” Islam said.

On Monday, Bangladeshi health authorities reported the single largest daily spike to date in confirmed COVID-19 cases, saying 35 new cases were detected, bringing the national total to 123. Three new fatalities from the virus were also recorded, bringing the official national death toll to 12.

Early in the day, Save The Children warned that hospitals in Bangladesh may not be able to cope under pressure from the pandemic as it eventually strains the country’s supply of ventilators.

“At present it is difficult for Bangladesh to meet the expected surge in demand for ventilators to help respond to the COVID-19 outbreak,” Shamim Jahan, the NGO’s deputy country director in Bangladesh, said in a news release issued by Save The Children.

“We are in this together – no single country can confront COVID-19 alone, even the richest and most powerful among us. It is therefore essential that world leaders – in particular the G20 countries – commit to a coordinated global plan under-pinned by debt relief. We also urge the Bangladesh government to engage the public and private sectors urgently to secure ventilators for COVID-19 patients,” Jahan said.

‘No ventilators in Cox’s Bazar’

The densely populated southeastern district of Cox’s Bazar – home to sprawling camps that house more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar – is particularly vulnerable to the viral outbreak, Save The Children said.

“The acute scarcity of ventilators in the district means lives will be lost when COVID-19 starts to spread more widely in the community,” The NGO said.

But in fact, according to Dr. Mahbubur Rahman, head of the district’s health office, “there are no ventilators in Cox’s Bazar.”

“We detected one coronavirus patient and referred the patient to Dhaka where she completely recovered,” he told BenarNews. “But we feel that Cox’s Bazar hospitals should have an adequate number of ventilators.”

Rahman said the victim was a Bangladeshi woman who had returned from Saudi Arabia. So far, no Rohingya have tested positive for COVID-19.

“But we have already requested that authorities allocate ventilators for Cox’s Bazar hospitals to meet an emergency,” he said.

Meanwhile, at the national level, help could be coming from Bangladeshi businesses assisted by a major international manufacturer of ventilators.

In a Facebook post on March 31, the state minister for information and communication technology said Medtronic, an Ireland-based company led by a Bangladeshi man, had released software source codes and hardware designs to Bangladesh’s government.

Minister Zunaid Ahmed Palak said local companies Walton, MyOne, Celltron, a2i Innovation Lab, MIST, Minister Electronics, Startup Bangladesh and iDEA were using that information to produce ventilators.

Worldwide more than 70,500 people have died and nearly 1.3 million have been infected from the coronavirus, according to the latest data compiled by disease experts at Johns Hopkins University in the United States.

“Without access to intensive care facilities in Cox’s Bazar, patients in critical condition may have to be transported to neighboring Chittagong district 150 kilometers [93.2 miles] away, further increasing the risk to them and others,"" said Athena Rayburn, the Rohingya Response Advocacy manager for Save The Children.

""Ventilators and people trained to operate them are urgently needed to protect the host communities and Rohingya refugees to avert a humanitarian disaster if we start to see community-level transmission of COVID-19. Children are at serious risk of contracting the virus, but also of being orphaned or neglected if family members become infected or die,” she said.",,"['1,500 ventilators', '1,475 ventilators', '30 ventilators', '300 ventilators']",,
Bangladesh,,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/in-bangladesh-covid-19-could-cause-a-humanitarian-crisis/,Why Bangladesh is especially vulnerable to the coronavirus,"Only 15% of Bangladeshi workers earn more than $6 a day.

The economic shutdown sparked by COVID-19 threatens millions of livelihoods in the country imminently.

But there are reasons for optimism, too - not least the country's resilience.

Dhaka’s streets are eerily empty. When 10 million rickshaw drivers, day labourers, factory workers, maids and others raced to get home before the start of the shutdown - announced by the government on 26 March - the city became unnaturally quiet.

Dhaka is usually full of the sounds of interaction, energy, and a growing economy. These are the sounds of people earning money; people who were able to get by financially.

Where are they now? What will they eat? How long can a rickshaw puller like Shumi in Rajshahi, whose family of five subsists on what she can bring home at the end of the day, after she has paid a 350 taka ($4.10) guarantee to the rickshaw owner?

According to World Bank data, only 15% of Bangladesh’s population makes more than 500 taka ($5.90) a day. They can meet their daily expenses, send their children to school, and hope that they reserve enough for an emergency health crisis. Most villagers depend on remittances from the cities or abroad. But because this is a global crisis, people everywhere are out of work. Income has stopped.

How long can they last?

The US government is now encouraging physical distancing until the end of April. Approximately 75% of US workers have access to paid sick leave, and close to 90% have health insurance. Almost one-third of people could work effectively from home. And yet we still see that, despite all of these forms of social support and benefits, many people are struggling financially with the consequences of COVID-19 policies.

In Bangladesh - where over 90% of workers are in the informal sector, health insurance is a luxury, and most homes don’t have any sort of internet connectivity - how much more devastating would these policies be here? How many workers making 500 taka a day can work from home?

For Bangladesh, let’s admit that COVID-19 is a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension. If large-scale physical distancing is required, we must find ways to mitigate the economic shock that will bring the majority of the country into food insecurity within weeks. The urban poor, who live off their daily wages, will have to skip meals. Let’s find ways to keep people safe that also protect their livelihoods. If they absolutely must stay home, we will need to provide food or emergency cash transfers. Assuming that mobile money providers are able to keep their agents active during this time, we have a financial system that goes deep into the villages and could deliver money to almost every household.

While there are important lessons to be learned from China, South Korea, Italy and other countries who are deeper into their COVID-19 response than we are, we should also question how much of their policies could be imported here. China’s health expenditure per capita is 10 times that of Bangladesh; Italy’s is eight times higher than China’s.

It doesn’t stop there. People who are staying at home will connect to the world through their smartphones - buying groceries, sending money to loved ones or video chatting with friends to stay mentally positive. The data from smartphones - location information in particular - has proven invaluable in contact tracing. In South Korea, a website that tracks the locations of newly identified cases enables people to see if they have been exposed at the mall or the movies, and to seek testing. Today in China, people get a red, green or yellow message on their phone that lets them know whether they should prepare to leave their home and go to work, based on the latest COVID surveillance data. Contrast this with Bangladesh, where many people struggle to understand text messages, and a recent phone-based COVID-19 survey led to widespread confusion.

We can seek inspiration from other countries' models, but we should also recognize that many mitigation strategies may be out of our reach. We should also realise - soberingly - that our public healthcare system is already overburdened and that the curve, as is, very skewed and not flattened. According to World Bank data, Bangaldesh has 8 hospital beds for every 10,000 people; by way of comparison, the US has 29 beds per 10,000 people while China has 42.

It gets worse. The country's entire public health system has 432 ICU beds, only 110 of which are outside the capital Dhaka. The private healthcare sector adds another 737 - and this is for a population of 170 million. Italy has 4.1 doctors on average per 1,000 people whereas Bangladesh has 0.5; that is based on official numbers, and a significant chunk of these doctors are either abroad or not practicing. At Dhaka’s medical college and hospital, the largest government medical facility in the country, over 500 patients seek critical care monthly, and more than 400 are turned away due to lack of capacity.

We need to think hard about an appropriate public response in a place as densely populated as Bangladesh, where most families’ ability to eat depends on daily wages and 87% of employment is generated by the informal sector. The average household in Bangladesh has more than five members, and usually includes three generations. Families share one latrine and more than 80% of households living in slums share a water source with five or more other households. There is no way to separate the old and the young; in other words, to separate the productive adults from those whose age makes them more vulnerable to serious illness and death. To practice the social distancing norms that most Western countries have relied on to reduce transmission is proving to be culturally completely impossible here. How do you stock up on 30-day supplies when you can only buy a few days’ worth of food? What will you do after that food runs out if your income has been cut off?

While I am worried, I also have endless faith in Bangladesh’s ability to rise in a moment of crisis. Even when outsiders see us as a basket case, we see an innovative path forward. When global health experts said that Bengali mothers couldn’t make oral rehydration solution at home and we’d have to import packets of premade solution, which were heavy and difficult to transport to rural villages given the communications infrastructure in the 1980s, we taught families how to prepare 'lobon-gur' (a mixture of local salt and unrefined sugar) and child mortality plunged. When people in villages were dying of tuberculosis because the hospitals were too far away, we found ways to bring testing and treatment to the community level.

COVID-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world’s best networks of community health workers, a rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience.",,,['432 ICU beds'],

Bangladesh is now possibly heading towards Country Level 4 situation

For an effective national preparedness against coronavirus infection, Bangladesh government last month planned for a few measures needed to be followed to control the outbreak in the country.

The measures includes prevention of mass gathering, ensuring social isolation and countering disinformation.

With its “National Preparedness and Response Plan for Covid-19, Bangladesh”, prepared by Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the government also emphasized on expanding laboratory network and testing capacities.

As per the plan, the health directorate said a total of eleven testing facilities are functioning now and in total at least 28 facilities will be functioning by the end of April.

The number of tests conducted in Bangladesh to detect Covid-19, a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus, patients is alarmingly low, therefore there are doubts on the real number of coronavirus infected people in Bangladesh.

Preparedness to control the pandemic seems to be like fumbling in the dark, when very few people -only 10 in one million- are getting tested.

However, Directorate General of Health Service (DGHS) Director General (DG) Prof Dr Abul Kalam Azad said a total of 14 institutions, including nine in Dhaka, are conducting sample tests across the country to ensure quick confirmation of Covid-19 cases.

On April 2, Prof Dr Abul Kalam told BSS that within the first week of April, all the divisions will have at least one polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory and at the end of the month “we expect to set up and get running a total of 28 laboratories all over the country.”

Categories of the plan

The national plan categorized the situation in four levels. Country Level 1 is when no case is detected in the country, Country Level 2 is when imported cases and limited human to human transmission will be reported, Country Level 3 is when there is a cluster of cases and Country Level 4 is when community transmission is reported.

The Bangladesh government published the plan when no patient was tested positive for Covid-19. However, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) is now hinting on a limited scale community level transmission, which means Bangladesh is now possibly heading towards Country Level 4 categorization.

The Bangladesh government on Monday announced that 35 people were tested positive, which is so far the highest number of Covid-19 infected patients since March 8.

The plan stressed on the importance of screening passengers at the airport a couple of times. However, it stirred criticism when a few thermal scanner machines were reported to be faulty.

The DGHS DG Abul Kalam Azad said the government started screening the suspects at the airport, along with the arrangement of dedicated quarantine zones for people arriving from the affected countries since January.

As of Sunday, Bangladesh has screened a total of 6,67,777 passengers, data compiled by DGHS shows.

Major highlights of the plan

The plan has a chapter on risk communication which says misinformation on all relevant channels, including traditional media and social media, will be countered.

The government has done some work on that front, however, it stirred criticism when the information ministry assigned some of its officials to monitor broadcast media to check whether the media is spreading rumors and misinformation.

Preventing mass gathering was one of the highlights of the national plan but the government received a lot of criticism because right after announcing the general holiday, thousands of people rushed to home in crowded public transportation.

The government requested people to stay at home but it did not halt the public transportation.

The plan states that religious leaders would be sensitized to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. However, the plan does not mention anything clearly about halting religious gathering in mosques, temples, churches or any other place.

Bangladesh made international headlines when at least 25,000 people performed a prayer named Khatme Shifa or Ayat ash-Shifa (Six Quranic Verses of Healing) to seek the containment of the pandemic Covid-19 at the Central Eidgah of Lakshmipur's Raipur on March 18.

Till Sunday, there was no government instruction to halt religious gathering, although the plan states that mass gathering should be prevented if Bangladesh reaches to level three.

However, Islamic Foundation issued a guideline where they requested Imams to continue five-time prayers and Jummah prayers at mosques with limited number of people.

On Monday, the Religious Affairs Ministry issued an emergency notice, suspending prayers at mosques across the country in a bid to stop further spread of Covid-19.

Quarantining, isolating suspects

As for quarantined people, the plan says: “According to guideline provision of accommodation, food and other necessary supplies will be provided. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief will be responsible along with other stakeholders for this.”

However, it did not really elaborate anything about providing supplies for people in home quarantine. It did say, people who have come from abroad must quarantine themselves at their home for 14 days.

However, several media reports revealed that a number of people were not following government instructions and socializing outside before completing their home quarantine period. Lax monitoring of the government was criticized.

The plan states: “Prepare the isolation wards at the designated health facilities -- Kurmitola General Hospital, Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) and Bangladesh Kuwait Moitree Hospital--for isolation and treatment of suspected Covid-19 cases.

“Prepare isolation units in all governmental hospitals; Ensure all private hospitals and clinics are instructed to prepare isolation units at their respective premises.”

However, it did not say how many isolation units are needed if the situation gets worse. It is not clear if those facilities are sufficient for Bangladesh, a country with 167.2 million people.

The plan also suggested to establish intensive care capacity at the divisional and district levels.

Currently, hospitals in Bangladesh have only 1,169 ICU beds (432 govt, 737 private) in total against a population of 161,356,039 people.

At present, only around 34 ICU beds are ready to be used at Bangladesh Kuwait Moitree Hospital and Sheikh Rasel Gastro Liver Institute & Hospital. Besides, 11 more ICU beds are prepared at three private hospitals.

Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque earlier said the government has prepared 200 ICU units for Covid-19 patients, while 11 labs have been set up for testing samples of suspected coronavirus cases.

“As many as 28 more labs will be set up as part of our effort to expand the Covid-19 test facilities across the country,” he said.

‘Bangladesh is now on right track to curb the outbreak’

Amid the allegations by some quarters regarding prior preparation to combat novel coronavirus, DGHS DG Prof Dr Abul Kalam Azad claimed it is not true as the government acted very seriously from the very outset of this global crisis to halt the outbreak of the lethal disease in Bangladesh.

On April, the DG said Bangladesh is now on the right track to curb the outbreak of the Covid-19, reports BSS.

""We prepared designated hospitals, and equipped our health professionals with necessary facilities,"" he claimed.

Prof Abul Kalam Azad said the government closed down all educational institutions in the country, locked down infection-prone areas to prevent community transmission and advised the people to stay at home.

The DG said six hospitals have been prepared in Dhaka for coronavirus patients, while arrangements are underway to treat coronavirus patients in five more hospitals of the capital.

""Separate beds have been kept ready for such patients in district and upazila level hospitals,"" he added.

As of Monday, Bangladesh has reported 12 deaths and 123 infections of Covid-19.

The fast spreading coronavirus, which was first reported in China's Wuhan, has claimed above 69,501 lives and infected more than 1,275,000 people across the world till date, according to Worldometers.

As many as 265,887 people have recovered from coronavirus infection, a pandemic declared by World Health Organization (WHO), which has spread to 208 countries and territories across the planet.",,,"['34 ICU beds', '1,169 ICU beds']",

Bangladesh has a health crisis in the making. The lack of preparation in the United States and Europe that has spawned the ongoing crisis there still exceeds the preparedness of developing countries such as Bangladesh, which will have to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with limited financial resources and a legacy of poor healthcare infrastructure, especially for the urban poor. Already one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh also has thousands of stateless Rohingya housed in sprawling refugee camps in the southeastern region of the country, in conditions prime for rapid spread. Given its proximity to China and a large migrant population living in severely affected countries such as Italy, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should have taken preventative measures when the Chinese government first shared news of the deadly virus. Unfortunately, precious time was squandered.

After the first reported death in Bangladesh from COVID-19, there was a mass religious gathering in the southern part of the country attended by tens of thousands of people. Such events have been discouraged by authorities but communications need to be clearer and more forceful to be effective. Currently there is a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, during which the army is enforcing social distancing across the nation. There are several potential policies the Bangladeshi government can use in its response strategy to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic’s health and economic impact on Bangladesh.

The current situation

The Bangladeshi research institute spearheading the fight to test and detect coronavirus is the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), a body under the Ministry of Health. The IEDCR has recommended that citizens avoid mass public gatherings. Yet, for the March 17 birth centenary of the country’s founder, Sheikh Mijibur Rahman, the government arranged two major public events in Dhaka. These events were supposedly more scaled down from their original intended size, but even so they was still packed with thousands of celebrants, live music, and fireworks.

Unlike in neighboring Nepal where the army set up a quarantine facility in Kathmandu as per the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation upon the first positive COVID-19 test, the handling of quarantine measures in Bangladesh was inadequate. When the first batch of mass returnees arrived from China in February, they were all quarantined at the Ashkana Hajj Camp in Dhaka. The returnees complained about subpar conditions, including poor hygienic conditions and being crammed in small spaces. However, the authorities ignored the situation and the health risks it posed to those in quarantine. Subsequently, in mid-March when the second batch of foreign returnees—over a hundred and forty Bangladeshis evacuated from Italy—arrived, confusion ensued when they were taken to the same inadequate quarantine spot. These returnees protested and were ultimately allowed to leave with the promise of “home quarantine.”

On March 18, tens of thousands of people gathered in Raipur in the southern district of Lakshmipur to pray “healing verses” from the Quran. This event was organized by an influential local religious leader who urged people to join this event, promising a way to be “free from the coronavirus.” The same week, school holidays were announced to support the quarantine, but domestic tourist destinations such as the coastal areas of Chittagong and Cox’s Bazar were all bustling with people and activity. On March 20, the Islamic Foundation allowed congregational prayers to go on albeit for a shortened length.

Such contradiction in policy guidance and lack-luster enforcement has wasted precious time for the government to shore up its limited public health system and to implement best practices for maximizing social distancing and minimizing community transmission of the novel coronavirus. The impact on Bangladesh’s economy due to these missteps is likely to be significant.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that export industries will suffer and the country will lose 1.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) growth due to the pandemic. The ready-made garments sector which accounts for more than 80 percent of Bangladesh’s manufacturing income has already suffered a loss of $3 billion as major export destinations such as the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union are cancelling orders. In addition, foreign remittances representing over 5 percent of GDP (close to $17 billion in fiscal year 2019) will be affected as half a million migrant workers have returned home since the outbreak. The majority of these migrant workers were based in Middle Eastern countries which have been hit by declining oil prices. Furthermore, daily wage laborers, such as rickshaw-pullers, are the hardest hit as the closure of schools and colleges have led to lower demand for their services. For these workers—who survive hand to mouth daily—the consequences of quarantines and lockdowns, however medically necessary, are dire without robust government provision of food and supplementary income.

Some encouraging news

Bangladesh’s government is hardly alone in not tackling the pandemic early enough. Fortunately, after a slow start, the government has begun to show signs of urgency. Following the mass religious gathering in southern Bangladesh, the government started enforcing social distancing measures. Local administrations have been told to punish violators of the home-quarantine rules in line with Section 269 of the Penal Code. Additionally, an emergency lockdown has been imposed in the sub-district of Shibchar since March 19 where many returnees from Italy are based. The general secretary of the ruling party Awami League, Obaidul Quader, said that in the future there may be a possibility of further lockdowns in other areas. Most recently, the government declared a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, wherein all government and private offices have been closed, and with the army mobilized to enforce social distancing across the nation. Almost all international flights have been suspended until April 7 and the country’s March 26 Independence Day celebrations were subdued.

The government encouraged low-income people to return to their villages where they would be provided with government aid or to take refuge in Bhashanchar, an island in the Bay of Bengal originally built to house Rohingya refugees. On March 20, the government authorized the Bangladesh Army to run two quarantine centers in Dhaka. One quarantine facility remains the same Ashkona Hajj Camp that has proved inadequate before. The other is a new one at Rajuk Apartment Project near Diyabari in Uttara.

In the medical arena, there has been progress as well. Isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients have been set up in district-level hospitals across the country. Students and teachers of the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Dhaka have started making low-cost hand sanitizers due to market shortages in the wake of coronavirus fears. And, Gonoshasthaya Kendra, a public health center in Dhaka, received approval from the country’s Directorate of Drug Administration (DGDA) to mass-produce COVID-19 detection kits, each costing around $3.

Recommendations for tackling the situation

Policymakers in Bangladesh should gear up in anticipation of a deterioration of the situation. While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has promised a $6.5 billion package to address the immediate needs of developing member countries (DMCs), and India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged $10 million toward a special emergency fund to set up a rapid response team for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh will have to face this battle largely on its own. Over the past ten days, the South Asia Center has consulted broadly with public health professionals and social scientists who study Bangladesh. Those conversations lead us to offer the following healthcare, social, and economic recommendations:

Health Care

Support initiatives to increase the local production of medical gloves, masks, and other medical kits for health care practitioners who, as the front line defenders, are the most vulnerable. According to Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque, as of now, Bangladesh has adequate testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE), numbering around two hundred thousand units. On March 26, a large consignment of emergency medical supplies provided by the Chinese government arrived. This shipment included 10,000 testing reagents, 15,000 surgical masks, 10,000 medical protective equipment, and 1,000 infrared thermometers. But, as the grim lessons from other countries make clear, in the case of a mass outbreak, even more PPE will be required and more testing needs to be done.

COVID-19 testing facilities should be made available across both public and private medical centers with immediate effect. Once locally produced full-scale standardized and accurate kits are available, testing capabilities should be distributed to other locations in Dhaka and across the country. Bangladesh should commit to mass testing on about one percent of its population to identify community spread of COVID-19. As of March 29, Bangladesh’s official COVID-19 tracker confirms forty-eight cases and five deaths. A press conference that day stated that 1,185 tests have been conducted thus far. This number is much lower in comparison to India and Pakistan, who as of March 29, have tested 27,688 and 14,336 cases respectively.

Implement awareness campaigns for the general public. Unless an individual is over sixty-five and/or has pre-existing health conditions, symptoms should be followed by a six to seven-day quarantine period and individuals should not go to health care facilities. If an individual’s health condition continues to deteriorate, they should then go for COVID-19 testing.

Emotional and mental health services, as well as financial support, should be provided for health workers. The medical community of the nation at this point are severely at high risk and are fearful.

Social

The Ministry of Religious Affairs should endorse the fatwa of the Council of Senior Scholars at Al-Azhar, one of the Muslim world’s top Islamic institutions, where it is permitted under Sharia Law to suspend congregational prayers to counter the spread of the virus. Many Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East including Saudi Arabia have banned gatherings such as in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.

Restaurants and public locations should remain closed after April 4 for a period of at least another ten days, and citizens should be prepared for even longer disruptions of daily life. There must be tougher self-quarantine norms—and if needed lockdown measures—in certain areas of the country with higher concentrations of Bangladeshi expatriates. Sri Lanka had instituted a stay-at-home curfew in eight districts of the country, where violation of this measure has led to the arrest of over 1,600 people. Now that the army has been summoned in Bangladesh, certain districts across the country can be asked to impose curfew-like restrictions, with violations leading to strict punishment and fines.

The government must utilize television, radio, and social media to counter the spread of fraudulent treatment methods through disinformation channels, and to raise appropriate awareness of COVID-19’s dangers for even otherwise healthy victims.

Village community leaders such as Imams and village elders should be involved in spreading information on countering COVID-19. Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government officials have a list of such leaders and can centrally coordinate their response.

Private universities should be mobilized to provide premises for quarantine facilities and temporary hospitals, given that many of them have campuses located right outside Dhaka. Similar initiatives have been taken by higher educational institutions in the United States.

Economic

To protect daily wage laborers who have not left Dhaka to return to their hometowns, tougher lockdown measures accompanied by supportive humanitarian measures should be implemented in slum areas where daily wage workers are concentrated. As in the Rohingya camps, daily wage laborers should be provided with rations for two weeks so that they can observe social distancing measures without risk of starvation or malnutrition. Such a policy could build on the precedent by the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, which will provide free rations to the poor until September. Additionally, as the month of Ramadan is approaching, zakat funds should be collected by both the government and NGOs for this purpose

The government must provide the necessary financing to allow Gonoshasthaya Kendra and other health care organizations to produce their COVID-19 testing kits at requisite volumes and support distributional channels to allow medical facilities around the country to access these kits.

The government must help catalyze the funding required to enable the local production of hand sanitizers and PPEs, which are being made by university students and small tech companies. This will disincentivize counterfeiting and fraud.

Over the next six months, the government must ensure that strategies suggested by the ADB and other international organizations are implemented without delay to minimize the inevitable economic slowdown that will follow even a successful fight against the novel coronavirus.

The global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a once-in-a-generation pathogen that has proven capable of bringing the health systems of the richest countries of the world to their knees. The damage that will be wrought on developing country populations if their governments delay implementation of aggressive countermeasures is unimaginable. Living in densely populated areas with large sections of society reliant on daily wages to make ends meet—and served by public health systems that have been deprived of investment for decades—Bangladeshi citizens are among the world’s most vulnerable to the unchecked spread of this disease. But the situation is not hopeless, and Dhaka must utilize every tool in its arsenal to serve its citizens. The policy checklist presented above is a good place to start.

For weeks, Russia seemed to have dodged a bullet. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raged just across the border in China, Russia was virtually untouched, reporting just seven confirmed infections as recently as 10 March. Since then, the number has risen fast: Russia has now reported 840 infections, about two-thirds of them in the Moscow region.

Some health care providers have questioned whether Russia truly kept the novel coronavirus at bay. Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of Russia’s Alliance of Doctors trade union, has pointed out that pneumonia cases in Moscow spiked in January—they were 37% higher than in January 2019, according to Rosstat, Russia’s statistics agency. She asserts that COVID-19 must have accounted for at least part of the increase. Others attribute the increase to a greater number of pneumonia patients, anxious about the new coronavirus, seeking treatment.

With COVID-19 cases now indisputably on the rise in Russia, authorities are moving fast to ramp up detection and hospital bed capacity. Russia’s federal coronavirus coordination council says 193,000 tests based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been done to date. Swabs initially had to be shipped to Siberia for analysis at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR. Russia’s Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor)—the country’s analog of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—has just expanded testing to its regional laboratories and the Anti-Plague Research Institute.

The agency says it has created a reserve of 700,000 test kits that it will regularly replenish. And the coronavirus council announced yesterday it is allotting 1.4 billion rubles ($17.7 million) to VECTOR, the antiplague facility, and several Rospotrebnadzor labs to spur vaccine and drug development.

To cope with a rising tide of patients, Russia’s federal government is building a new hospital on Moscow’s outskirts. Authorities have called on Moscow residents over age 65 to self-isolate at home—an admonishment that Russian President Vladimir Putin, 67, exempted himself from. But Putin on 24 March donned protective gear while visiting a hospital treating COVID-19 patients, and yesterday he ordered all nonessential workplaces to close from 28 March to 5 April, declaring that “the safest thing is to be at home now.” Today, the government suspended international travel into and out of Russia—starting tomorrow—except for charter flights for bringing expatriates home.

As Russia contends with the mounting COVID-19 threat, Science caught up with Sergey Alkhovsky, a virologist who studies emerging and zoonotic viral infections at the Russian Ministry of Health’s D.I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Q: How do you explain the success of Russia’s containment efforts while cases in China were skyrocketing starting in late January?

A: The border with China was closed at the end of January. The border is long, but in total there are only 16 [legal] crossings. All of them were closed, and only one still worked for evacuation of Russians from China. The railway from China was stopped, and all charter flights were canceled. Only a few airlines remained in operation, arriving at one terminal in Moscow with medical supervision of all arrivals and recording of their residence and contacts. By the way, the first two cases in Russia were found on 31 January in two Chinese tourists.

Q: Yet infectious disease wards in the Moscow region are already reaching capacity.

A: Sick people who had contact with foreigners have been isolated in hospitals starting in early February. So, starting last month, hospitals were full of suspected patients, and their relatives were warned about the danger of infection. [Russia’s coronavirus commission yesterday said 112,000 people are in self-isolation in their homes.]

Q: Where are all these patients coming from?

A: There is some community transmission, but the majority of patients who tested positive arrived from Europe. Unfortunately, measures to restrict air travel with Europe were introduced too late, when outbreaks had already occurred in Italy and other countries. [The first genome of the novel coronavirus sequenced from a Russian patient—a woman in St. Petersburg—placed it in a clade circulating in Europe.]

Q: Initially, Russia allowed work on the novel coronavirus in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) labs. Last week, it relaxed the regulation to allow research in BSL-2 facilities. Why the change?

A: It had become clear that the virus is not so dangerous.

Q: What do you mean?

A: The initial decision of the authorities was to allow work with the virus only at VECTOR. This decision seemed excessive, as it meant many research groups could not get the virus for development and testing of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Now we know more about the virus and these strict requirements are canceled. This will allow for PCR testing in more BSL-2 laboratories and will allow scientists from other institutions to get involved in the work on the virus.

Q: In vaccine and drug R&D?

A: Russia has developed vaccines against tick-borne encephalitis, polio, smallpox, influenza, and other infections. Groups from scientific institutions at Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Health, and the Federal Biomedical Agency have declared they will conduct early vaccine trials in the near future. Within several months, we expect to have two to three vaccine options. But the development of anticoronavirus drugs is still at the very initial stages.","['193,000 tests', '700,000 test kits']",,,

MOSCOW—As the coronavirus pandemic has spread, bringing nations to a halt and killing over 8,000 people in recent weeks around the globe, Russia emerged as a rare spot of calm—or perhaps indifference.

Daily life largely continued as normal, with shops, workplaces, and schools still operating, while the authorities exuded confidence, pointing to only 147 confirmed cases and zero deaths, out of more than 116,000 tests for COVID-19 in the country of about 145 million people—one of the lowest ratios among infected nations in the world. Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, started an oil price war with Saudi Arabia, the global economy be damned.

However, in less than 48 hours, that image has begun to crumble as the Russian government has kicked its response to COVID-19 into overdrive: shutting down its borders, limiting air travel, closing schools, and launching a large economic stimulus as medical experts have begun to question Russia’s official coronavirus statistics and the true efficacy of the response to limit its spread.

Should the true scope of the virus prove to be higher than shown in official statistics, it would mean that the Russian government has missed its chance to slow the pandemic, leaving an already overstretched health care system and weakened economy to deal with the burden of a new national crisis.

“Because the government now understands that infections could jump rapidly, we see new measures being employed to try and contain things very quickly,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. “The key concern is that the medical system doesn’t have the capacity to deal with the coming uptick in cases.”

[Mapping the Coronavirus Outbreak: Get daily updates on the pandemic and learn how it’s affecting countries around the world.]

On Tuesday, Putin toured a new coronavirus information center in Moscow that is pulling together high-tech resources, including surveillance cameras and artificial intelligence, to monitor social media for disinformation about the spread of the disease, properly enforce quarantines, and identify empty supermarket shelves, which have recently been emptied in major cities as Russians have begun stockpiling goods. After the visit, Putin said that he judged the situation in the country to be “under control.”

“We were able to contain the mass penetration and spread” of the pandemic, Putin said during a government meeting of ministers and top officials in Moscow. “The situation is generally under control despite high risk levels.”

In spite of such public assurances, Russia has stepped up its defenses recently. Foreign nationals are now banned from entering until May 1 as part of an effort to slow the spread of the virus, and Moscow has barred all outdoor events and limited indoor gatherings to fewer than 50 people. Older Russians have been told to remain inside. Schools are now closed, as are major tourist attractions, while Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced a $4 billion bailout package on Monday to help businesses that are at risk due to the drop-off in economic activity. Russia has also shut its sizable land borders with its 14 neighbors, and the city of Moscow is currently constructing two large hospitals to house patients infected with the coronavirus.

The recent speed of the government response may in part be due to recognition that the virus is, in fact, spreading throughout the country. While official figures remain low, evidence is emerging that that reality is more severe, with many cases of the virus being misdiagnosed as other ailments. A report published last week by RBC, a Russian business newspaper, found that Rosstat, the country’s official statistics agency, has recorded an increase of 37 percent of cases of “community-acquired pneumonia” in January as compared to January 2019, which could fit similar symptoms to the coronavirus. Such an increase would represent nearly 2,000 cases.

Other evidence that a much larger spread of the virus could be hiding in Russia was put forward by the Doctor’s Alliance, a recently formed countrywide union for medical professionals, who said that the true figure of those infected with the new coronavirus could be in the thousands, but that many cases have likely been labelled as pneumonia. In a recent video posted on the group’s YouTube channel, the organization also warned about a lack of protective gear in hospitals outside of major cities in Russia’s regions that could lead to more infections. The video also featured anonymous calls from doctors who said that they were being told to clear entire hospital wards in order to accommodate a flood of patients suffering from “pneumonia.”

A report by the Russian outlet Meduza also pointed to a similar development in St. Petersburg, which has recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, but where local hospitals have run out of space due to an influx of influenza and pneumonia patients.

The small official figures for coronavirus cases and the more muted government response in Russia compared to its peers around the world stem from a combination of economic, political, and practical realities inside the country.

Coronavirus testing in Russia is currently a monopoly run by a lab in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow, where the testing procedure is overseen by Rospotrebnadzor, the state health watchdog. This means that the lab faces a thickening bottleneck and growing backlog in terms of delivering results. Moreover, tests in Russia are conducted via a locally developed version, which some medical experts have said may not be accurate enough to identify all cases of the virus. On top of that, a longstanding lack of trust in the medical system may be preventing some sick patients from coming forward for testing.

“People won’t go see a doctor, because many are accustomed to home remedies, and there is a deep distrust in the health system, especially outside of Moscow,” said Judy Twigg, an expert on public health in Russia at Virginia Commonwealth University.

The Russian government has also been somewhat resistant to sound the alarm about the virus due to the country’s struggling economy, which has been hit by twin shocks of a global downturn caused by the spread of the coronavirus and an ongoing oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Until just a few weeks ago, Putin was promising Russians that their stagnant incomes would finally pick up along with the economy this year, but recent developments have dashed those hopes, and limiting their impact appears to be a top priority for the Kremlin.

“The government knows that people don’t have much savings and that businesses run on monthly cash flow,” said Gabuev from the Carnegie Moscow Center. “The concern is how to do a proper quarantine and not cause a massive economic disruption in the process.”

In terms of managing the virus, the Russian government responded quickly at the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020 by shutting down its 2,600-mile border with China and limiting flights between the two countries. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, who was recently appointed by Putin to head a coronavirus task force, also enacted a series of controversial policies targeting the Chinese community, such as raids on work sites with Chinese laborers and asking city bus drivers to report when Chinese-looking passengers got on board. The measures earned a rare rebuke from the Chinese Embassy in Moscow, which complained directly to the Kremlin. According to official numbers, the tough border measures appear to have worked, with the majority of confirmed cases in Russia coming from citizens who were abroad in Europe, particularly in Italy.

Since then, the Russian capital has remained on “high-alert,” with strict policies implemented, but Moscow has so far refrained from calling for a national emergency, as has been done across Europe. The city has said that anyone ignoring quarantine requirements could face up to five years in prison, and the authorities have used Moscow’s widespread facial-recognition network to monitor people under quarantine, even issuing fines when some have gone outside to drop off the trash.

But while Russia has taken tough new measures this week to slow the spread of the virus, restaurants, bars, and shopping malls currently remain open. Similarly, while many businesses have already told employees to work from home, Sobyanin only issued an official decree on Wednesday for Moscow employees to work from home.

“The longer you keep things open and hold back on the social distancing side of things for fear of the economic situation, the more you are delaying an inevitable spike in the spread of the virus,” Twigg said.

Meanwhile, Russia’s political life continues to move forward even while the pandemic is hitting closer to home. Despite concerns about large crowds of people gathering, Putin confirmed on Tuesday a planned nationwide vote on April 22 on constitutional amendments that would allow him to run for two more terms as president.

Similarly, the Kremlin said that it would continue with rehearsals for its Victory Day parade in May, which will mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II and could involve up to 10,000 soldiers training together.","['116,000 tests']",,,

Whether or not Russia’s healthcare system will be able to withstand the coronavirus pandemic is an open question. One way to move toward an answer is to compare conditions in Russia to those in Italy. Local doctors working in the hard-hit Lombardy region have repeatedly pointed to a shortage of ventilators, devices that can be necessary to keep patients breathing in severe cases. Data collected by Meduza indicates that Russia’s supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries. That said, ventilators alone are not enough to overcome the pandemic. In a number of other areas, comparing Russian and Italian health infrastructure doesn’t bode well at all for Russia.

Italy is among the countries hardest hit by the novel coronavirus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 19, there were almost 36,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy, and 2,978 of those individuals had died, meaning that the virus is spreading faster in Italy than in any other country. Every day, hundreds of new cases and deaths are recorded despite a March 10 nationwide quarantine order.

Northern Italy is engaged in an especially vicious struggle against the virus. The country’s COVID-19 outbreak began in Lombardy, which remains the epicenter of Italy’s pandemic. Even in the wealthiest areas of one of the most highly developed countries in the European Union, healthcare systems are buckling under the weight of a crisis for which they were catastrophically unprepared. In one viral Facebook post, surgeon Daniele Macchini of Bergamo compared the working conditions in his hospital to the effects of a war or the aftermath of a tsunami. The number of patients infected is rising geometrically, more and more doctors and nurses are contracting the virus themselves, and every ventilator is worth its weight in gold.

Why are artificial breathing aids necessary, and how extreme do they get?

Between 20 and 30 percent of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized require intensive care. Among those patients, 47 to 71 percent require artificial lung ventilation in order for their bodies to absorb enough oxygen. That number is equivalent to between two and four percent of all infected patients.

In especially severe cases, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) may be used. This complex procedure involves redirecting the patient’s blood through a device outside the body that adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, fulfilling the key functions of breathing without relying on the patient’s lungs. ECMO may be called for in 0.1 – 0.3 percent of COVID-19 cases, but its effectiveness in the pandemic is still in doubt. The procedure carries an increased risk of blood clots and infections, and ventilators may be even more effective if used with additional steps. For example, patients who do not regain enough oxygen may be turned onto their stomachs during ventilation to increase the space available to their lungs, and doctors can artificially shut down muscle activity to decrease the patient’s oxygen needs and their body’s resistance to the ventilation process.

Given the risks involved, ECMO devices are rarely used, including in Russia. For example, the Yudin City Clinical Hospital, which has the largest number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds of any Moscow institution — 144 of them, to be exact — has used ECMO only five times within the last year. The necessary equipment is expensive, and using it requires highly specific skills. The WHO has recommended using ECMO in COVID-19 cases only if an experienced specialist is available.

How many ventilators and ECMO machines are there in Russia?

Meduza collected data from open sources to find out how many ventilators and ECMO devices government hospitals have on hand in most of Russia’s regions as well as Crimea. We also compared those numbers to the population of each region. The results are in the table below; regions are ranked by number of ventilators per capita. While we have included the relevant statistics for Italy, the U.S., the U.K., and Ukraine as benchmarks, there may be differences in exactly how those data were collected from country to country. For example, while the figures for Russia only account for public institutions, the U.K. data cover private and military ones as well.

These data paint a relatively optimistic picture for Russia: The country significantly surpasses Western countries in terms of ventilator availability. For example, on average, there are 27.3 ventilators in Russia for every 100,000 people, while in the U.S., according to official data from Johns Hopkins University, ICUs have a total of 62,000 ventilators. That makes for only 18.8 ventilators per 100,000 people. In Russian state hospitals, there are 40,000 ventilators, and hospitals are also purchasing new ones as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.

Meanwhile, according to Italy’s national emergencies ministry (known as the Protezione Civile), there are about 5,000 ventilators for the entire country. That makes for 8.3 ventilators per 100,000 residents — less than half of the same figure for Russia’s Ivanovo region, which has about the same population density as Kentucky. Italy has made an urgent attempt to buy enough ventilators to double the national supply, but medical equipment manufacturers worldwide are already struggling to keep up with the flood of orders triggered by the pandemic, according to Reuters.

In the United Kingdom, where doctors from the National Health Service (NHS) are also warning that the country is catastrophically unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, Parliament’s Health and Social Care Committee has counted a total of 8,175 ventilators throughout the country, including those intended for children and those located in private clinics and military storage. That’s only 12.9 machines for every 100,000 people, which is also less than almost any region in Russia.

“Moscow is completely equipped with the necessary equipment. There are approximately 5,000 ventilation apparatuses accounted for in the city at this time. 265 additional machines are on reserve for potential coronavirus patients,” Moscow’s Healthcare Department told Meduza. It is nonetheless worth noting that not all of those ventilators are available for immediate use at any given time: Other patients who can’t breathe on their own may be connected to them already.

On top of its 40,000 state-owned ventilators, Russia can also draw on the resources of its private clinics, which could be mobilized to respond to a sudden spike in cases. There is also a private rental market for ventilators in Russia. It is currently used primarily by relatives of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients for in-home care, but some of its devices could be redirected to hospitals. This does not mean that Russians will be able to count on using their very own ventilator by any means. While “ventilators” are sold freely in the country, and they can cost anywhere from 100,000 rubles ($1,252) for mobile versions intended to work only part of the day up to several million rubles for full-fledged machines, only specially trained professionals can use these devices. Without a specialist nearby, rental ventilators will be useless.

Currently, at least according to official case counts, Russia is “behind” many other countries in the typical timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 20, 2020, the country’s national consumer welfare agency Rospotrebnadzor had reported 253 confirmed infections. The first confirmed death of a coronavirus patient in Russia occurred on March 19 in Moscow’s Infectious Disease Hospital No. 2. The patient was 79 years old and chronically ill; her cause of death was recorded as “a bursting blood clot, not pneumonia,” said Moscow’s chief pathologist, Oleg Zairatyants.

Most Russians who have been infected with the novel coronavirus are currently being treated at Moscow’s City Clinical Hospital No. 40. On the morning of March 20, the hospital’s lead doctor, Denis Protsenko, wrote on Facebook that none of those COVID-19 patients has yet required artificial lung ventilation.

So it’s not that bad? Russians have reliable protection from the pandemic?

An abundance of ventilators actually may not be a decisive advantage in this crisis. Vladimir Budyansky, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician who moderates the 14,400-member Facebook group “Medical Emergencies,” told Meduza that there are various kinds of ventilators. Some are advanced devices produced in the West that can provide 24-hour ventilation for patients experiencing health crises of various levels. Others are “old-fashioned,” in his words, and can’t be used for contemporary lung ventilation procedures at all.

“On top of that, artificial lung ventilation is quite a fine-tuned, complicated process,” Budyansky said. “It requires a lot of other things [aside from the ventilator itself]. There are anesthetic devices that still allow for ventilation, but those are supposed to be for operations, and they don’t have a range of settings. Using a ventilator with a patient in the ICU or the emergency room is something of a different, more complex task that can take five to 10 days, sometimes months — not several hours, which is what it can take on the operating table,” he explained. “There are mobile ‘ventilators’ that are housed in ambulances — those are meant to ventilate patients for anywhere from one to 12 hours. In short, this isn’t a single kind of device; it’s a spectrum of various different devices. It’s like with cars: Some are for driving off-road, and some are for driving in cities.”

Aside from the question of whether the ventilators available actually fit patients’ needs, there’s the fact that if a patient has to be on a ventilator, they’re already in critical condition. That means they need a whole set of critical care procedures, specialized equipment, and medical professionals who can use that equipment and put those measures in place. In Budyansky’s opinion, this is where Russian medicine loses out to Italy.

“The Italian healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world in all the rankings that are out there. It’s always been in the top five. I’ve seen their level of training myself. All else held equal, we’ll have a relatively spotty situation with treating critically ill patients in some regions of the country,” the doctor explained. “Their problem wasn’t so much with the ventilators as it was with beds, with the fact that they had to turn operating rooms into intensive care units on the fly.”

“But let’s say we take your average ICU: 20 beds, and each one has one person on artificial ventilation. We have the same equipment they do, there are doctors, there are nurses. I think that in a lot of situations, we’ll have it worse for a variety of reasons. For example, when they say they don’t have enough nurses, for them, that means there used to be one nurse per patient, and now, there’s one for every two. Well, we’ve got one nurse serving three or four or five already. So what’s twice as bad as usual for them is two times better than what we have normally,” Budyansky concluded.

But when it does, as many experts soon expect, it could prove a huge challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a fragile time for his rule.

Putin markets himself as Russia’s hero, the only man who can restore the former Soviet Union’s greatness and bring stability to his country. Anything that messes with that image, whether it’s large-scale protests, a prominent opposition leader, or questions about his leadership, ruins the myth he and his allies have cultivated for decades.

A significant Covid-19 outbreak in Russia, and particularly in the densely populated capital of Moscow, would be devastating to the dictator. If tens of thousands get sick and die, it would puncture the narrative armor Putin has around himself. That high death toll is distinctly possible, as medical resources outside Russia’s major cities are scarce and the country’s older population is at high risk.

The looming crisis couldn’t come at a worse time for Russia. Oil prices, the lifeblood of its economy, have tanked. A transition plan to keep Putin in power until 2036 is delayed. And early data this year shows Russians are contracting “pneumonia” at higher rates than in the past; some critics say that it’s actually Covid-19, and that the government is manipulating statistics to make it seem like the spread isn’t that bad.

Put together, this is a “perfect storm of problems for the Kremlin,” said Alina Polyakova, a Russia expert and president of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington.

It doesn’t help that despite some early aggressive measures like closing its borders, including the 2,600-mile one with China, experts say the Russian government response was not enough. Doctors have conducted few tests for the virus, blinding authorities to just how widespread the outbreak might be.

Concerns have risen to the point that Moscow’s mayor, a Putin ally, has continuously and openly asserted the situation is surely worse than it appears.

The stream of bad news had Putin hiding in the shadows, not wanting to take the fall for the deadly mishaps. But now that the number of cases continues to rise — and quickly — Putin has visibly taken command of the response. After all, he, more than anyone, is aware of the precarious moment in his leadership.

Yet a top Russian doctor who shook hands with Putin during a recent hospital tour tested positive for the coronavirus last week — underscoring how perilous the situation is.

“It’s a big challenge,” Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center, told me.

And there’s a chance Putin can’t withstand it.

Russia is headed for a US-sized crisis

No one can accuse the Russian government of standing by as the coronavirus swept across the globe.

On January 30, the government closed its large, far-eastern border with China and suspended the issue of electronic visas to Chinese people. Days later, it evacuated Russians in China on military airplanes and threatened to deport foreigners who tested positive for the disease.

That same month, passengers flying into Moscow from China, Iran, and South Korea — the coronavirus epicenters at the time — had to undergo tests once they stepped off the plane. Meanwhile, citizens returning from Europe would have their temperatures checked and be ordered to quarantine for 14 days at home.

Experts note these measures, while tough, at best limited the number of infected people in the country and perhaps prevented a larger outbreak. On their own, though, they weren’t enough — and that’s where Russia went wrong.

Covid-19 tests had to be conducted with a locally made device many viewed as faulty. All completed tests had to be sent to a single lab in Siberia for results, causing a massive backlog at the facility. This allowed Russians to continue living their normal lives without knowing if they carried the disease or not, and blinded the Kremlin from tracking the spread.

Weeks went by before Russia took additive measures. It wasn’t until mid-March that Russia chose to close schools and certain businesses, limit air travel, and consider a large economic stimulus package to alleviate financial strain on the people. But by then, it was all but assured that the small number of cases Russia had early on would grow.

It’s not that Russia responded slowly, said Dr. Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, it’s that “the response from the beginning was not adequate.”

It hasn’t gotten much better. Last week, Putin announced a week-long vacation for the entire country, hoping that would compel Russians to stay home and socially distance from one another. Instead, thousands in Moscow and around the nation went outside to enjoy the nice weather and time off. It forced the Kremlin two days later to reiterate that the government wanted everyone to stay inside, not go out for joy rides.

And as major regional governments imposed shelter-in-place rules last week, people continued to ignore the orders. even as police drove around to remind everyone to head back inside. That’s a quintessentially Russian trait, according to experts.

“The people were not forced from the beginning” to stay inside, Vlassov told me. “That’s because they actually adapted to be forced from the Soviet time. If no one is forced, then it can’t be that serious.”

Trying to make people take the orders more seriously, the Kremlin passed a measure that could see those found violating the lockdown measures imprisoned for up to seven years.

Those heavy-handed measures may do some good, experts say, but it probably still isn’t enough. “It’s my fear that it’s too little, too late,” Judy Twigg, an expert on health care in Russia at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me.

What comes next could be catastrophic.

Russia is “probably in the early stage of the same epidemic which is going on in the United States now,” Michael Favorov, who led the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s Eastern European and Central Asian programs, told me. “They are facing significant increases of cases within the next month” in the capital and beyond, “and a significant increase in the number of deaths.”

The question, then, is why Putin and his allies failed to impose all necessary measures early on when they likely could have done the most good. The answer is that Putin prioritized politics over public health.

Putin’s precarious political position

In a way, Putin brought this dire predicament upon himself.

Back in January, Russia’s entire government resigned as part of a major constitutional reform to give Putin more power and extend his rule 12 years beyond his current end date in 2024.

As Vox’s Jen Kirby explained at the time:

Putin’s proposed constitutional reforms broadly seek to limit the power of the presidency and give more responsibilities to the Parliament, including the job of choosing the country’s prime minister. He also intends to give more power to the State Council, an advisory body to the head of state that doesn’t have a ton of authority right now... The problem is that Putin’s constitutional changes intend to limit the power of a president who is not him, thus ensuring his successor is far weaker than he has been.

The referendum vote to give him that authority — which he was widely expected win — was scheduled for April 22. But due to the outbreak, the Russian leader last week postponed the vote, saying medical professionals will tell him when the time is right to schedule it again.

“You know that this is a very serious matter for me. Of course, I will ask you to go to the polling stations to express your opinion on this issue of fundamental and crucial importance to the country and society,” Putin said in his March 25 address to the nation. “Our absolute priority is the health, life and safety of the people. This is why I believe the vote should be postponed.”

In the meantime, Putin doesn’t want to make millions of Russian lives miserable ahead of the vote, or at a minimum give them more reason to question his bid for power. Draconian measures would make it look like his government doesn’t have the situation under control, and the Center for European Analysis’s Polyakova said stability is central to Putin’s pitch.

Politically speaking, “this crisis comes at the worst moment for him,” she told me.

He also made a big miscalculation. In early March, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a cartel of 15 countries of oil-producing nations, met at OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna to discuss what to do as the disease’s impact has lowered global demand for oil.

Russia is not part of the bloc, but Russian officials were invited to the meeting. That’s because three years ago Russia made a deal to coordinate its production levels with the group, in a pact known as OPEC+.

At the meeting, Saudi Arabia, the cartel’s leader, suggested the participants collectively cut their oil production by about 1 million barrels per day, with Russia making the most dramatic cut of around 500,000 barrels a day.

Doing so would have kept oil prices higher, which would bring in more revenue for nations in the bloc whose economies are heavily dependent on crude exports. Saudi Arabia considered the move necessary because demand from Asia, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus, plummeted.

The Russians, long wary of such a move, opted against the plan. It’s still unclear exactly why, but some said Putin wanted prices to stay low to hurt the American shale oil industry or was gearing up to seize a bigger sliver of Asian and global oil demand for Russia.

Saudi Arabia didn’t take too kindly to the Kremlin’s decision and responded by slashing its export prices that weekend to start a price war with Russia. That brought the price per barrel down by about $11 to $35 a barrel — the biggest one-day drop since 1991.

As of April 6, oil stands around $30 a barrel, and that’s disastrous from Russia’s point of view. The country heavily depends on oil revenues to fill the government’s coffers. Without a large, reliable amount of money coming in, Putin will have fewer funds to spend on his nation, let alone deal with a growing health crisis at home.

For Putin to mess with the oil market as Covid-19 cases grew around the world, Polyakova says, shows he sometimes lets short-term thinking drive his long-lasting, impactful decision-making.

And now that the coronavirus crisis is growing in Russia, Putin will surely wish he could take that blunder back.

Russia’s health care system is fairly well prepared, but the coronavirus will likely overwhelm it

Favorov, the former CDC official, told me that the current Russian health care system was built in the Soviet era, with its focus primarily on preventing large-scale disasters. In 1919, for example, Vladimir Lenin issued a nationwide decree that everyone should get a smallpox vaccination. Those who didn’t follow the order at best were jailed, and at worst killed.

To this day, a focus on preventing public health crises remains, Favorov said. “The system is highly sensitive to any diseases which might be a threat to public health.”

Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization’s representative to Russia, told me the country is fairly well prepared for an outbreak. It has “a massive public health information campaign to raise awareness and preventive measures,” she said, with around 70,000 hospital beds and 40,000 ventilators.

But, she made sure to note, “it is human behavior that determines the outcome of outbreaks and that is why public health information [is] of highest importance to address any health challenge.”

Russia’s health care system isn’t in poor shape. In fact, Russian propaganda continues to claim that the country is better prepared than the United States for what’s coming, even noting how Putin offered President Donald Trump assistance. In fact, a Russian plane with medical equipment was dispatched to the US already.

There’s no doubt Russia can handle a major outbreak better than many nations, if and when it gets really bad, because it has the means. But there are still major problems that will affect care in the country.

VCU’s Twigg said that a lot of the equipment Russian hospitals have, including ventilators, break down with alarming frequency. Russia is having more produced, but it’s unclear if those who need them will have them in time, especially as the rich hoard them. Further, Russia is short of the equipment that goes with ventilators, like oxygen or anesthetic sedatives. And, Twigg says, it’s unclear if the country has enough well-trained 24/7 intensive care nurses to staff patients on ventilators.

That’s not all: According to Vlassov, the epidemiologist in Moscow, Russia increased salaries for physicians in recent years. While that helped attract top talent, it lowered the amount of funds available to buy top-of-the-line materials for medical care. What’s more, the government’s focus in spending more on the health care sector was on building new hospitals, not investing in protective equipment for doctors.

Beyond that, the system may have failed in a greater sense.

According to the Russian government’s own official statistics, Moscow saw 6,921 pneumonia cases in January, compared to 5,058 during the same period the year before. That’s a 37 percent increase, and those figures come from physicians who report them to the government.

It’s possible that Russia had a spike of pneumonia cases, experts tell me, and some pneumonia cases have gone undiagnosed as Covid-19 cases in other countries. Some, though, have alleged that the statistics may have been manipulated to make it seem like the outbreak wasn’t so bad.

“While the whole world is facing an outbreak of a new coronavirus, Russia is facing an outbreak of a community-acquired pneumonia. And as usual, we’re facing the lie of the authorities,” Anastasia Vasilyeva, president of the Doctors’ Alliance trade union and an ally of a top Putin opponent, said in a YouTube video last month. She was detained on April 3 by Russian authorities.

It may sound like a conspiracy theory, but there’s precedent for this view. In 2015, Putin said he wanted to lower the death rate caused by cardiovascular disease in Russia. Almost immediately, hospitals began to report that fewer people were dying from heart conditions. What made that more suspicious is that there was a rise — at about the same rate — of deaths from other causes.

The only thing that could assure Russia can deal with what’s coming, then, is massive interest and involvement from Putin. Despite many earlier stumbles, he may have just started to take the crisis very seriously.

Can Putin be Russia’s coronavirus hero?

Putin doesn’t like to be the bearer of bad news. When things look to be headed the wrong way, he usually asks a loyalist to be the face of the government response in case it fails.

“There’s a big joke in Russia that the person who gets the finance portfolio will be the person everyone’s going to hate,” CEPA’s Polyakova told me, chuckling.

Putin followed that playbook with Russia’s initial response to the coronavirus. He had a loyalist, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, take charge, allowing Putin to remain in the shadows. The appointment had a veneer of legitimacy, as Moscow was the epicenter of the country’s outbreak, but experts agree Putin aimed to distance himself from the situation.

That position soon became untenable, especially once Sobyanin continued to make clear that the problem likely was worse than it seemed. “Nobody knows the real picture,” the mayor openly told Putin last week, alluding to the lack of widespread testing. “In reality, there are far more people who are infected.”

It’s why few are surprised that Putin has become a much more visible figure in recent days. He was seen sporting a yellow hazmat suit while visiting a coronavirus hospital in Moscow. Incidentally, the top doctor at that hospital who was pictured shaking hands with Putin tested positive this week for Covid-19, causing Putin to work remotely for the time being.

And in a recent videoconference with government members, Putin told them to start getting serious and tell him truthful information when he needs it. “The results of our work should correspond to what is happening at present,” he said. That, for VCU’s Twigg, was surprising. “It was an implicit admission that what’s been going on until now was everybody lying to each other,” she told me.

Putin, then, is on the case — but he still faces serious hurdles to get the response right.

The most important will be quashing the expected major outbreak in Moscow. Many experts told me the disease spread there could end up being worse than the one in New York City, partly because of how densely populated the Russian capital is. That’d be extremely damaging for Putin: If he can’t keep people in the showpiece capital safe, it would hurt his image as the country’s protector.

That has many worried Putin will zero in on Moscow at the expense of other parts of the country.

It could pose serious problems, as the many Russians who defied orders to stay inside may have traveled to nearby vacation spots of their hometowns. If they brought the disease with them, an outbreak could pop up across the country’s 11 time zones while Putin solely tackles the Moscow challenge. Russia is already using surveillance tools on phones to track people during the outbreak.

Hospitals outside the major cities aren’t well-equipped, experts told me, with some estimates saying they’ve cumulatively lost about 50 percent of their capacity over the last decade. If they’re outside Putin’s interests, they will struggle to care for patients.

“For big cities, the situation may be rather manageable,” Carnegie’s Stanovaya told me, “but in the countryside, it will be difficult.”

But another problem arises if the Moscow outbreak gets significantly worse. If the number of positive cases and deaths tick upward, there will be immense pressure on Putin to take drastic measures to stop the spread. That could mean sending out law enforcement on the streets, experts say, forcing people inside. It’d be a very visible symbol of just how out of control the situation had become.

Vlassov, the epidemiologist in Moscow, relayed a broader worry he has. Every apartment building in the capital has an electronic system to get inside, as well as cameras at the entrance. If the Kremlin decides the people can’t be trusted to stay in their homes, he says many in the city fear the government will lock the doors on the millions of inhabitants. After all, those locks are part of a city-wide, state-approved system.

“People discuss it in the context of an epidemic, but also in the context of a public uprising against the government,” he said.

It’s unclear what Putin plans to do next, or if his newfound vigor in dealing with the health crisis will keep Russia from ruin. Most agree, though, that Putin will take whatever steps he must to ensure the crisis doesn’t bring his country to a breaking point.

“It all depends on the magnitude of the outbreak,” said Favorov, the former CDC official. But, he added, as soon as the Kremlin needs to ramp up its efforts, “they will do it in the old Soviet style.”",['19 tests'],"['40,000 ventilators']","['70,000 hospital beds']",

Whether or not Russia’s healthcare system will be able to withstand the coronavirus pandemic is an open question. One way to move toward an answer is to compare conditions in Russia to those in Italy. Local doctors working in the hard-hit Lombardy region have repeatedly pointed to a shortage of ventilators, devices that can be necessary to keep patients breathing in severe cases. Data collected by Meduza indicates that Russia’s supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries. That said, ventilators alone are not enough to overcome the pandemic. In a number of other areas, comparing Russian and Italian health infrastructure doesn’t bode well at all for Russia.

Italy is among the countries hardest hit by the novel coronavirus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 19, there were almost 36,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy, and 2,978 of those individuals had died, meaning that the virus is spreading faster in Italy than in any other country. Every day, hundreds of new cases and deaths are recorded despite a March 10 nationwide quarantine order.

Northern Italy is engaged in an especially vicious struggle against the virus. The country’s COVID-19 outbreak began in Lombardy, which remains the epicenter of Italy’s pandemic. Even in the wealthiest areas of one of the most highly developed countries in the European Union, healthcare systems are buckling under the weight of a crisis for which they were catastrophically unprepared. In one viral Facebook post, surgeon Daniele Macchini of Bergamo compared the working conditions in his hospital to the effects of a war or the aftermath of a tsunami. The number of patients infected is rising geometrically, more and more doctors and nurses are contracting the virus themselves, and every ventilator is worth its weight in gold.

Why are artificial breathing aids necessary, and how extreme do they get?

Between 20 and 30 percent of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized require intensive care. Among those patients, 47 to 71 percent require artificial lung ventilation in order for their bodies to absorb enough oxygen. That number is equivalent to between two and four percent of all infected patients.

In especially severe cases, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) may be used. This complex procedure involves redirecting the patient’s blood through a device outside the body that adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, fulfilling the key functions of breathing without relying on the patient’s lungs. ECMO may be called for in 0.1 – 0.3 percent of COVID-19 cases, but its effectiveness in the pandemic is still in doubt. The procedure carries an increased risk of blood clots and infections, and ventilators may be even more effective if used with additional steps. For example, patients who do not regain enough oxygen may be turned onto their stomachs during ventilation to increase the space available to their lungs, and doctors can artificially shut down muscle activity to decrease the patient’s oxygen needs and their body’s resistance to the ventilation process.

Given the risks involved, ECMO devices are rarely used, including in Russia. For example, the Yudin City Clinical Hospital, which has the largest number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds of any Moscow institution — 144 of them, to be exact — has used ECMO only five times within the last year. The necessary equipment is expensive, and using it requires highly specific skills. The WHO has recommended using ECMO in COVID-19 cases only if an experienced specialist is available.

How many ventilators and ECMO machines are there in Russia?

Meduza collected data from open sources to find out how many ventilators and ECMO devices government hospitals have on hand in most of Russia’s regions as well as Crimea. We also compared those numbers to the population of each region. The results are in the table below; regions are ranked by number of ventilators per capita. While we have included the relevant statistics for Italy, the U.S., the U.K., and Ukraine as benchmarks, there may be differences in exactly how those data were collected from country to country. For example, while the figures for Russia only account for public institutions, the U.K. data cover private and military ones as well.

These data paint a relatively optimistic picture for Russia: The country significantly surpasses Western countries in terms of ventilator availability. For example, on average, there are 27.3 ventilators in Russia for every 100,000 people, while in the U.S., according to official data from Johns Hopkins University, ICUs have a total of 62,000 ventilators. That makes for only 18.8 ventilators per 100,000 people. In Russian state hospitals, there are 40,000 ventilators, and hospitals are also purchasing new ones as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.

Meanwhile, according to Italy’s national emergencies ministry (known as the Protezione Civile), there are about 5,000 ventilators for the entire country. That makes for 8.3 ventilators per 100,000 residents — less than half of the same figure for Russia’s Ivanovo region, which has about the same population density as Kentucky. Italy has made an urgent attempt to buy enough ventilators to double the national supply, but medical equipment manufacturers worldwide are already struggling to keep up with the flood of orders triggered by the pandemic, according to Reuters.

In the United Kingdom, where doctors from the National Health Service (NHS) are also warning that the country is catastrophically unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, Parliament’s Health and Social Care Committee has counted a total of 8,175 ventilators throughout the country, including those intended for children and those located in private clinics and military storage. That’s only 12.9 machines for every 100,000 people, which is also less than almost any region in Russia.

“Moscow is completely equipped with the necessary equipment. There are approximately 5,000 ventilation apparatuses accounted for in the city at this time. 265 additional machines are on reserve for potential coronavirus patients,” Moscow’s Healthcare Department told Meduza. It is nonetheless worth noting that not all of those ventilators are available for immediate use at any given time: Other patients who can’t breathe on their own may be connected to them already.

On top of its 40,000 state-owned ventilators, Russia can also draw on the resources of its private clinics, which could be mobilized to respond to a sudden spike in cases. There is also a private rental market for ventilators in Russia. It is currently used primarily by relatives of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients for in-home care, but some of its devices could be redirected to hospitals. This does not mean that Russians will be able to count on using their very own ventilator by any means. While “ventilators” are sold freely in the country, and they can cost anywhere from 100,000 rubles ($1,252) for mobile versions intended to work only part of the day up to several million rubles for full-fledged machines, only specially trained professionals can use these devices. Without a specialist nearby, rental ventilators will be useless.

Currently, at least according to official case counts, Russia is “behind” many other countries in the typical timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 20, 2020, the country’s national consumer welfare agency Rospotrebnadzor had reported 253 confirmed infections. The first confirmed death of a coronavirus patient in Russia occurred on March 19 in Moscow’s Infectious Disease Hospital No. 2. The patient was 79 years old and chronically ill; her cause of death was recorded as “a bursting blood clot, not pneumonia,” said Moscow’s chief pathologist, Oleg Zairatyants.

Most Russians who have been infected with the novel coronavirus are currently being treated at Moscow’s City Clinical Hospital No. 40. On the morning of March 20, the hospital’s lead doctor, Denis Protsenko, wrote on Facebook that none of those COVID-19 patients has yet required artificial lung ventilation.

So it’s not that bad? Russians have reliable protection from the pandemic?

An abundance of ventilators actually may not be a decisive advantage in this crisis. Vladimir Budyansky, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician who moderates the 14,400-member Facebook group “Medical Emergencies,” told Meduza that there are various kinds of ventilators. Some are advanced devices produced in the West that can provide 24-hour ventilation for patients experiencing health crises of various levels. Others are “old-fashioned,” in his words, and can’t be used for contemporary lung ventilation procedures at all.

“On top of that, artificial lung ventilation is quite a fine-tuned, complicated process,” Budyansky said. “It requires a lot of other things [aside from the ventilator itself]. There are anesthetic devices that still allow for ventilation, but those are supposed to be for operations, and they don’t have a range of settings. Using a ventilator with a patient in the ICU or the emergency room is something of a different, more complex task that can take five to 10 days, sometimes months — not several hours, which is what it can take on the operating table,” he explained. “There are mobile ‘ventilators’ that are housed in ambulances — those are meant to ventilate patients for anywhere from one to 12 hours. In short, this isn’t a single kind of device; it’s a spectrum of various different devices. It’s like with cars: Some are for driving off-road, and some are for driving in cities.”

Aside from the question of whether the ventilators available actually fit patients’ needs, there’s the fact that if a patient has to be on a ventilator, they’re already in critical condition. That means they need a whole set of critical care procedures, specialized equipment, and medical professionals who can use that equipment and put those measures in place. In Budyansky’s opinion, this is where Russian medicine loses out to Italy.

“The Italian healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world in all the rankings that are out there. It’s always been in the top five. I’ve seen their level of training myself. All else held equal, we’ll have a relatively spotty situation with treating critically ill patients in some regions of the country,” the doctor explained. “Their problem wasn’t so much with the ventilators as it was with beds, with the fact that they had to turn operating rooms into intensive care units on the fly.”

“But let’s say we take your average ICU: 20 beds, and each one has one person on artificial ventilation. We have the same equipment they do, there are doctors, there are nurses. I think that in a lot of situations, we’ll have it worse for a variety of reasons. For example, when they say they don’t have enough nurses, for them, that means there used to be one nurse per patient, and now, there’s one for every two. Well, we’ve got one nurse serving three or four or five already. So what’s twice as bad as usual for them is two times better than what we have normally,” Budyansky concluded.

The neighbors’ economies are intertwined.

So why is there such a big difference in cases?

AD

The disparity reflects, in part, a time lag. Mexico did not report its first case until Feb. 27 — a month after the virus was detected in the United States. To date, the country has counted 993 cases, less than 1 percent of the U.S. total.

AD

But Mexico is also pursuing an unorthodox strategy. It is relying less on tests, and more on its own disease modeling, to guide its response to the pandemic. As Central American neighbors declared emergencies in mid-March, Mexico kept its airports, shops and government offices open — the government didn’t urge a broad stay-at-home policy until last week.

Mexico’s approach amounts to a bet, its coronavirus czar acknowledges — “a bet that’s technically sound,” Hugo López-Gatell said in an interview. Authorities are wagering that they can fine-tune their response to the virus, even as it has outwitted health officials in the United States and Europe.

AD

The stakes of that gamble are enormous. Mexico held off on harsh lockdown measures to allow citizens to work for a few more weeks. Nearly 60 percent of the labor force works in the informal sector — as plumbers, gardeners, taco vendors — and they have little or no savings.

Keeping those workers home when it’s not absolutely necessary, López-Gatell said, can cause “frightening damage.”

But if it turns out Mexico waited too long to introduce restrictions, analysts warn, it could suffer a crisis like Italy’s or New York’s — with far fewer resources. Mexico has half as many hospital beds per capita as the United States, and a quarter as many nurses, according to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

“The health system will be overloaded much faster” than in other countries, Eduardo González-Pier, a former Mexican deputy health minister, said last week in a briefing sponsored by the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.

Turmoil in Mexico typically generates fears of spillover in the United States — surges in illegal migration and narcotics, snags in trade. At the moment, though, it is Mexicans who are worrying about crossover problems. On Saturday, governors of three Mexican border states called on President Andrés Manuel López Obrador to tighten controls to limit the arrival of the coronavirus from the United States.

Mexico has extensive experience with infectious diseases; it was the epicenter of the 2009 swine flu pandemic. But unlike many nations, it has not rushed to scale up testing. López-Gatell, a respected epidemiologist with a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University — an institution currently distinguishing itself with a widely cited website tracking the pandemic — acknowledged that Mexico’s official count does not reflect the real number of cases.

AD

“Any country in the world that takes public health seriously knows there’s a portion of the epidemic that’s visible, and a portion that’s not visible,” he said.

How deep is the undercount? Academic studies estimate that there are 10 to 15 times as many common flu cases each year as reported, López-Gatell noted.

But the raw numbers aren’t the point, he maintained. What matters, he said, is identifying when and where the virus starts to grow exponentially. Figuring that out is a bit like conducting a presidential election poll, he said. “You don’t interview 300 million Americans,” he said. “There’s a scientific method to know what is the size” of the sample needed for an accurate survey.

From the start of the outbreak, Mexican authorities tested likely coronavirus carriers — people with symptoms such as fever and dry cough who had recently visited a country with known cases. When a diagnosis was confirmed, officials tried to track and isolate the victim’s contacts.

AD

AD

Authorities also watched for unusual spikes in seasonal flu cases. They didn’t spot any.

On March 24, Mexico declared that the virus had moved to a new phase and was spreading unchecked in communities.

Since then, monitoring stations around the country — in hospitals and primary-care centers — have been testing about 10 percent of suspected coronavirus patients with mild symptoms. Everyone with serious symptoms is tested, said López-Gatell.

“This allows you to have the information to construct estimates,” he said.

In total, Mexico has conducted about 65 tests per million inhabitants. That compares with 2,250 per million in the United States.

Mexico’s approach varies dramatically from the much-praised model of South Korea, which blunted the coronavirus curve through mass testing and aggressive tracking and isolation of victims and their contacts.

AD

AD

Carlos del Rio, an epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, says Mexico has moved too slowly.

“Countries that have done [extensive] testing are doing better than those that don’t,” said del Rio, the former head of the National AIDS Council of Mexico.

Alejandro Macias, Mexico’s former national flu commissioner, said there was not enough early testing to confidently determine when community transmission began. “I don’t think there was enough of a budget,” he said.

Others say testing has been overemphasized.

“It’s as though doing tests will solve the problem. That’s not clear at all,” said Samuel Ponce de León, an infectious-disease specialist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “No one has been able to replicate” South Korea’s success, he said.

Of course, pinpointing when coronavirus cases started to explode was supposed to be only the first step in trying to tame the pandemic. The second was ordering tough measures to “flatten the curve” of illnesses and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed.

AD

AD

Mexico closed down schools and most government offices last week, and urged citizens to stay indoors. By Saturday, though, the movement of people in Mexico City had declined by only 30 percent, López-Gatell told reporters. He pleaded with Mexicans to stay home.

“This is our last chance,” he said.

If Mexicans haven’t gotten the message, it might be partly the fault of the messenger-in-chief. For weeks, even as health authorities called on citizens to refrain from kissing and hugging, López Obrador plunged into crowds of admirers, slapping backs and shaking hands. He has only recently stopped his rallies.

State and local officials have criticized the federal government’s strategy. And there is plenty of skepticism about the case numbers.

AD

But medical experts say there is little doubt there are more cases on the U.S. side of the border. Californians and Texans have more and closer ties with Europe and Asia — regions with big outbreaks — than people living in northern Mexico.

AD

And in a telltale sign of the pandemic’s toll, Mexico has had just 20 deaths so far, compared with more than 2,500 for its northern neighbor.

If there were a dramatically higher number of cases, Ponce de León said, Mexican hospitals would be struggling with the same patient load currently overwhelming some U.S. hospitals. “And we don’t have that,” he said.",['65 tests'],,,

Last weekend, 110,000 people attended the “Vive Latino” music festival in Mexico City, which took place as scheduled despite several confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico’s capital. At the same time, while governments worldwide took drastic measures to slow down the spread of the disease, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, known as AMLO, traveled to the south of Mexico and met with adoring crowds, shaking hands and hugging and kissing supporters. During his daily press conferences, AMLO has insisted that his honesty and moral rectitude protect him from the virus and that the threat of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated. “I have great faith that we will move our dear Mexico forward, that misfortunes and pandemics won’t affect us,” he told reporters at a press conference on Sunday.

The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Mexico may seem low, but it has grown exponentially over the last week, from eight to 118, and the first death from the disease was reported on Wednesday night. Moreover, Mexico has very limited testing capabilities, and the official statistics are not a reliable indicator of the actual number of cases in the country. Although the government’s position is that Mexico is still in “Phase 1” of the pandemic, meaning all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 are people who caught the virus while traveling abroad, most experts agree the virus is already rapidly spreading within Mexico and that the government’s nonchalance about the situation could have disastrous results.

“We need political leaders that are properly advised and understand the gravity of the situation,” said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. “A lot of people in Mexico would die unnecessarily unless the government gets very seriously prepared for this.” Getting seriously prepared means taking drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus, bolstering the hospital system, and helping people cope when the economy grinds to a halt.

The Mexican government has not yet imposed any travel restrictions nor encouraged people to stay home, and it seems very unlikely that the public health system, which suffered drastic budget cuts and shortages last year, will be prepared for the magnitude of the imminent crisis.

“The current guidelines are ‘wash your hands, don’t touch your face, and avoid people who are coughing,’ ” said Gordon McCord, a professor at the School of Global Policy & Strategy at the University of California San Diego. “We know from the experiences of Asia and Italy that if all you do is avoid people who are coughing, you’re going to get an explosion of sick folks in the population, so that’s coming.” Italy, which after China has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths to date, has 340 hospital beds per 100,000 people, which has proved woefully insufficient. Mexico, by comparison, has only 150 hospital beds per 100,000 people, less than half.

Around 5 percent of coronavirus cases become critical, meaning they result in respiratory failure, septic shock, and organ dysfunction. These cases require intensive care to keep the patients alive, which is limited and more expensive. Doctors in Italy, which has an above-average number of intensive care unit beds for European standards (12.5 per 100,000 people), are being forced to decide which patients to keep alive and which ones to let die because there are not enough respirators available for all critical cases. Mexico’s public health care system has 3,000 ICU beds in the entire country. That’s 2.3 beds per 100,000 people.

According to a prominent Mexican epidemiologist, who asked to remain anonymous because of possible hostility from government authorities, Mexico will see a spike in coronavirus cases in the next couple of weeks, and within a month the death toll will begin to rise significantly. “It’s not that Mexico isn’t taking the problem seriously enough. It’s that it did not take it seriously when it should have, and now we are starting to see community spread,” the doctor said. “From my perspective, we have all the conditions for this to turn into a tragedy, similar to Italy, if not worse.”

The government’s nonchalance may be the result of previous experience. In 2009, the Mexican government took severe measures to contain the spread of a new strain of swine flu. Public life was virtually shut down in the capital for several weeks, which took its toll on an already struggling economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Mexico suffered its first recession since 2009 last year, and government officials have indicated they do not want to overreact to the situation out of concern for the country’s economy. In a press conference last week, Hugo López-Gatell, Mexico’s deputy health minister, told reporters that “the [2009] economic loss was directly related, in the most part, to the disruption of tourism, trade and services. … It is so important, with very careful precision, not to take preemptive actions that do not correspond to the magnitude of the risk.”

It is unclear how López-Gatell is assessing the magnitude of the current risk when no significant amount of testing has been done on the population. At the end of last week, the government had tested only around 500 patients. By comparison, South Korea, which has had some of the best results controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, has tested 270,000 people. “I’m sympathetic to the desire of the government not to pull the trigger too early while the number of cases are small,” said McCord. “But if you’re going to do a multiphased approach, there’s one thing you absolutely need if you’re going to get the timing right, and that’s data. Data means mass testing of the population so that you know in real time what’s going on in terms of the epidemiology of this disease.”

López-Gatell announced this week that the government will spend 3.5 billion pesos (roughly $147 million) on tests, protective gear, and other equipment to address the pandemic, and that widespread testing will begin next week. The government’s equipment purchases are based on an estimate of 250,000 cases of the coronavirus over the course of the pandemic and 10,528 people requiring intensive care. That number seems absurdly low, considering that epidemiologists predict around half of the world’s population could get the virus and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s worst-case scenario estimate for the U.S., Mexico’s next-door neighbor, is 65 percent of the population getting infected. Based on the CDC’s projections, Mexico, which has a population of 130 million, should be planning for a worst-case scenario of 84.5 million infections and 4.2 million cases that require intensive care.

Some new measures to curb the spread of the virus will be implemented in the next few days—public schools are going on spring break ahead of schedule at the end of the week, most colleges are switching to online classes, and the country’s biggest concert promoter canceled all of its shows until mid-April—but the government still insists on delaying more significant measures, like travel restrictions and social distancing. “If one begins these measures too early, one extinguishes the will of society to keep them up,” said López-Gatell in a recent press conference. “And although some of those measures might be useful now, they may be even more useful in the future.”

That is simply not true. The more time and opportunity the virus has to spread in the population, the worse the situation is going to be later on. “The more you refrain from the social distancing message now, the longer people feel ‘Let’s go to the restaurants, bars, beaches one last time’—then the higher the spike will be in two or three weeks when this really hits the health system,” said McCord. “And I think everybody senses Mexico is going to be overrun.”

Tijuana Mayor Arturo González said demand for ventilators to the city’s 48 medical device manufacturers has increased by 1,000 percent amid the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.

Mexico has become one of the main suppliers of medical devices to North America in the last 20 years, said Luis de la Calle, a former undersecretary in Mexico’s Ministry of Economy. Most of the ventilators made in Mexico are exported to the U.S., he added.

Ventilator capacity has become a growing concern worldwide, especially as COVID-19 overwhelmed supply in Italy and Spain, forcing doctors to choose who to save and who to let die.

The life-saving machines effectively breathe for patients struggling the hardest against the pneumonia caused by the coronavirus.

Some leaders in Mexico see its production abilities as an opportunity for the Baja California region to be part of the solution to the worldwide coronavirus crisis and recoup some of the economic damage of a shutdown.

Others say Baja California — already an international leader in medical device manufacturing — needs to focus on producing ventilators for its own residents first, after coronavirus cases and deaths have gone up in recent days. The state had 58 confirmed cases and at least four deaths from the disease as of Friday.

Baja California Secretary of Economy Mario Escobedo Carignan said the state will need at least another 1,000 to 1,500 ventilators for its own residents. The majority of the ventilators currently in Baja California are not from local manufacturers.

Three companies in Baja California specifically produce ventilators, but those products are sold around the world, he said. Overall the medical device sector provides 71,000 jobs in Baja California.

Escobedo said Mexico faces unprecedented concerns about the health of its population while confronting the coronavirus, making it necessary for businesses, the government and local leaders to adopt a more nationalistic mindset.

The federal government enacted regulations last week permitting only essential workers to continue operations. Medical device manufacturing is considered essential work, Escobedo said, but there’s a caveat.

“Obviously, all medical device manufacturing is considered essential, but only if you are selling to Mexico,” he said. “The possibility of our workers contracting COVID-19 and risking their lives and the community is only going to be permitted if what they’re doing is essential to Mexico.”

“If what a company is doing is essential to Australia or to New Zealand, we’re going to have to suspend that process,” he continued, “and we’re checking that all medical device companies are selling to Mexico. They don’t have to sell a lot to Mexico, only a percentage, and if they want to expand their production, we will do anything we can to help them expand.”

He noted that Mexico’s president had inquired specifically about Baja California companies that could sell their products to the federal government after local demand was met.

Flavio Olivieri, an economic development specialist and director of the Cali Baja Bi-National Mega-Region, a cross-border business group, said Tijuana manufacturing companies could consider donating a percentage of the ventilators they make for U.S. clients to Mexico’s local and state governments.

“Our focus is tapping into the local capacities of mid-size contract manufacturing companies in Tijuana to produce a low-cost ventilator for regional needs,” said Olivieri.

Companies across California and Baja California, from those that build rockets to those that supply energy, are quickly trying to shift their production capabilities to ventilators.

U.S. medical device firm Hillrom is starting to build ventilators in Tijuana, while Vyaire Medical in Mexicali is boosting production of their ventilator parts, Reuters reported.

San Diego County officials said the collective ventilator capacity in local hospitals, excluding those run by the military, currently stands at 826. In Baja California, there are about 200 of the machines in both the public and private health sectors to serve some 3.3 million residents.

Baja California’s medical device industry has seen demand skyrocket for ventilators and disposable personal protection equipment like gowns, masks and caps, said Jazmin Jimenez, the director of a cluster of medical product manufacturers in Baja California.

“Currently, based on the list of needs we have received for medical devices necessary for the pandemic, I am looking for companies that can develop these devices in Baja California,” said Jimenez, who also worked as an engineer for Thermo Fisher, the company praised by President Donald Trump for ramping up production of coronavirus test kits.

Luis Hernandez, the president of INDEX, or the Association of the Maquiladora and Export Industry in Baja California, said medical device manufacturing companies need help from the United States in encouraging Mexican officials to allow them to continue to expand operations.

He said some companies are meeting too much red tape to expand quickly enough.

“Pick up the phone and call Mexico’s president or the state governor and let them know this is essential work right now,” said Hernandez.

Escobedo said the coronavirus pandemic is going to cause countries and companies around the world to rethink how they operate.

For example, he said most of the medical devices produced in Baja California are shipped to Costa Rica to be sterilized there and then shipped back before being sold. Now, two companies in Baja California are changing their operations to sterilize the products locally.

“We need to save lives and we need to save as many as we can now,” said Escobedo.

At the same time as some medical instrument companies in the United States are teaming up with auto manufacturers to rapidly turn production lines over to the life-saving machines, others are retooling their factories south of the border.

U.S. medical device firm Hillrom is due to start building ventilators in Tijuana, while companies such as Vyaire Medical, Fisher & Paykel and Getinge are either boosting production of auxiliary ventilator parts or other coronavirus-linked products such as masks and protective clothing.

“You can’t flip a switch and turn them on overnight. But the world can’t afford for us to wait six months,” said Howard Karesh, Hillrom spokesman.

Even before the coronavirus pandemic drove demand for medical products through the roof, Mexico was the top source of imported medical devices for the United States. The $17 billion industry is one of Mexico’s biggest export sectors.

That could now be a source of bilateral friction. U.S. reliance on imported medical equipment has been exposed as a strategic weakness during the pandemic, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Monday, while some in Mexico warn that the country may soon need the equipment for itself as cases rise.

Ventilator machines pump oxygen into the lungs of patients with acute respiratory problems, helping to avoid lung failure, which is common with the worst-impacted coronavirus patients. Shortages led to deaths in Italy.

A Mexican medical devices association and Tijuana’s local government both told Reuters that demand for ventilators has jumped 1000% following the coronavirus outbreak, which has caused nearly 4,000 deaths in the United States and more than 43,000 worldwide.

Requests for other coronavirus-related equipment have also soared, with demand for thermostats up 150%, probe covers 300% and medical anti-bacterial solutions 430%, according to Arturo Perez, secretary of economic development for Tijuana.

The industry was on Tuesday included on a Mexican government list of “essential activities,” allowing factories to stay open despite a nationwide shutdown hitting most businesses.

“We... must continue operating because we are going to save lives and mitigate the pandemic,” said Miguel Angel Felix Diaz Alonso, treasurer of a Mexican industry association representing 76 medical manufacturers in Baja California.

The Mexican medical devices industry expanded 9% last year and in 2018 exports totalled $17.1 billion, the association said. Numbers on the volume of ventilators produced were not immediately available.

About a third of all medical equipment in the United States was imported in 2018. Mexico was the top U.S. supplier, accounting for about 17% of total imports, according to a report by Fitch Solutions.

Hillrom, which manufactures ventilators in California, said it was due to increase production capacity of its Life2000 model five-fold on an annualized basis, and would also begin producing the machines in its Tijuana factory.

New Zealand firm Fisher & Paykel Healthcare said it was increasing Mexico production of humidification devices and associated consumables, which are used alongside ventilators.

Integer, a U.S.-listed medical business, said it was increasing production of ventilator and patient monitoring device batteries at least threefold per month in its Tijuana facility.

Hospitals in the United States are also reporting shortages of medical N-95 masks, protective clothing and other equipment.

Stryker, which also has a plant in Tijuana, is expanding global production of defibrillators and patient hygiene, disinfecting and surgical protection products, as well as hospital beds and stretchers.

“We are also exploring expansion into new product areas such as masks and we are working with... (U.S. regulators) to accelerate the approval of essential personal protection equipment,” a company spokeswoman said.

MEXICO TURNS TO CHINA

While its own industry focuses on meeting demand from abroad, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s government has sought to double the domestic healthcare system’s ventilator capacity by ordering 5,000 machines from China.

Three Mexican medical industry executives told Reuters the government had not contacted them to request higher production or to divert ventilators earmarked for export towards Mexican hospitals.

The presidency directed questions on why Mexico was not tapping its domestic industry to the health ministry. The ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Mexico’s approach contrasts with that of many nations, who have enacted wartime mobilization measures to boost production and stop local manufacturers exporting ventilators.

Mexico is several weeks behind the United States in terms of the spread of the coronavirus, with 1,215 confirmed cases and 29 deaths.

But with infection numbers growing and officials warning the health system could be overwhelmed, Lopez Obrador may find himself under pressure to capture more ventilator capacity at home.

Alejandro Macias, Mexico’s former pandemics tsar and chief medical adviser during the 2009 swine flu outbreak, forecast Mexico will need at least 30,000 ventilators during the peak of the crisis.

“If I was the president... I would tell those producers ‘you are in Mexico, we need a share of that production’,” he said.",,"['30,000 ventilators']",,

It’s that it did not take it seriously when it should have, and now we are starting to see community spread,” the doctor said. “From my perspective, we have all the conditions for this to turn into a tragedy, similar to Italy, if not worse.”

The government’s nonchalance may be the result of previous experience. In 2009, the Mexican government took severe measures to contain the spread of a new strain of swine flu. Public life was virtually shut down in the capital for several weeks, which took its toll on an already struggling economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Mexico suffered its first recession since 2009 last year, and government officials have indicated they do not want to overreact to the situation out of concern for the country’s economy. In a press conference last week, Hugo López-Gatell, Mexico’s deputy health minister, told reporters that “the [2009] economic loss was directly related, in the most part, to the disruption of tourism, trade and services. … It is so important, with very careful precision, not to take preemptive actions that do not correspond to the magnitude of the risk.”

It is unclear how López-Gatell is assessing the magnitude of the current risk when no significant amount of testing has been done on the population. At the end of last week, the government had tested only around 500 patients. By comparison, South Korea, which has had some of the best results controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, has tested 270,000 people. “I’m sympathetic to the desire of the government not to pull the trigger too early while the number of cases are small,” said McCord. “But if you’re going to do a multiphased approach, there’s one thing you absolutely need if you’re going to get the timing right, and that’s data. Data means mass testing of the population so that you know in real time what’s going on in terms of the epidemiology of this disease.”

López-Gatell announced this week that the government will spend 3.5 billion pesos (roughly $147 million) on tests, protective gear, and other equipment to address the pandemic, and that widespread testing will begin next week. The government’s equipment purchases are based on an estimate of 250,000 cases of the coronavirus over the course of the pandemic and 10,528 people requiring intensive care. That number seems absurdly low, considering that epidemiologists predict around half of the world’s population could get the virus and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s worst-case scenario estimate for the U.S., Mexico’s next-door neighbor, is 65 percent of the population getting infected. Based on the CDC’s projections, Mexico, which has a population of 130 million, should be planning for a worst-case scenario of 84.5 million infections and 4.2 million cases that require intensive care.

Some new measures to curb the spread of the virus will be implemented in the next few days—public schools are going on spring break ahead of schedule at the end of the week, most colleges are switching to online classes, and the country’s biggest concert promoter canceled all of its shows until mid-April—but the government still insists on delaying more significant measures, like travel restrictions and social distancing. “If one begins these measures too early, one extinguishes the will of society to keep them up,” said López-Gatell in a recent press conference. “And although some of those measures might be useful now, they may be even more useful in the future.”

That is simply not true. The more time and opportunity the virus has to spread in the population, the worse the situation is going to be later on. “The more you refrain from the social distancing message now, the longer people feel ‘Let’s go to the restaurants, bars, beaches one last time’—then the higher the spike will be in two or three weeks when this really hits the health system,” said McCord. “And I think everybody senses Mexico is going to be overrun.”

Mexico,04-06-2020 19:25,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coronavirus-killing-lopez-obrador-big-192551656.html,Coronavirus Is Killing Lopez Obrador’s Big Plans for Mexico,"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Covid-19 has come to Mexico. Factories are shut, planes grounded, beaches empty. Some 2,000 are now infected and dozens dead; cases have been doubling every few days. For weeks, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador blithely ignored the lessons coming out of Italy, Spain and elsewhere. He held rallies, hugged supporters, kissed children and made fun of safety recommendations.

When the federal government did finally announce social distancing measures to begin on March 23, the president wasn’t the one who faced the nation. Instead he sent a Health Ministry undersecretary to urge citizens to stay home. Later the Foreign Minister, not the president, declared a national emergency.

Only now, two weeks later, has the president finally addressed the nation. His speech revealed his limits as a leader, and leaves Mexico unprepared to face the pandemic, rescue the economy or bring the nation together. This failure threatens not just his once sky-high approval ratings, but also the viability of his ambitious economic and political project.

Lopez Obrador’s so-called Fourth Transformation aspires to bring back a paternalistic state even while cutting its size and assuring supporters that austerity will end corruption. Economically, its focus on energy and small farmer is a throw-back, as is its mission to cultivate a clientelistic political coalition based on cash handouts for the young and old, rural and urban.

Unfortunately, as Lopez Obrador has sought to effect that transformation, his policy choices have made Mexico more vulnerable to the pandemic. Mexico was already one of the countries in the OECD least equipped for such a contingency, with just 1.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people, fewer than 10,000 ventilators for its 130 million citizens, and one of the lowest per capita levels of health care spending.

But under his administration, austerity measures have cut millions out of health budgets, and weakened the pandemic rapid response system set up in 2009 in the wake of H1N1 flu outbreak. The recent revamp of the public health system for some 50 million Mexicans has gone poorly. Its hospitals and clinics already struggle to treat diabetes, heart disease, or even keep basic medicines in stock. With tens of thousands more people ill, the system may crumble.

Coronavirus is hitting Mexico’s economy hard as well. Manufacturing (outside of medical equipment) has been brought to a standstill. Factories have been shut to stop the disease’s spread. Orders have disappeared as global consumption plummets. The closing of the U.S. border to non-essential traffic makes sales all the harder.

Tourism has all but ended, staunching the flow of tens of millions of yearly travelers and their more than $200 billion in spending. Remittances are falling, as Mexicans in the U.S. and elsewhere face precarious economic circumstances. The Mexican Treasury predicts the economy could shrink up to 3.9 percent in 2020. International banks are more pessimistic, estimating declines of up to 8 percent.

Public finances are taking a hit. Mexico has never been particularly effective in collecting revenues. Now, as plants and storefronts shutter, revenue from value-added taxes and those on income will diminish even further. With international oil prices in freefall, the state-owned energy company Pemex is near collapse. Last year the finance ministry had to inject $5 billion to keep it afloat. The additional $2.5 billion in tax breaks the president announced won’t be close to enough, as Pemex’s barrels of oil now cost more to extract than they are worth. And this is all before Pemex lays out billions of dollars to build an unprofitable refinery the president refuses to put on hold.

Economists worldwide, from the left and the right, agree that austerity isn’t the answer to the coronavirus shock. Fiscal hawks in nation after nation are on board with extra spending to limit the pandemic’s domestic and global economic damage. Other Latin American nations have announced vast rescue plans, pouring tens of billions of dollars into tax breaks, company loans and grants, social programs, and public works. And Mexico has the added benefit of debt-to-GDP levels of less than 50 percent, giving the government space to borrow.

The crisis has already arrived at Eiju General Hospital, a pink, 10-storey building in central Tokyo, which has reported 140 cases of COVID-19 in the past two weeks. Of those, at least 44 are doctors, nurses and other medical staff.

On a recent weekday, the glass doors of Eiju General were plastered with posters saying the hospital was closed until further notice.

More than 60 patients with the virus are still being treated inside. One person who was transferred to another hospital infected others, according to health officials in Tokyo’s Taito ward.

Japan has only a small fraction of the number of cases reported by its neighbours China and South Korea. Yet scenarios similar to that at Eiju General are playing out across Tokyo, as a dozen doctors and nurses in the city told Reuters there is a shortage of gear and staff even as infections surge.

“We could empty out an entire ward and use it just for corona patients, but that means those patients (with other illnesses) will have to go elsewhere,” said a doctor specialising in infectious diseases at a major hospital in the greater Tokyo area. “If we can’t do that, it will lead to the virus spreading all through the hospital and lead to a collapse of our medical system.”

Official data tell a similar story. Tokyo’s government said that as of Sunday, 951 people with COVID-19 were hospitalised; in a live YouTube address Sunday night, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said there were about 1,000 beds allocated for coronavirus patients in the city.

Even as other countries have locked down borders and ramped up testing, Japan appeared to have side-stepped the kind of mass infections seen elsewhere - an effect some experts say was mostly due to a lack of testing. In the early stages of the epidemic, Japan was also weighing whether to postpone the Summer Olympics, a decision that eventually came in late March.

Since mid-January, Japan has tested 39,446 people, while the United Kingdom has tested 173,784 and South Korea has conducted 443,273 tests, according to data from Oxford University.

Authorities have tried to test and track in a way that avoided overwhelming Japan’s hospitals, said Hitoshi Oshitani, an infectious disease specialist on the government panel shaping the country’s coronavirus policy.

Despite that, the total number of positive cases nationwide nearly doubled in the last seven days to 3,654. Tokyo is now the largest hub for COVID-19 in Japan, with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.

With cases surging, officials said, some who tested positive have had to briefly wait at home or in outpatient sections of hospitals until beds became available. Koike said on Sunday that to ease the burden on medical staff, Tokyo would transfer people with mild symptoms into hotels and other accommodations starting Tuesday.

Hiroshi Nishiura, a Hokkaido University professor and member of a panel advising the government on its coronavirus response, said Eiju General, like many Tokyo hospitals, has no infectious disease department. That meant coronavirus patients were initially treated alongside everyone else, allowing the virus to spread.

“We have not been able to clearly contain the contagion from the first wave,” Nishiura said, referring to Eiju General. A spokesman from the hospital declined to comment on Monday.

On Friday, another hospital in Tokyo said three nurses and one doctor had been infected while treating patients. The next day, Tokyo saw its daily coronavirus cases top 100 for the first time, and on Sunday 143 people tested positive.

A representative for the Tokyo government said Monday that “the medical system remains secure,” adding that Tokyo was continuing to urge residents to avoid all unnecessary outings.

SCRAMBLE FOR BEDS

Contagion is an enormous risk in dense Tokyo, a city of nearly 14 million people. Japan also has one of world’s oldest populations, with nearly a third of the country - 36 million people - older than 65.

According to Japan’s health ministry, there are some 1.5 million hospital beds nationwide, but beds in negative-pressure rooms reserved for infectious diseases excluding tuberculosis have dwindled to just 1,882, with only 145 in Tokyo.

Though people with COVID-19 do not all need such rooms, they still must be kept apart from other patients.

In recent days, Tokyo officials have been scrambling to secure 4,000 beds for coronavirus patients, asking hospitals to free up space in ordinary wards and even offering financial incentives, said one city official with direct knowledge of the planning. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.

“There isn’t that much capacity (of hospital beds) left in Tokyo, so a (medical collapse) is no longer unforeseeable,” said Satoshi Kamayachi, an executive board member of the Japan Medical Association, which has pushed Japan to call for a state of emergency. “The number of patients is clearly rising, so the situation is becoming more urgent.”

JAPAN’S RESPONSE

Even after Japan drew fire for how it handled patients on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, it did little to step up testing and preparations, some critics say.

Tokyo assemblyman Akihiro Suzuki wrote to Koike on Jan. 31, asking her to set up a medical and consultation system for coronavirus cases.

“The response was slow and even now it’s (too) slow,” he said. Suzuki has submitted 10 requests since then asking for a range of measures, from procuring more ventilators to clarifying Tokyo’s policy on treating critical patients.

A representative for the Tokyo metropolitan government said the city had been preparing “specific medical measures” since March 23 for a possible increase in cases, including securing more beds.

A half-dozen nurses working at clinics and mid-sized Tokyo hospitals said that they had been told to reuse masks and were concerned about having enough staff to deal with a surge. Several doctors said they had been told not to discuss the capacity of their hospitals with the media.

Nurses told Reuters they were not sure whether their hospitals had enough advanced personal protective equipment like N95 masks and plastic gowns.

“The other day I saw a news report that a nurse wearing a trash bag as protective gear died in New York and I wondered if that’ll be me in the future,” one nurse in her 30s told Reuters. Like many other medical workers, she declined to be named because she is not allowed to speak to the media.

Kasumi Matsuda, who works for the Japan Federation of Medical Workers’ Unions and was a nurse for 13 years, said many of its 170,000 members had also reported a lack of protective gear.

“I think the system is already beginning to fall apart,” she said.

As the number of cases rises in Tokyo, the Japan Medical Association and Tokyo governor Koike have asked the central government to quickly declare a state of emergency to reduce the rate of infections.

Such a declaration empowers governors to close public facilities and “name and shame” companies that refuse official requests. But it cannot force companies to comply.

Media reports on Monday indicated that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was preparing to declare a state of emergency this week after days of saying such a decision would be premature.

On Friday, a non-profit organisation that offers developmental aid abroad, said it would build a makeshift hospital with 1,200 beds by the end of April in a bayside shopping district of Tokyo.

The beds will be set up under tents in a parking lot of a museum of maritime science, a building shaped like a docked ship.","['443,273 tests']",,,

Nationwide capacity for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test has grown to 7,500 a day, on track to reach 8,000 a day target by the end of the month.

But the number of tests conducted has been on average 1,190 a day over the past month, totaling 32,125, according to health ministry data. That compares with more than the 200,000 tests conducted in South Korea and 80,000 in Italy.

The ministry says it has made it easier for doctors to order the PCR tests, so the figures for the number of tests carried out reflects the discretion of physicians.

“Just because you have capacity, it doesn’t mean that we need to use that capacity fully,” health ministry official Yasuyuki Sahara told a news briefing on Tuesday. “It isn’t necessary to carry out tests on these people who are just simply worried.”

The health ministry’s statement however contrasts with a study by the Japan Medical Association, reported by public broadcaster NHK on Wednesday, that 290 coronavirus tests requested by doctors had been refused by health centers.

The doctor’s organization cited its nationwide poll showing the refusals happened in 26 prefectures in a 20-day period through March 16, NHK said.

Japan has had 868 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 29 related deaths, not including cases from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, according to NHK’s tally on Wednesday morning. An additional death was reported by local media in the afternoon.

The virus has infected more than 180,000 people and killed almost 8,000 globally with the most serious spread now taking place in Europe after China, where the virus originated late last year, brings its epidemic under control.

MEGACITIES

While Japanese doctors have carried out more than 32,000 tests, only 16,484 people have actually been tested, given that many are often tested multiple times.

World Health Organization (WHO) head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said countries need to boost testing. “We have a simple message for all countries: test test test. Test every suspected case,” he said.

Japan’s health ministry has been focusing on clusters of cases, with the biggest around the megacities of Osaka and Tokyo, and in the prefectures of Hyogo, Hokkaido and Aichi.

The ministry’s latest cluster map shows 13 such groupings across the country.

With the rate of testing low, unseen clusters may be “rapidly increasing where containment is failing”, said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute for Population Health at King’s College London.

To increase surveillance without overtaxing hospitals and doctors, Japan should introduce the type of drive-through testing that South Korea has implemented, Shibuya said.

Japanese health authorities have said there is no need for drive-through testing, although NHK reported on Tuesday that health minister Katsunobu Kato said he was open to the idea as a way to keep infected people out of hospital waiting rooms.

The United States and most of Europe have enacted travel bans and put major cities on lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus.

Japan has closed schools and canceled many sporting events, but has refrained from putting firm restrictions on travel, businesses and restaurants.

Sahara said more containment measures may be announced after a meeting on Thursday of infectious diseases experts who have been advising the government.

“We are conducting investigations, collecting data,” Sahara said. “So it isn’t that we are complacent or we are optimistic.”","['32,000 tests', '200,000 tests']",,,

Japan has closed schools and canceled public events, which experts say has helped prevent an explosive spread of the virus. But because testing hasn’t been widespread, some medical experts say the extent of infection is understated, and a surge could yet happen.

That would put more of the country under the strain now being felt in Nagoya, and force a nationwide scramble to shift patients, many of them elderly, to hospitals in areas with capacity.

“If the numbers rise further, we won’t be able to cope, so we will either have to ask nearby prefectures to help, or tell those with lighter symptoms to stay at home,” a prefecture official in Nagoya told Reuters.

Confirmed coronavirus cases in Nagoya, the capital of Aichi prefecture, totaled 98 as of Sunday, the official said, far exceeding the city’s 27 beds at hospitals that meet conditions for patients with the highly contagious disease.

Aichi, home to Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), is Japan’s second-hardest hit prefecture, with 121 confirmed coronavirus cases so far. It has a total of 161 beds capable of handling patients with such a disease. Of those, 105 were in use as of Sunday, the official said.

Elderly people are especially vulnerable to serious effects the virus. Japan has the world’s oldest population, with more than 28% aged 65 or over.

Italy, which has Europe’s oldest population, is facing growing concerns about the ability of its strained health system to cope with a relentless increase in new cases.

“If we allow the epidemic to continue, it’s a matter of time,” said Hokkaido University professor Hiroshi Nishiura when asked if Japan could face a situation similar to Italy’s.

He added that the trajectory of the epidemic was hard to predict.

POTENTIAL SURGE

Japan has been hospitalizing all patients who test positive for the virus, even if symptoms are slight, in line with its law on infectious diseases.

But now, in some areas, patients with lighter symptoms are being asked to isolate at home.

To free up more hospital beds, patients with non-urgent surgery will likely be asked to wait, and others may be discharged earlier than is usual in Japan, experts said.

Hospitals are being asked to prepare plans for transferring patients to places that can treat them, given how the speed of the spread has varied by region, said Takuma Kato, a health ministry official.

Japan’s health ministry has issued guidelines on handling an influx of coronavirus patients based on estimates of what peak numbers might look like.

“Potentially, there will be a surge of new cases if Japan is not successful in containment, which I think will happen,” said Kenji Shibuya, director of the Institute of Population Health, King’s College, London.

“Japan is not yet at the level of what Italy is experiencing in terms of outbreak phase, but that gives us a very important lesson - we have to be prepared,” he said.

The death toll in Italy rose to 1,809 by Sunday after a 25% jump in just 24 hours. The number of cases hit 24,747.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said there were 12,000 beds nationwide that could take serious virus cases and 3,000 respirators, but Shibuya said that didn’t mean there were trained medical staff to handle all of those cases.

A national action plan based on a 2012 law calls for hospitalizing severe cases and treating mild cases at home.

Parliament on Friday revised that law to allow the government to declare a state of emergency to cover the coronavirus. Abe has said conditions didn’t warrant such a declaration yet.

A shortage of cutting-edge equipment to treat the most severe cases also poses a risk, and could force tough decisions about whom to treat if cases rise fast, as in Italy.

For example, a ventilator might be in use for a 90-year-old patient while a seriously ill 30-year-old nurse went without, said Koji Wada, a member of the government advisory panel.

Contagion is an enormous risk in dense Tokyo, a city of nearly 14 million people. Japan also has one of world’s oldest populations, with nearly a third of the country - 36 million people - older than 65.

According to Japan’s health ministry, there are some 1.5 million hospital beds nationwide, but beds in negative-pressure rooms reserved for infectious diseases excluding tuberculosis have dwindled to just 1,882, with only 145 in Tokyo.

Though people with COVID-19 do not all need such rooms, they still must be kept apart from other patients.

In recent days, Tokyo officials have been scrambling to secure 4,000 beds for coronavirus patients, asking hospitals to free up space in ordinary wards and even offering financial incentives, said one city official with direct knowledge of the planning. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.

“There isn’t that much capacity (of hospital beds) left in Tokyo, so a (medical collapse) is no longer unforeseeable,” said Satoshi Kamayachi, an executive board member of the Japan Medical Association, which has pushed Japan to call for a state of emergency. “The number of patients is clearly rising, so the situation is becoming more urgent.”

JAPAN’S RESPONSE

Even after Japan drew fire for how it handled patients on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, it did little to step up testing and preparations, some critics say.

Tokyo assemblyman Akihiro Suzuki wrote to Koike on Jan. 31, asking her to set up a medical and consultation system for coronavirus cases.

“The response was slow and even now it’s (too) slow,” he said. Suzuki has submitted 10 requests since then asking for a range of measures, from procuring more ventilators to clarifying Tokyo’s policy on treating critical patients.

A representative for the Tokyo metropolitan government said the city had been preparing “specific medical measures” since March 23 for a possible increase in cases, including securing more beds.

A half-dozen nurses working at clinics and mid-sized Tokyo hospitals said that they had been told to reuse masks and were concerned about having enough staff to deal with a surge. Several doctors said they had been told not to discuss the capacity of their hospitals with the media.

Nurses told Reuters they were not sure whether their hospitals had enough advanced personal protective equipment like N95 masks and plastic gowns.

“The other day I saw a news report that a nurse wearing a trash bag as protective gear died in New York and I wondered if that’ll be me in the future,” one nurse in her 30s told Reuters. Like many other medical workers, she declined to be named because she is not allowed to speak to the media.

Kasumi Matsuda, who works for the Japan Federation of Medical Workers’ Unions and was a nurse for 13 years, said many of its 170,000 members had also reported a lack of protective gear.

“I think the system is already beginning to fall apart,” she said.

As the number of cases rises in Tokyo, the Japan Medical Association and Tokyo governor Koike have asked the central government to quickly declare a state of emergency to reduce the rate of infections.

Such a declaration empowers governors to close public facilities and “name and shame” companies that refuse official requests. But it cannot force companies to comply.

Media reports on Monday indicated that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was preparing to declare a state of emergency this week after days of saying such a decision would be premature.

On Friday, a non-profit organisation that offers developmental aid abroad, said it would build a makeshift hospital with 1,200 beds by the end of April in a bayside shopping district of Tokyo.

The beds will be set up under tents in a parking lot of a museum of maritime science, a building shaped like a docked ship.","['443,273 tests']",,,
Japan,,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/japan-animal-ventilator-maker-looks-to-boost-output-for-human-coronavirus-patients-2020-04,Japan animal ventilator maker looks to boost output for human coronavirus patients,"KAWAGUCHI, Japan, April 6 (Reuters) - A Japanese medical equipment maker said it has been approached by Japan's government to mass produce its animal ventilators to treat people diagnosed with the new coronavirus, and that other countries have also expressed interest.

Metran Co Chief Executive Kazufuku Nitta said the approach was made late last month and that the United States, Britain and India are among over 30 countries the company is talking to.

Ventilators, which assist patients struggling to breathe, are in short supply in many countries hardest hit by COVID-19, the pneumonia-like disease caused by the coronavirus.

In the United States, medical equipment makers said they would simplify ventilator designs and push other work aside to increase production, while automakers have also offered to make the devices. Elsewhere, Swiss manufacturer Hamilton Medical AG said Britain faces a ""massive shortage"" of ventilators.

Privately held Metran also makes ventilators for humans, but Nitta said its veterinary devices are simpler and so are a tenth of the cost to produce and easier to operate.

""In a pandemic, there won't be enough doctors with expert knowledge on site,"" Nitta told Reuters in a recent interview at Metran's factory in Kawaguchi, north of Tokyo. ""A simple and a safe machine is needed for doctors who are not familiar with the device.""

The number of new coronavirus cases continues to climb in Japan, stoking concern about strain on the nation's healthcare system. More than 3,500 people have tested positive for the virus in Japan - with over 1,000 in Tokyo - and 85 have died, public broadcaster NHK reported.

On Friday, the government ordered regions suffering the most serious outbreaks to save hospital beds for severely ill patients.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told parliament that his government had secured over 8,000 ventilators necessary to treat patients in serious condition.

Metran is considering a system for producing 5,000 to 15,000 animal respirators, Nitta said, without providing a time frame.

He nevertheless expects demand to outpace that, so is also considering licensing the product for overseas firms to manufacture.

The crisis has already arrived at Eiju General Hospital, a pink, 10-storey building in central Tokyo, which has reported 140 cases of COVID-19 in the past two weeks. Of those, at least 44 are doctors, nurses and other medical staff.

On a recent weekday, the glass doors of Eiju General were plastered with posters saying the hospital was closed until further notice.

More than 60 patients with the virus are still being treated inside. One person who was transferred to another hospital infected others, according to health officials in Tokyo’s Taito ward.

Japan has only a small fraction of the number of cases reported by its neighbours China and South Korea. Yet scenarios similar to that at Eiju General are playing out across Tokyo, as a dozen doctors and nurses in the city told Reuters there is a shortage of gear and staff even as infections surge.

“We could empty out an entire ward and use it just for corona patients, but that means those patients (with other illnesses) will have to go elsewhere,” said a doctor specialising in infectious diseases at a major hospital in the greater Tokyo area. “If we can’t do that, it will lead to the virus spreading all through the hospital and lead to a collapse of our medical system.”

Official data tell a similar story. Tokyo’s government said that as of Sunday, 951 people with COVID-19 were hospitalised; in a live YouTube address Sunday night, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said there were about 1,000 beds allocated for coronavirus patients in the city.

Even as other countries have locked down borders and ramped up testing, Japan appeared to have side-stepped the kind of mass infections seen elsewhere - an effect some experts say was mostly due to a lack of testing. In the early stages of the epidemic, Japan was also weighing whether to postpone the Summer Olympics, a decision that eventually came in late March.

Since mid-January, Japan has tested 39,446 people, while the United Kingdom has tested 173,784 and South Korea has conducted 443,273 tests, according to data from Oxford University.

Authorities have tried to test and track in a way that avoided overwhelming Japan’s hospitals, said Hitoshi Oshitani, an infectious disease specialist on the government panel shaping the country’s coronavirus policy.

Despite that, the total number of positive cases nationwide nearly doubled in the last seven days to 3,654. Tokyo is now the largest hub for COVID-19 in Japan, with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.

With cases surging, officials said, some who tested positive have had to briefly wait at home or in outpatient sections of hospitals until beds became available. Koike said on Sunday that to ease the burden on medical staff, Tokyo would transfer people with mild symptoms into hotels and other accommodations starting Tuesday.

Hiroshi Nishiura, a Hokkaido University professor and member of a panel advising the government on its coronavirus response, said Eiju General, like many Tokyo hospitals, has no infectious disease department. That meant coronavirus patients were initially treated alongside everyone else, allowing the virus to spread.

“We have not been able to clearly contain the contagion from the first wave,” Nishiura said, referring to Eiju General. A spokesman from the hospital declined to comment on Monday.

On Friday, another hospital in Tokyo said three nurses and one doctor had been infected while treating patients. The next day, Tokyo saw its daily coronavirus cases top 100 for the first time, and on Sunday 143 people tested positive.

A representative for the Tokyo government said Monday that “the medical system remains secure,” adding that Tokyo was continuing to urge residents to avoid all unnecessary outings.

Ethiopia,04-05-2020 15:40,https://news.yahoo.com/ethiopia-reports-first-coronavirus-death-154040908.html,Ethiopia reports first coronavirus death,"Addis Ababa (AFP) - Ethiopia on Sunday announced the first death of a patient suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, as officials ramped up testing to get a clearer picture of the outbreak there.

""It is my deepest regret to announce the first death of a patient from #COVID19 in Ethiopia,"" Health Minister Lia Tadesse said on Twitter.

The victim was a 60-year-old Ethiopian woman who had spent six days in intensive care, a health ministry statement said.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed also took to Twitter on Sunday to offer his condolences.

Ethiopia, a country of more than 100 million people, confirmed its first case of COVID-19 on March 13 and has recorded just 43 in total -- mostly people who have a history of recent foreign travel.

But testing has been extremely limited.

As of Friday, the country had conducted just 1,222 tests, according to the Ethiopian Public Health Institute.

South Africa, by comparison, has performed tens of thousands of tests.

On Saturday, Ethiopian officials announced they were conducting an additional 647 tests ""as part of strengthening the COVID-19 surveillance"".

The new round of testing targeted health workers, people in the transportation sector who have ""direct contact with passengers"" and ""randomly selected community members"" in Addis Ababa, the capital, and the city of Adama in the Oromia region.

It was intended to help determine whether there has been undetected community transmission, said Dr Adisu Kebede, director of national laboratory capacity building.

""There are also a few cases that we identified that have no travel history and things like that, and from their contacts, you can guess that there is community transmission already,"" Adisu said.

""The WHO recommended 'test, test, test,' so we had to test more people,"" he added.

The country has ""around 23,000"" testing kits available, the vast majority of them donated last month by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma, Adisu said.

It has no rapid testing capacity, and its facilities can currently process no more than 500 tests per day, he said, though the goal is to push that figure to over 1,000 by the end of the month.","['647 tests', '500 tests', '1,222 tests']",,,

Abiy resists lockdown

Ethiopia has closed land borders and schools, freed thousands of prisoners to ease overcrowding, sprayed main streets in the capital with disinfectant and discouraged large gatherings.

Orthodox Christian leaders have encouraged worshippers to pray at home, and police were deployed Sunday to prevent large crowds from descending on one of the capital's main cathedrals.

Orthodox Christians make up 40 percent of the country's population.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, last year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has refrained from imposing the kinds of lockdown seen elsewhere in the region, including in Uganda, Rwanda and Mauritius.

“We can't impose a lockdown like more developed nations, as there are many citizens who don't have homes,"" Abiy said Saturday. ""Even those who have homes have to make ends meet daily.""

The Addis Ababa City Administration has announced that it is temporarily relocating a famous tarding center, the Atikilit Tera market to an open space as of tomorrow April 7.

Atikilit Tera is reputed as the biggest fruits and vegetable markets in the city. Its population is to move to an open space in Jan Meda, city mayor Takele Uma said. The relocation will be implemented with “strict discipline,” he added.

The city authorities have been undertaking series of measures aimed at combating the pandemic which has infected 44 people according to latest figures from Health Ministry.

Ethiopia also recorded first deaths from the disease over the weekend. “The patient was admitted on April 2nd and was under strict medical follow up in the Intensive Care Unit,” Minister Lia Tadesse said of the first victim, a 60-year-old woman. The second victim, a 56-year-old Ethiopian man, had been in ICU for three days.

April 3: Ethiopia cases reach 35, Jack Ma donation distributed

Confirmed cases of the virus have reached 35 in Ethiopia with six new cases being the highest rise since the first case was recorded last month.

Ethiopia’s current tally is relatively low as compared to other countries in the region like Kenya and Rwanda with 122 and 84 respectively. There is a general ban on movement and restriction on public gatherings in the different regional states.

The federal government is leading the virus response. All land borders were closed last week as a containment measure. Cases have been concentrated in Addis Ababa with Oromia and Ahmara region as well as Dire Dawa having recorded cases.

Ethiopia races to bolster ventilator stockpile for coronavirus fight

In four years as a doctor in Ethiopia, Rediet Libanos has used a mechanical ventilator just once: on a patient who suffered a haemorrhagic stroke a few months ago.

But as the country braces for a potential surge in coronavirus, the 28-year-old and many of her colleagues are scrambling to master the workings of the breathing machines, which buy time for critically-ill patients.

During a training this week in Addis Ababa, Rediet and six other doctors got a refresher on how to optimise oxygen volume and pressure for patients whose lungs are failing, practicing first on a green rubber dummy organ before visiting clinics to see ventilators in action.

Though Ethiopia has reported only 29 cases of COVID-19, two of them critical, Rediet expects the country will soon see an onslaught of patients for whom ventilation could mean the difference between life and death.

“I will be on the front lines of that, so I need to be skilled in how to use this machine,” she told AFP.

Yet even as doctors study up on ventilation techniques, Ethiopia’s government — like others in Africa — is confronting a stark ventilator shortage that could hobble its COVID-19 response.

In a country of more than 100 million people, just 54 ventilators — out of around 450 total — had been set aside for COVID-19 patients as of this week, said Yakob Seman, director general of medical services at the health ministry.

By comparison, the US state of New York, the current centre of the pandemic, has said it could need tens of thousands of ventilators for a population of around 20 million.

The Ethiopian health ministry’s own “worst-case scenario” modelling predicts the country will require around 1,500 ventilators for COVID-19 patients by the end of April, Yakob said.

With producers overwhelmed by orders from around the globe, it’s not at all clear how this gap will be bridged, he said.

“I’m really worried about a shortage,” Yakob said. “This is not because of the commitment of the government or lack of will, but because of lack of resources.”

April 1: Tigray is first regional state with COVID -19 lab

Northern Tigray region has become the first regional state in Ethiopia to have a COVID-19 testing lab. This development comes at a time when the state has no confirmed case of the coronavirus pandemic.

Reports indicate that the medical facility is as a result of cooperation between Mekelle University and the Tigray Health Bureau and Tigray Health Research Institute. The lab started work on April 1 in the presence of region’s Vice President Debretsion GhebreMichael.

President of the university noted that the institution had the support of the Ethiopia Public Health Institute, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.

This is the second “lead” since Ethiopia recorded a case last month. Tigray declared a state of emergency and near lockdown days before other states followed suit.

Ethiopia currently has 29 confirmed cases of the virus according to the Ministry of Health. Government has shut all land borders except for essential imports coming in. Cases have been recorded in capital Addis Ababa, Oromia and Amhara regional states and in Dire Dawa, a chartered city.

Barely twenty-four hours after the Islamic Affairs Supreme Council, EIASC, announced cessation to all prayers in mosques, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahdo Church, EOTC, announced a similar measure.

The church’s Holy Synod at a press briefing on Wednesday said as of tomorrow followers of the Church, the largest in Ethiopia, should pray from home and only a limited number of priests should conduct prayers inside churches.

The Holy Synod also decided that all premises of spiritual colleges, Sunday schools and other facilities under EOTC should be designated to serve as isolation centers for COVID19 suspected patients in the event of the possible spread.

The church also donated 3 million birr to contain the virus.

March 31: Al-Amoudi donates towards COVID -19 fight

Ethiopia-born Saudi billionaire, Mohammed Ali Al-Amoudi has made the biggest private donation yet to coronavirus combat in Ethiopia.

He donated the sum of 120 million birr (about $3.6m) to the Addis Ababa city administration on Tuesday. Ethiopia as of midday March 31 had 25 confirmed cases of the virus. Transport has been banned in most parts of the country as government moves to curb spread.

Infections have so far been recorded in the capital Addis Ababa, and in the oromia and Amhara regional states.

Al-Amoudi who is owner of a mining firm Mohammed International Development Research and Organization Cos., MIDROC.

He was arrested on corruption related charges by the Saudi government back in 2017 but was released in early 2019 after the active intervention of Prime Minister Abiya Ahmed Ali.

Amoudi, in his 70s, became a multi-billionaire investing first in construction, agriculture and mining in Ethiopia, where he was born, and then purchasing oil refineries in Morocco and Sweden. Forbes valued his fortune at more than $10 billion in 2016.

March 30: Ethiopian regions ban transport

Four regional states in Ethiopia have imposed a ban on transport as part of coronavirus containment measures. The regions are northern Tigray region (which has declared a state of emergency since last week.), Oromia, Amhara and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region.

Prior to the last weekend, cases were recorded only in Addis Ababa. Oromia recorded two cases on Saturday whiles the first two in Amhara region were recored on Monday.

The federal government led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed closed all land borders even as the national flier, Ethiopian, continues a very scaled down operations of passenger flights concentrating more on freight.

The country currently has 23 confirmed cases out of which two have since been repatriated. Authorities say contact tracing efforts are underway whiles quarantined persons continue to be tested.

March 29: Ethiopia reports cases outside Addis Ababa

Ethiopia at close of day March 29 had reported 21 confirmed cases of COVID-19. An increase of five over the weekend. Three on Saturday and two on Sunday.

Of the three cases on Saturday, one was recorded in the capital Addis Ababa and two in the town of Adama located in the Oromia region. It is the first reported case outside of the capital since the first cases was confirmed earlier this month.

“The other two cases are a 14 year old male and 48 year old female who are members of a family who resides in Adama town. They had history of contact with previously confirmed case. They were under medical follow up since the confirmation of the close contact and tested positive on March 28th 2020,” a statement from the Ministry of Health read in part.

Out of close to 900 tests, Ethiopia has recorded 21 cases, a recovery with two of the confirmed cases having been repatriated to their countries.

Meanwhile more details are emerging from the state of emergency imposed by the Tigray regional state. Among other measures, coffee houses, cafes and juice houses shall be closed.

Anyone who travelled out of Tigray in the past 20 days shall be tested. Anyone who enters Tigray after shall be tested and put under supervision. All house rents shall be halved over the period.

March 26: Tigray region imposes state of emergency

Ethiopia’s northern Tigray regional state on Thursday, March 26, announced a region-wide state of emergency as a means of combating the coronavirus pandemic.

The Tigray Mass Media Agency said the decision was reached a day after the regional state council met and agreed on the decision which has implications on movement and on social activities.

Under the 15-day emergency rule: all travels within the state is banned. There is also a ban on social activities such as weddings and other festivities which could lead of large gatherings. Markets are also to be closed.

More details are expected to be released later. The federal government has closed all land borders as per the decision of an inter-ministerial COVID-19 committee led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

As at March 25, Ethiopia had confirmed 12 cases with all cases in the capital Addis Ababa. The figure is out of about 500 tests overall. It is woefully minimal as compared to South Africa’s over 15,000 tests that have turnd out 704 confirmed cases.

March 22: Ethiopia shuts land borders, impose more restrictions

Ethiopia will deploy the army to halt the movement of people along all borders, with the exception of incoming essential goods to the country, this is one of eight new measures being implemented by the federal government in the wake of the coronavirus spread.

Prime minister Abiy Ahmed on March 23 met with heads of the security sector for deliberations aimed at containment of the pandemic. The group he met today are the security sub-committee of the National Ministerial Committee.

Aside shutting land borders, a series of enforcement measures were announced relating to regulations on large gatherings and social distancing. Public transports are to avoid overcrowding whiles businesses will be checked in line with normal pricing of essentials.

Government offices have been tasked to employ adequate safety measures for employees whiles seeking home options for other employees. The security forces – army and police – are to undertake internal preparations for enforcement of the relevant rules.

March 20: Ethiopian suspends flights to 30 countries

State-affiliated FBC reports that Ethiopian airlines (Ethiopian) has suspended flights to 30 countries due to coronavirus (COVID-19), effective from Friday March 20.

At the beginning of the outbreak, Ethiopian maintained a decision to stick to its China route at a time most African airlines had suspended operations to and from the country. Ethiopia currently has nine confirmed cases and tests are being run on hundreds of suspected cases.

According to journalist Samson Berhane, CEO of the company, Africa’s most profitable and expansive, confirmed that they had made losses of up to $190 million. “We ll probably face the biggest crisis in the history of aviation in Ethiopia,” Tewolde Gebremariam said.

The FBC report adds that Prime Minister Dr Abiy Ahmed had announced that all passengers arriving in Ethiopia from COVID -19 affected countries will be quarantined for 14 days, with all cost to be covered by themselves. Uganda has a similar rule in place.

March 19: Ethiopians must join world not stigmatize others – Minister

Ethiopia’s Health Minister says the coronavirus pandemic was not related to any country or nationality, she said it as a “test against humanity” which required Ethiopians to join the world to defeat.

“#COVID19 is not related to any country or nationality. It is a test against all humanity. We should fight it together and defeat it. I call upon all my fellow Ethiopians to join hands with the world to fight this global challenge,” her post on Twitter read.

It is believed to be connected to a United States Embassy statement that alerted to rising anti-foreigner sentiments in parts of the country.

The embassy cautioned that foreigners were being targeted with the accusation that they were infected with Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus.

In a security alert said as at March 18, the embassy: “continues to receive reports regarding a rise in anti-foreigner sentiment.”

Typical derogatory comments such as “China” and “ferengi” (a reference to foreigners) have been “reportedly coupled with the label ‘corona’, indicating a disparaging view on the link between the outbreak of Covid-19 and foreigners in Ethiopia,” it added.

“Reports indicate that foreigners have been attacked with stones, denied transportation services… being spat on, chased on foot, and been accused of being infected with Covid-19,” the embassy added.

Ethiopia recorded its first case last week of a Japanese national. The cases have risen to six, the sixth being of a British diplomat. Health authorities said they were testing over 900 people for the virus as part of contact tracing efforts connected to confirmed cases.

Across Africa, there is a view that most confirmed cases have been imported largely from Europe. Most index cases were of either European nationals or of Africans with recent travel history to Europe. There are sixteen deaths so far, as at March 19.

U.S. president Donald Trump has been under fire on Twitter for referring to the coronavirus as “The Chinese Virus.” Most people have called the reference racist especially with the WHO cautioning against tagging a global malady with a certain category of people.

March 16: Ethiopia’s COVID -19 rules: Crowd ban, free transport, regulate essentials etc.

Ethiopia confirmed the fifth coronavirus case on Monday (March 16), a day after it had recorded an increase of three in addition to the index case that was recorded last week.

The office of the Prime Minister issued a statement surrounding key measures taken by government to safeguard public safety and orderliness.

The COVID-19 National Ministerial Committee at its second meeting led by PM Abiy agreed on a number of measures aimed at addressing containment and potential spread of the virus.

It announced a 10-point measure that was set to last “for the next two weeks, subject to further assessments,” the statement read. the measures included wide-ranging public bans, social interventions and regulating of economic activities propped up by the pandemic.

Large gatherings including sporting events had been banned whiles small gatherings required clearance from the Health Ministry.

All educational institutions with the exception of higher learning institutions were to be closed.

Religious institutions and places of worship are tasked to limit gatherings

A national hygiene and preventive measures movement launched from federal level to local levels

Government announced allocation of budget for distribution of masks, soap, alcohol solutions and other items in critical locations.

Government buses are to be availed free of charge to help control crowding in public transport. Special buses designated to take public servants to work. Private transporters are also asked to follow suit.

Trade ministry to monitor and act against businesses engaging in price-gouging

Special attention to be paid to the elderly.

Volunteers tasked to compliment government education, prevention efforts.

“The Prime Minister calls upon all to maintain calm and equip themselves with accurate information from the Ministry of Health.

“Citizens are asked to maintain strong hand hygiene and avoid (ing) unnecessary physical contact in line with Ministry of Health guidelines,” the statement concluded.

PM Abiy over the weekend disclosed that he had reached a partnership with Chinese e-commerce founder Jack Ma for an Africa wide supply of key coronavirus materials including masks, testing kits and literature.","['15,000 tests', '900 tests', '500 tests']","['1,500 ventilators', '54 ventilators']",,
Ethiopia,04-06-2020 18:23,https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesia-ranks-among-worlds-worst-in-coronavirus-testing-rate-together-with-ethiopia,"Indonesia ranks among world's worst in coronavirus testing rate, together with Ethiopia, Bangladesh","JAKARTA - Only 36 in every million people are being tested for the coronavirus in Indonesia, making it the fourth worst in testing rate among countries with a 50 million population or above, pandemic data site Worldometer has revealed.

The world's fourth-most populous country of 270 million performed better than only Ethiopia, Nigeria and Bangladesh, according to the site, which has introduced a new feature showing testing rates relative to the respective country's population.

The three worst-preforming are Ethiopia, with 16 tests for every million people, Bangladesh (18), and Nigeria (19). In comparison, South Korea tests 8,996 for every million people, Singapore 6,666, and Malaysia 1,605.

Asked by The Straits Times on Monday (April 6) about Indonesia's very low rate, Mr Achmad Yurianto, a government spokesman for Covid-19 management, said: ""We don't test based on the size of population, but based on contact tracing of positive cases as well as based on the visits to health facilities by people with Covid-19 symptoms.""

He added that Indonesia is also doing rapid tests, but the number of such tests - and the number of any confirmation tests after this procedure - do not add to the Covid-19 national tallies.

He stressed that such rapid tests, which are not as reliable as the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, are used only to help with early ""screening"" of people who may have contracted the virus.

Any close contact who is tested negative using a rapid test kit must redo the procedure after a period of time, while anyone testing positive would have to be confirmed by a PCR test.

Rapid tests are antibody tests, which determines whether a person has developed immunity to the coronavirus. These tests, however, have a limited role in diagnosis, according to experts, as it takes the body four days or longer after infection to produce antibodies, which would be too late for the purpose of quick detection and contact tracing.

Indonesia's ranking among the likes of Ethiopia comes as a surprise as the South-east Asia's largest economy has a GDP that is at least three times larger than any of the three bottom-ranked countries. Indonesia’s GDP per capita, often used as an indicator of a country’s standard of living, is at least double.

Indonesia has a GDP of USD$1.1 trillion (S$ 1.58 trillion), while Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nigeria has a GDP of US$81 billion, US$250 billion, and US$375 billion, respectively.

Indonesia's health ministry has been widely criticised for red tape in bringing in test kits, as well as equipment to read the PCR test samples.

Recent media reports have also pointed out that the ministry's official Covid-19 death toll nationwide, currently at 209, is an understated figure contradicted by separate announcements by local governments in West Java and the Jakarta municipal government, which indicate a higher toll. This has raised questions about the health ministry's transparency and credibility in disclosing data, the local media has reported.

Jakarta, where about half of the national confirmed cases are from, issued a monthly figure on burials in the capital for March at 4,377, well above the monthly average of 2,745 burials last year and 2,774 burials the year before.

On April 2, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said 401 burials were conducted following the Covid-19 protocol. The national tally shows the fatality in Jakarta as only 99.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah is among currencies that have weakened sharply against the US dollar as the coronavirus crisis deepened. The rupiah fell 15 per cent year on year on April 6, while other currencies that have seen sharp falls in the same period include the Mexican peso, which dropped 26 per cent, and the Russian rouble, 19 per cent.

Some of these countries have spent a lot of their foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the currency markets. Experts, however, have argued that uncertainty and a lack of credibility pose the greatest threat to these countries' currency values, and improving transparency in their Covid-19 data and boosting testing rates would be the most effective measures to address their currency depreciation woes.",['16 tests'],,,

Addis Ababa (AFP) - In four years as a doctor in Ethiopia, Rediet Libanos has used a mechanical ventilator just once: on a patient who suffered a haemorrhagic stroke a few months ago.

But as the country braces for a potential surge in coronavirus, the 28-year-old and many of her colleagues are scrambling to master the workings of the breathing machines, which buy time for critically-ill patients.

During a training this week in Addis Ababa, Rediet and six other doctors got a refresher on how to optimise oxygen volume and pressure for patients whose lungs are failing, practicing first on a green rubber dummy organ before visiting clinics to see ventilators in action.

Though Ethiopia has reported only 29 cases of COVID-19, two of them critical, Rediet expects the country will soon see an onslaught of patients for whom ventilation could mean the difference between life and death.

""I will be on the front lines of that, so I need to be skilled in how to use this machine,"" she told AFP.

Yet even as doctors study up on ventilation techniques, Ethiopia's government -- like others in Africa -- is confronting a stark ventilator shortage that could hobble its COVID-19 response.

In a country of more than 100 million people, just 54 ventilators -- out of around 450 total -- had been set aside for COVID-19 patients as of this week, said Yakob Seman, director general of medical services at the health ministry.

By comparison, the US state of New York, the current centre of the pandemic, has said it could need tens of thousands of ventilators for a population of around 20 million.

The Ethiopian health ministry's own ""worst-case scenario"" modelling predicts the country will require around 1,500 ventilators for COVID-19 patients by the end of April, Yakob said.

With producers overwhelmed by orders from around the globe, it's not at all clear how this gap will be bridged, he said.

""I'm really worried about a shortage,"" Yakob said. ""This is not because of the commitment of the government or lack of will, but because of lack of resources.""

- Global supplies scarce -

Ventilator shortages have been well-documented in Italy and New York, and health officials at the African Union stress that the problem is not unique to the continent.

But African shortfalls could be especially acute -- Europe and the United States are already scouring the world market for the precious machines.

The Norwegian Refugee Council reported this week there were just three ventilators in Central African Republic, a country of five million people.

The WHO is advising African countries to ""start thinking about mobilising"" additional ventilators, said Dr Mary Stephen, a technical officer for emergencies at the WHO's regional office in Republic of Congo.

""We do not produce them in Africa, so countries need to start collaborating. Can we start talking with the private sector? Can we start talking to China?"" Stephen said.

""These are actions that need to start happening before we get to that stage where we have a large number of cases.""

Ethiopia's experience shows that sourcing more ventilators is easier said than done.

The government has requested 1,000 ventilators from producers in China but has been told it won't be able to get them all at once and may have to settle for 250 per month, Yakob said.

One procurement agent contracted by the government to find 200 ventilators, who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity, said the process of fulfilling orders had been complicated by coronavirus-related flight restrictions and recent price hikes.

Ventilators once available for around $9,000 (8,300 euros) are going these days for more than $20,000, the agent said.

-'We're definitely worried'-

As Ethiopia's COVID-19 case count slowly increases, officials are assessing how to make do with what they have.

In addition to 450 or so functional ventilators, the health ministry has tallied 197 non-functional ones, and it hopes to bring at least some of those back online, Yakob said.

Yet many ventilators in Ethiopia were donated, meaning health facilities do not have a direct line to manufacturers and struggle to find spare parts to maintain them.

""When you get something by donation, it will not have the right manual, you don't have the right connection with the company, and skill transfer has not been done very well,"" Yakob said.",,"['1,500 ventilators', '200 ventilators', '1,000 ventilators', '54 ventilators']",,

One medical equipment that has assumed star status in the wake of the current pandemic are ventilators. They are basically breathing machines that facilitates breathing in cases of respiratory failures. They buy time for especially chronic sufferers of the coronavirus as medics work on treatment.

The tallies of ventilators per most African nations is worrying low according to experts and officials. In Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous country, doctors were recently given training on the use of ventilators in an Addis Ababa hospital.

The health professionals who received the private sector-led training are convinced that the device will make the difference between life and death when the time comes. Doctor Tihitina Legesse told the media: “I’ll be first in line on this. So I need to be trained in the use of this device.’‘

Ethiopia has over 100 million people, but only 54 respirators out of 450 available have been reserved for coronavirus patients. The Ministry of Health would like to acquire 1,500 more. The government has ordered a thousand devices from China. But global demand is strong. Addis Ababa will have to settle for 250 by April.

Rediet Libanos, another medic said: “In Italy, for example, they’re overwhelmed with patients, very sick patients. They are suffering from shortages of artificial ventilation and they have to decide who has priority. If things continue like this, if people don’t take it seriously, they’ll probably be overwhelmed.”

As of Friday April 3, Ethiopia has officially officially confirmed 35 coronavirus cases with two cases deemed serious.

The ventilator training held this week in Addis Ababa — organised by the American Medical Centre, a private clinic — is an attempt to make sure that whatever machines are available will be used properly, said Dr Nebiyou Asnake, the centre’s medical director.

The centre hopes to train 100 doctors on ventilation by the end of the month, Asnake said.

Since reporting its first COVID-19 case on March 13, Ethiopia has closed land borders and schools, freed thousands of prisoners to ease overcrowding, sprayed main streets in the capital with disinfectant, and discouraged large gatherings.

However Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed lamented this week that “social distancing” guidelines “aren’t being adhered to satisfactorily”.

“We’re definitely worried, but we’re trying our best,” said Dr Tihitina Negesse, who also took part in the training.

“We’re already seeing that in other countries, in Italy for example, they’re being overwhelmed with patients, severely ill patients. They’re having shortages of mechanical ventilators and they’re having to decide who to prioritise. If things continue like this, if people don’t take it seriously, then we’ll probably be overwhelmed.”

April 3: Ethiopia cases reach 35, Jack Ma donation distributed

Confirmed cases of the virus have reached 35 in Ethiopia with six new cases being the highest rise since the first case was recorded last month.

Ethiopia’s current tally is relatively low as compared to other countries in the region like Kenya and Rwanda with 122 and 84 respectively. There is a general ban on movement and restriction on public gatherings in the different regional states.

The federal government is leading the virus response. All land borders were closed last week as a containment measure. Cases have been concentrated in Addis Ababa with Oromia and Ahmara region as well as Dire Dawa having recorded cases.

April 1: Tigray is first regional state with COVID -19 lab

Northern Tigray region has become the first regional state in Ethiopia to have a COVID-19 testing lab. This development comes at a time when the state has no confirmed case of the coronavirus pandemic.

Reports indicate that the medical facility is as a result of cooperation between Mekelle University and the Tigray Health Bureau and Tigray Health Research Institute. The lab started work on April 1 in the presence of region’s Vice President Debretsion GhebreMichael.

President of the university noted that the institution had the support of the Ethiopia Public Health Institute, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.

This is the second “lead” since Ethiopia recorded a case last month. Tigray declared a state of emergency and near lockdown days before other states followed suit.

Ethiopia currently has 29 confirmed cases of the virus according to the Ministry of Health. Government has shut all land borders except for essential imports coming in. Cases have been recorded in capital Addis Ababa, Oromia and Amhara regional states and in Dire Dawa, a chartered city.

March 31: Al-Amoudi donates towards COVID -19 fight

Ethiopia-born Saudi billionaire, Mohammed Ali Al-Amoudi has made the biggest private donation yet to coronavirus combat in Ethiopia.

He donated the sum of 120 million birr (about $3.6m) to the Addis Ababa city administration on Tuesday. Ethiopia as of midday March 31 had 25 confirmed cases of the virus. Transport has been banned in most parts of the country as government moves to curb spread.

Infections have so far been recorded in the capital Addis Ababa, and in the oromia and Amhara regional states.

Al-Amoudi who is owner of a mining firm Mohammed International Development Research and Organization Cos., MIDROC.

He was arrested on corruption related charges by the Saudi government back in 2017 but was released in early 2019 after the active intervention of Prime Minister Abiya Ahmed Ali.

Amoudi, in his 70s, became a multi-billionaire investing first in construction, agriculture and mining in Ethiopia, where he was born, and then purchasing oil refineries in Morocco and Sweden. Forbes valued his fortune at more than $10 billion in 2016.

March 30: Ethiopian regions ban transport

Four regional states in Ethiopia have imposed a ban on transport as part of coronavirus containment measures. The regions are northern Tigray region (which has declared a state of emergency since last week.), Oromia, Amhara and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region.

Prior to the last weekend, cases were recorded only in Addis Ababa. Oromia recorded two cases on Saturday whiles the first two in Amhara region were recored on Monday.

The federal government led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed closed all land borders even as the national flier, Ethiopian, continues a very scaled down operations of passenger flights concentrating more on freight.

The country currently has 23 confirmed cases out of which two have since been repatriated. Authorities say contact tracing efforts are underway whiles quarantined persons continue to be tested.

March 29: Ethiopia reports cases outside Addis Ababa

Ethiopia at close of day March 29 had reported 21 confirmed cases of COVID-19. An increase of five over the weekend. Three on Saturday and two on Sunday.

Of the three cases on Saturday, one was recorded in the capital Addis Ababa and two in the town of Adama located in the Oromia region. It is the first reported case outside of the capital since the first cases was confirmed earlier this month.

“The other two cases are a 14 year old male and 48 year old female who are members of a family who resides in Adama town. They had history of contact with previously confirmed case. They were under medical follow up since the confirmation of the close contact and tested positive on March 28th 2020,” a statement from the Ministry of Health read in part.

Out of close to 900 tests, Ethiopia has recorded 21 cases, a recovery with two of the confirmed cases having been repatriated to their countries.

Meanwhile more details are emerging from the state of emergency imposed by the Tigray regional state. Among other measures, coffee houses, cafes and juice houses shall be closed.

Anyone who travelled out of Tigray in the past 20 days shall be tested. Anyone who enters Tigray after shall be tested and put under supervision. All house rents shall be halved over the period.

March 26: Tigray region imposes state of emergency

Ethiopia’s northern Tigray regional state on Thursday, March 26, announced a region-wide state of emergency as a means of combating the coronavirus pandemic.

Under the 15-day emergency rule: all travels within the state is banned. There is also a ban on social activities such as weddings and other festivities which could lead of large gatherings. Markets are also to be closed.

More details are expected to be released later. The federal government has closed all land borders as per the decision of an inter-ministerial COVID-19 committee led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

As at March 25, Ethiopia had confirmed 12 cases with all cases in the capital Addis Ababa. The figure is out of about 500 tests overall. It is woefully minimal as compared to South Africa’s over 15,000 tests that have turnd out 704 confirmed cases.

March 22: Ethiopia shuts land borders, impose more restrictions

Ethiopia will deploy the army to halt the movement of people along all borders, with the exception of incoming essential goods to the country, this is one of eight new measures being implemented by the federal government in the wake of the coronavirus spread.

March 20: Ethiopian suspends flights to 30 countries

State-affiliated FBC reports that Ethiopian airlines (Ethiopian) has suspended flights to 30 countries due to coronavirus (COVID-19), effective from Friday March 20.

At the beginning of the outbreak, Ethiopian maintained a decision to stick to its China route at a time most African airlines had suspended operations to and from the country. Ethiopia currently has nine confirmed cases and tests are being run on hundreds of suspected cases.

The FBC report adds that Prime Minister Dr Abiy Ahmed had announced that all passengers arriving in Ethiopia from COVID -19 affected countries will be quarantined for 14 days, with all cost to be covered by themselves. Uganda has a similar rule in place.

Night clubs are to remain closed whiles government is set to release a category of prisonser. Specifically inmates who have children, and whose probationary period is drawing to an end plus those in detention for minor crimes, the PM added.

On the subject of religious institutions, Abiy said they had been tasked to take all necessary measures towards the implementation of a robust mechanism to prevent the spread of the virus.

March 19: Ethiopians must join world not stigmatize others – Minister

Ethiopia’s Health Minister says the coronavirus pandemic was not related to any country or nationality, she said it as a “test against humanity” which required Ethiopians to join the world to defeat.

“#COVID19 is not related to any country or nationality. It is a test against all humanity. We should fight it together and defeat it. I call upon all my fellow Ethiopians to join hands with the world to fight this global challenge,” her post on Twitter read.

It is believed to be connected to a United States Embassy statement that alerted to rising anti-foreigner sentiments in parts of the country.

In a security alert said as at March 18, the embassy: “continues to receive reports regarding a rise in anti-foreigner sentiment.”

Ethiopia recorded its first case last week of a Japanese national. The cases have risen to six, the sixth being of a British diplomat. Health authorities said they were testing over 900 people for the virus as part of contact tracing efforts connected to confirmed cases.

Across Africa, there is a view that most confirmed cases have been imported largely from Europe. Most index cases were of either European nationals or of Africans with recent travel history to Europe. There are sixteen deaths so far, as at March 19.

U.S. president Donald Trump has been under fire on Twitter for referring to the coronavirus as “The Chinese Virus.” Most people have called the reference racist especially with the WHO cautioning against tagging a global malady with a certain category of people.

April 3: Ethiopia cases reach 35, Jack Ma donation distributed

Confirmed cases of the virus have reached 35 in Ethiopia with six new cases being the highest rise since the first case was recorded last month.

Ethiopia’s current tally is relatively low as compared to other countries in the region like Kenya and Rwanda with 122 and 84 respectively. There is a general ban on movement and restriction on public gatherings in the different regional states.

The federal government is leading the virus response. All land borders were closed last week as a containment measure. Cases have been concentrated in Addis Ababa with Oromia and Ahmara region as well as Dire Dawa having recorded cases.

Ethiopia races to bolster ventilator stockpile for coronavirus fight

In four years as a doctor in Ethiopia, Rediet Libanos has used a mechanical ventilator just once: on a patient who suffered a haemorrhagic stroke a few months ago.

But as the country braces for a potential surge in coronavirus, the 28-year-old and many of her colleagues are scrambling to master the workings of the breathing machines, which buy time for critically-ill patients.

During a training this week in Addis Ababa, Rediet and six other doctors got a refresher on how to optimise oxygen volume and pressure for patients whose lungs are failing, practicing first on a green rubber dummy organ before visiting clinics to see ventilators in action.

Though Ethiopia has reported only 29 cases of COVID-19, two of them critical, Rediet expects the country will soon see an onslaught of patients for whom ventilation could mean the difference between life and death.

“I will be on the front lines of that, so I need to be skilled in how to use this machine,” she told AFP.

Yet even as doctors study up on ventilation techniques, Ethiopia’s government — like others in Africa — is confronting a stark ventilator shortage that could hobble its COVID-19 response.

In a country of more than 100 million people, just 54 ventilators — out of around 450 total — had been set aside for COVID-19 patients as of this week, said Yakob Seman, director general of medical services at the health ministry.

By comparison, the US state of New York, the current centre of the pandemic, has said it could need tens of thousands of ventilators for a population of around 20 million.

The Ethiopian health ministry’s own “worst-case scenario” modelling predicts the country will require around 1,500 ventilators for COVID-19 patients by the end of April, Yakob said.

With producers overwhelmed by orders from around the globe, it’s not at all clear how this gap will be bridged, he said.

“I’m really worried about a shortage,” Yakob said. “This is not because of the commitment of the government or lack of will, but because of lack of resources.”

April 1: Tigray is first regional state with COVID -19 lab

Northern Tigray region has become the first regional state in Ethiopia to have a COVID-19 testing lab. This development comes at a time when the state has no confirmed case of the coronavirus pandemic.

Reports indicate that the medical facility is as a result of cooperation between Mekelle University and the Tigray Health Bureau and Tigray Health Research Institute. The lab started work on April 1 in the presence of region’s Vice President Debretsion GhebreMichael.

President of the university noted that the institution had the support of the Ethiopia Public Health Institute, the Federal Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education.

This is the second “lead” since Ethiopia recorded a case last month. Tigray declared a state of emergency and near lockdown days before other states followed suit.

Ethiopia currently has 29 confirmed cases of the virus according to the Ministry of Health. Government has shut all land borders except for essential imports coming in. Cases have been recorded in capital Addis Ababa, Oromia and Amhara regional states and in Dire Dawa, a chartered city.

March 19: Ethiopians must join world not stigmatize others – Minister

Ethiopia’s Health Minister says the coronavirus pandemic was not related to any country or nationality, she said it as a “test against humanity” which required Ethiopians to join the world to defeat.

“#COVID19 is not related to any country or nationality. It is a test against all humanity. We should fight it together and defeat it. I call upon all my fellow Ethiopians to join hands with the world to fight this global challenge,” her post on Twitter read.

It is believed to be connected to a United States Embassy statement that alerted to rising anti-foreigner sentiments in parts of the country.

The embassy cautioned that foreigners were being targeted with the accusation that they were infected with Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus.

In a security alert said as at March 18, the embassy: “continues to receive reports regarding a rise in anti-foreigner sentiment.”

Typical derogatory comments such as “China” and “ferengi” (a reference to foreigners) have been “reportedly coupled with the label ‘corona’, indicating a disparaging view on the link between the outbreak of Covid-19 and foreigners in Ethiopia,” it added.

“Reports indicate that foreigners have been attacked with stones, denied transportation services… being spat on, chased on foot, and been accused of being infected with Covid-19,” the embassy added.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines recorded on Tuesday its largest daily increase in coronavirus deaths and infections, as it ramped up testing with the arrival of thousands of kits from abroad and the opening of new laboratories.

Ten more deaths took the toll to 88, while the tally of infections rose to 2,084, with 538 additional cases, said health ministry official Maria Rosario Vergeire.

The ministry has opened new labs and run more than 15,000 tests, a five-fold jump from about 3,000 last week, she said, adding that more hospitals were seeking government approval to function as testing centers.

“We have six more laboratories to conduct tests,” Vergeire said. “We are also conducting contact tracing to find possibly infected persons.”

Philippine hospitals are struggling with a shortage of protective gear, manpower and testing capacity, as are hospitals elsewhere.

The Philippines, the third country after China and Italy to order home quarantine for a large part of its population of 107 million had until recently reported fewer cases than expected, with many deaths.

Authorities had attributed that to a lack of testing kits and lab capacity.

President Rodrigo Duterte has put retired generals among his cabinet in charge of the task force battling the crisis, saying its management requires military-style discipline.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine president has extended by half a month to April 30 a lockdown that requires millions of people in the country’s main northern region to stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.

President Rodrigo Duterte said Monday in a late-night TV speech that the government was desperately looking for more funds for a massive cash and food aid intended to prevent the poor from starving to death. There have been appeals for middle-class families to be given emergency aid too, he said.

“If there’s nothing to eat, a human being can be violent especially if he sees his children without food and he’s driven to tears,” Duterte said, adding he has ordered the finance secretary to “steal, borrow, I don’t care,” just to produce more emergency funds.

The government has targeted 18 million low-income families for economic rescue under the lockdown with a 275-billion-peso ($5 billion) budget in the next two months. Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told foreign correspondents Monday 16.3 billion pesos ($320 million) have been distributed so far.

Duterte demanded that the aid be given more rapidly amid complaints of delays and confusion over who should get it.

The Philippines has reported 3,660 cases of COVID-19 disease, including 163 deaths.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, bringing its totals to 10,331 infections and 192 fatalities.

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said at least 802 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from abroad amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States. Most of these cases have been detected in the past three weeks, inflating the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.

Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Tuesday repeated his public pleas for social distancing and lamented that young people were lining up at clubs and other leisure facilities at risk of becoming “quiet spreaders” of the virus.

While South Korea’s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.

BEIJING. — China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the coronarivus over the past 24 hours and just 32 new cases, all from people who returned from overseas.

Another 12 suspected cases — also all imported — were being kept under observation, along with an additional 30 asymptomatic cases. China now has 1,242 confirmed cases in treatment and 1,033 asymptomatic cases under isolation and monitoring.

The country that gave rise to the global pandemic has recorded 3,331 deaths and 81,740 total cases. Numbers of daily new deaths have been hovering in the single digits for weeks, hitting just one on several occasions.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will brief the U.N. Security Council for the first time on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, behind closed doors.

The U.N.’s most powerful body has come under criticism for not addressing the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease. The council has in the past spoken out on two public health emergencies — HIV/AIDS and Ebola.

The U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved a resolution on April 2 recognizing “the unprecedented effects” of the coronavirus pandemic and calling for “intensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat” the COVID-19 disease. Resolutions of the 193-member world body reflect global opinion but are not legally binding.

Diplomats say the Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, is divided between its 10 members who are elected for two-year terms and some of its five permanent members — the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China.

The elected members have been pressing for a council briefing by Guterres and have circulated a draft resolution on the pandemic. France is drafting a rival text.

Diplomats said the permanent members wanted a summit of their leaders before a council meeting, and were trying to arrange one as late as Monday morning, but that meeting failed to materialize.

The Dominican Republic holds the Security Council presidency this month and its spokesperson informed the media late Monday of Thursday’s closed meeting to hear from the secretary-general.

TORONTO — Manufacturing giant 3M says it has an agreement with the Trump administration that will allow the company to continue to send N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America.

3M says the company has a plan to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the U.S.

President Trump had used his authority under the 1950 Defense Production Act to stop exporting such masks, also known as respirators. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting healthcare workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19, outraged many officials in Canada.

3M issued a statement last week saying that could have “significant humanitarian implications” for healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America. The company had said possible retaliation by other nations could actually lead to fewer of the masks being available in the U.S.

In New York City, nearly 1 in 5 police officers were out sick Monday, many with flu-like symptoms.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD has a “very deep bench” with about 36,000 officers and won’t need to bring in reinforcements from other agencies, and police officials say there is no imminent need to move to 12-hour shifts.

In all, more than 2,220 people working for the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus. One detective and a dozen civilian employees have died from the disease.

President Donald Trump said he was saddened to hear British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken into intensive care as he battles the new coronavirus.

“Americans are all praying for his recovery,” Trump said during a White House press briefing. “He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special, strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”

Trump said he asked two “leading companies” to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help.

He did not specifically identify the companies, but said “we have contacted all of Boris’s doctors and we’ll see what’s going to take place but they are ready to go.”

“When you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.” Trump said.

The USNS Comfort is now being used for COVID-19 patients.

President Trump confirmed that he’d called New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier Monday to let him know that the USNS Comfort can now be used for COVID-19 patients.

“We’re going to let him do it,” said Trump, adding that the ship will will be used for patients from both New York and New Jersey.

“Hopefully that will be very helpful for both states,” he said.

Cuomo had tweeted shortly before Trump’s news conference began that the ship would add 1,000 beds staffed by federal personnel.

“This will provide much-needed relief to our over stressed hospital systems,” he wrote.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is touting the end of a dispute with 3M to supply millions of masks to medical professionals on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.

Trump said that the “3M saga ends very happily. We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M.”

The president said that the company agreed to deliver an additional “55.5 million high-quality facemasks each month.”

Trump had invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to prevent 3M from exporting masks abroad.

It had sparked some fears that other nations would down on the shipment of medical supplies to the US.

PARIS — France’s health minister has reported the country’s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Olivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.

Though some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that “we have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.”

France has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.

The total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.

NEW YORK — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the end of the month, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe.

New York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most impacted state with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized.

But the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as have the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said.

Warning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29.

Cuomo stressed that even if New York has reached the peak, numbers could persist at these levels, which would continue to stress struggling hospitals.

NEW JERSEY — New Jersey’s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 1,000 people, according to data released Monday from the state’s health department.

In the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003.

New Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials.

BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says his state is starting to see hospital admission and death rates that could suggest new infections are slowing.

“We are starting to real signs that these mitigation measures that we put into place weeks ago are starting to bear real results, and we’re hopeful that we’re seeing the beginning of the flattening of the curve,” the Democratic governor said at his daily press briefing, offering a hint of optimism in a state with one of the nation’s highest per capita virus infection rates.

The New Orleans region isn’t expected to run out of ventilators or hospital beds within days, as previously projected.

Edwards cautioned that even if data continues to show that Louisiana has truly turned a corner in battling the outbreak, no one should celebrate by having an Easter crawfish boil or more trips outside of the house.

“The fear is that I’m telling people that and they’re going to say, ‘Oh, the task at hand is accomplished. We can go back to doing whatever it is we normally do,’” Edwards said. “That is exactly the wrong answer.”

Louisiana has nearly 15,000 people with confirmed infections. The state’s death toll is at least 512.

South Carolina’s governor has added criminal penalties to his orders demanding people stay home unless going to work or the grocery store to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

Gov. Henry McMaster said people can call it a “stay-at-home” order if they like. South Carolina had been the final state east of the Mississippi to not have that specific order.

South Carolina has closed almost all stores that don’t sell medicine, food, home improvement supplies, liquor or guns and banned gathering of three or more people. Anyone violating the governor’s social distancing orders can be ticketed for a misdemeanor and face a $100 fine or 30 days in jail.

McMaster also says he has not been tested for COVID-19. The governor says he has followed protocol that says only test people with symptoms.

At 72, McMaster is the oldest governor in South Carolina’s 350-year history as an English colony and state.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that because of the coronavirus outbreak schools will remain physically closed for the remainder of the school year and that the state’s more than 1.2 million public and private K-12 students will continue distance learning until the end of June.

Washington state had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

Schools have been shut statewide since March 17 and were originally scheduled to reopen April 27.

Now, that closure is extended until midnight June 19 — when the spring term ends — and schools are encouraged to continue to provide distance learning. The order also asks schools to start planning for a potential expansion of the order into the summer and fall.

Under the order, some in-person and on-site services such as meetings with seniors to help finish up final projects and tutoring support is allowed only if social distancing and proper hygiene practices are followed.

Last week, Inslee extended orders to keep non-essential businesses closed and most of the state’s residents home through May 4, saying that social distancing measures must remain in place an additional month in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

RICHMOND, Va. — Eight more residents of a Virginia long-term care facility who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll amid the outbreak to 28, the facility’s administrator said Monday.

Deaths at the Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County have continued to mount since health officials tested every resident last week because of the scope of the outbreak. That testing showed roughly two-thirds of the residents had the virus.

Thirty-four residents were experiencing symptoms ranging from moderate to mild, and 54 of the residents who tested positive were showing no sign of being ill, the statement said.

Across Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health reported nearly 2,900 confirmed cases and 54 deaths Monday, figures that state health commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said at a news conference were “almost definitely an underestimate” because of a lack of widespread testing.

LONDON — The World Health Organization’s emergencies chief said countries looking to exit their lockdown strategies need to use a “calibrated, step-wise approach” that does not release all the restrictions at once.

Dr. Mike Ryan said Monday that the lockdowns seen in many countries involve shutdowns of schools, workplaces, and social gatherings in venues such as public places and parks.

“It probably would be a bad idea to lift all the lockdown restrictions (at once),” Ryan said, noting that countries shouldn’t be looking to transition out of a shutdown without having a plan in place to keep the spread of COVID-19 to manageable levels.

“The lockdown is pushing the disease down. Once you raise the lockdown, you have to have an alternative method to suppress the infection,” Ryan said, explaining countries should have systems in place to detect cases, track contacts, quarantine suspect cases and test widely for the disease.

TORONTO — The premier of Canada’s most populous province says U.S. officials have stopped 3 million masks from getting to Ontario from manufacturing giant 3M but he says 500,000 of them are being released Monday.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says getting masks across the U.S. border is difficult after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks.

Ford says he’s hopeful Canada will get an exemption and says he feels better about that after speaking with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ford says he’s grateful for anything he can from the U.S. after delays in global shipments and recent restrictions at the U.S. border have left Ontario with about a one-week supply of critical protective equipment for health care workers.

Canadian health care workers — like those in the U.S. — are in dire need of the masks that provide more protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker began his daily briefing with a response to President Donald Trump’s poor assessment of his performance.

The Democratic governor again went over what the state had received from the national stockpile and what the state had procured on its own.

As an example, he noted that the federal government had supplied 368,000 N95 masks and 693,000 gloves, while the state had procured 10 million N95 masks and 19 million gloves.

At the same time, Pritzker said the state’s “10-day burn rate for PPE” is 1.5 million N95 masks and 25 million gloves.

“To anyone who wants a response to some of the blame-shifting coming out of the White House, all I have to say is, look at the numbers,” Pritzker said.

ATLANTA — Motorists lined up in rows of cars at a mass drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in Atlanta.

The state of Georgia is partnering with CVS Health in launching rapid testing Monday at a parking deck on Georgia Tech’s midtown Atlanta campus. Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan recently. Georgia has recorded more than 200 virus-linked deaths and more than 1,300 hospitalizations.

Total infections statewide exceed 7,000 and Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, leads the state with nearly 1,000 cases.

Experts say they hope more testing will give a better sense of how widespread the coronavirus is in Georgia.

“Roll your window up, roll your window up!” a police officer yelled at drivers as they approached the first of at least two checkpoints. Dozens of drivers pressed their photo IDs and cellphones against their car windows to show their appointment confirmations. Cars were then directed to another area where testing was being done.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A West Virginia judge in the county with the state’s highest coronavirus caseload has approved strapping ankle monitors to people who test positive but refuse to quarantine. The Monday order allows Kanawha County sheriffs to use the GPS bracelets if someone with the virus ignores an isolation order.

It wasn’t immediately clear how many people violated the mandates, though one local official put the number at “a few.” Officials say at least 345 people statewide have the virus with four reported deaths.

Kanawha County, where the state capital of Charleston is located, has the most positive cases in the state with 56.

Eleven residents of a central Indiana nursing home have died from COVID-19, Indiana Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said Monday.

In addition to the 11 at the Bethany Pointe Health Campus in Anderson, three workers there have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition, Box said during a state news briefing on the pandemic.

The state is helping to transfer residents there without COVID-19 symptoms to another skilled nursing home, Box said.

She said an outbreak in a nursing home had been her biggest fear from the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is a heartbreaking situation and illustrates what a brutal toll the COVID-19 can take on our most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, this will not be the last outbreak of this kind,” Box said.

MIAMI — Dozens of Americans aboard a cruise ship that recently docked in Miami with coronavirus cases are still waiting to disembark because of new federal rules requiring cruise companies to bring them directly home to avoid more infections.

Two passengers died before the Coral Princess ship docked Saturday in Miami and a third died at a hospital. At least 17 passengers have been taken to hospitals. The Miami-Dade mayor said many foreign passengers have disembarked and been taken to the Miami airport where charter planes were ready to fly them abroad. But many of the 250 Americans on board continued to wait, two days after docking.

WARSAW, Poland — Polish lawmakers have voted to conduct the country’s forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting because of the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.

Parliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament late Monday require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking re-election.

Time was an issue for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled — before the pandemic hit — for May 10.

Accelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.

GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization on Monday denounced “racist remarks” by two French scientists for suggesting coronavirus vaccine testing should be carried out in Africa.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian who is the first WHO director-general from Africa, said decried “a hangover from a colonial mentality” at a time when he has urged “solidarity” among countries.

He was alluding to comments on a French news program Wednesday that prompted outrage. Dr. Jean-Paul Mira of Paris’ respected Cochin Hospital floated the prospect of carrying out vaccine tests in Africa.

“If I can be provocative,” Mira said on LCI television, “Shouldn’t we do this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatment, no resuscitation?”

The idea drew agreement from another guest, microbiologist Camille Locht from the INSERM medical research institute.

Tedros retorted at a news conference Monday: “Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.”

“The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop and WHO will not allow this to happen,” he said. “It was a disgrace, actually, and appalling to hear during the 21st century from scientists that kind of remark.”

Mira has apologized for the remarks.

ROME — Italy’s day-to-day increase in new COVID-19 cases has dipped again.

The nearly 3,600 new cases that authorities announced on Monday were the lowest day-to-day increase in 20 days. Another number boosting hopes in Italy’s medical community was a small drop, for the third straight day, in the number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections nationwide.

“Substantially, the data confirms the trend” of a slowing of new cases and “gives comfort that the measures of containment against the viral infection are effective,’ said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pneumologist with Rome’s Gemelli Hospital.

Italy now has at least 132,547 confirmed cases, putting it just behind Spain in total known cases. There were 636 deaths in Italy since Sunday, up from 525 a day earlier. But Richeldi said that overall, a downward trend in deaths was holding, showing a decrease of 20 percent compared to a week earlier.

On Monday, Italy marks a month under national lockdown aimed at slowing contagion with the virus.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine received $1.2 million of aid from the United States amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, Ukraine’s president said Monday.

“Grateful to the U.S. for allocating $1.2 million to Ukraine to combat COVID-19,” Zelenskiy said in a tweet after a phone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The aid comes as the outbreak is taking a toll on Ukraine’s economy, with the state budget deficit tripling and incomes plummeting. Ukraine, where 1,319 coronavirus cases have been registered so far, has been in lockdown since March, with the borders closed and the vast majority of businesses not operating.

The country’s government hopes to get a $8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to keep the economy afloat.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia’s government has approved a plan to limit movement across the country over Easter in efforts to contain the coronavirus.

The restrictions will be in place from Wednesday till the end of Easter Monday.

People will only be allowed to travel to work, do essential shopping or visit doctors. Only family members can stay together for any outdoor activities that will be restricted to take place only within one county.

Slovakia is a Roman Catholic stronghold in central and eastern Europe. The government previously banned public gatherings, including religious services.

The government also approved a renewal of border checks with all neighboring countries between Wednesday and April 17.

Slovakia has 534 people infected, two have died.

LONDON — A host of international stars including Chris Martin, Alanis Morissette, John Legend, Billie Eilish, Lang Lang, Elton John and Andrea Bocelli will perform in a live concert on April 18 to raise funds for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

During a press briefing on Monday, Lady Gaga announced she too would be performing in the concert, calling the coronavirus pandemic “a catastrophe” and said she was praying for all those who were sick.

She made her remarks while wearing thick black-rimmed glasses and a sober plaid tweed blazer over a low-cut top.

“My heart is very achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don’t infect their family,” she said. “We all salute you.”

“I would also like to send my prayers to people who are losing their jobs and are having a hard time feeding themselves and their children,” Lady Gaga said.

She added that in the past week, she and others have raised $35 million for buying much-needed protective gear for health workers, improving lab capacities and further research and development into possible drugs and vaccines to treat the new coronavirus.

In the Philippines, Congress granted President Rodrigo Duterte special temporary powers on Tuesday to manage the COVID-19 crisis that continues to surge in the country of 110 million people.

To date, there are 552 confirmed cases, and 35 deaths.

The measure granting Duterte the new powers was the first to be approved by Philippine lawmakers using Zoom, the remote teleconferencing service, and puts the country under a ""state of national emergency.""

However, Duterte failed to win approval to take over private companies and utilities, authority he had sought.

The president has been locked in battle with private concessionaires who supply water to Metro Manila, accusing them of over-charging and under-performing, and repeatedly threatening to put water under government control.

Duterte's new powers extend to the narrower sectors of hospitals and public transportation. He can direct private hospitals and medical facilities to house health care workers and serve as quarantine centers, and take over public transport operations to ferry front-line workers.

But even these measures have drawn criticism.

""No to emergency powers. The existing powers are already being abused,"" University of the Philippines law professor Jay Batongbacal said in a Facebook post, the South China Morning Post reported.

Duterte has jailed critics, harassed journalists and waged a controversial drug war, exposing him to charges of autocratic rule. Rights advocates fear the new powers will make it dangerous for local governments to express dissent over how best to combat the virus.

Fifty million Filipinos meanwhile remain under lockdown since Duterte ordered half the population to stay home last week. The main island of Luzon is a web of checkpoints to ensure people stay put.

The new law also gives Duterte the authority to reallocate items in the 2020 national budget for projects that would fight the spread of COVID-19. Under a $5 billion emergency fund, some 18 million low-income households would receive assistance.

The package also helps equip hospitals and bolster testing.

Any accurate measurement of the coronavirus in the Philippines has been severely constrained by a chronic shortage of test kits. As of Tuesday, only 1,793 individuals have been tested nationwide.

Last week, the Philippine Health Department said it has only 2,000 kits left. The Chinese Embassy in Manila said it will donate 100,000 test kits. Singapore contributed diagnostic kits on Tuesday that can perform 3,000 tests.

One bone of contention: who should be tested. Reports that VIPs — including senators, other officials and their relatives — were tested ahead of ordinary citizens have generated predictable scorn.","['3,000 tests', '100,000 test kits']",,,

Dubai: Authorities in the Philippines have approved on Friday the use of a COVID-19 testing kit developed by Filipino scientists following the completion of its field validation test on April 1, Tuesday.

The Food and Drug Administration Philippines (FDA), was expected to issue the Certificate of Product Registration (CPR) for GenAmplify Corona Virus 2019 (COVID-19) rRT PCR Detection Kit on Friday, April 3.

A green light for the rollout of the local test kit, which costs about one-sixth compared to imported kits, was expected on Saturday, April 4, according to the University of the Philippines (UP), in a Facebook post.

RT-PCR stands for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, a gene based test for coronavirus marker that's more reliable compared to quick tests. By definition, RT-PCR tests also yields less ""false negative"" results that characterise available rapid test kits that only look for the presence of antibodies in human blood.

The Filipino-developed kit has also been dubbed as ""cheaper, quicker.""

""The test kits are expected to be cheaper and quicker in delivering results compared to foreign counterparts,"" a post by the UP Student Regent states.

“A number of testing kits, which can do up to 26,000 tests, will be distributed for field implementation from April 4 to 25. Currently in production are testing kits that can accommodate up to 120,000 tests,"" it added.

COST The locally-developed GenAmplify test kit will likely cost around ₱1,320 per test ($26), whereas imported made kits cost about ₱8,500 ($167) per test.

The field implementation is funded by Philippines' Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and the University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH) Project.

""We urge everyone to unite in calling for the ensured conduct of mass testing and for the national government to truly support this project,"" the post added.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The DOST’s average budget is ₱20 billion a year ($394 million), including the funding for 13 science high school campuses spread across the country to develop young scientists.



That represents less than 1 per cent (0.56 per cent) of the trillions of pesos Congress passes every year as national budget.



Despite limited financial support, Filipino scientists and researchers continue to attain breakthroughs — but many scientists, trained using Filipino taxpayers money — end up working for by Western pharma giants, resulting in third-world taxpayers subsidising the training and education of big pharma experts.



The detection kit is expected to aid Filipino frontliners in confirming positive cases of the virus.

A team of scientists from the Philippine Genome Center and the University of the Philippines Manila’s National Institutes of Health developed the GenAmplify COVID-19 rRT-PCR detection kit.

It was the same team that developed the “Lab-in-a-Mug” test kits for dengue.

Leading the core team of 15 members was “the conductor of the symphony”, according to a CNN report.

His research is geared towards “developing low-cost technologies for the control of infectious diseases in the Philippines and the generation of new knowledge to find sustainable and equitable solutions to disease of poverty.""

Dr. Destura believes that it is his and his colleagues’ responsibility to assist the efforts of the government in providing technology to help our nation, as well as develop technologies to aid in the labor of our frontliners in times of crisis such as the COVID-19 outbreak.

In January, immediately after scientists from China released the whole genome sequence of the virus and disseminated the information to scientists in other countries, the team started developing the test kit.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine president has extended by half a month to April 30 a lockdown that requires millions of people in the country’s main northern region to stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.

President Rodrigo Duterte said Monday in a late-night TV speech that the government was desperately looking for more funds for a massive cash and food aid intended to prevent the poor from starving to death. There have been appeals for middle-class families to be given emergency aid too, he said.

“If there’s nothing to eat, a human being can be violent especially if he sees his children without food and he’s driven to tears,” Duterte said, adding he has ordered the finance secretary to “steal, borrow, I don’t care,” just to produce more emergency funds.

The government has targeted 18 million low-income families for economic rescue under the lockdown with a 275-billion-peso ($5 billion) budget in the next two months. Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told foreign correspondents Monday 16.3 billion pesos ($320 million) have been distributed so far.

Duterte demanded that the aid be given more rapidly amid complaints of delays and confusion over who should get it.

The Philippines has reported 3,660 cases of COVID-19 disease, including 163 deaths.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, bringing its totals to 10,331 infections and 192 fatalities.

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said at least 802 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from abroad amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States. Most of these cases have been detected in the past three weeks, inflating the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.

Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Tuesday repeated his public pleas for social distancing and lamented that young people were lining up at clubs and other leisure facilities at risk of becoming “quiet spreaders” of the virus.

While South Korea’s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.

BEIJING. — China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the coronarivus over the past 24 hours and just 32 new cases, all from people who returned from overseas.

Another 12 suspected cases — also all imported — were being kept under observation, along with an additional 30 asymptomatic cases. China now has 1,242 confirmed cases in treatment and 1,033 asymptomatic cases under isolation and monitoring.

The country that gave rise to the global pandemic has recorded 3,331 deaths and 81,740 total cases. Numbers of daily new deaths have been hovering in the single digits for weeks, hitting just one on several occasions.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will brief the U.N. Security Council for the first time on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, behind closed doors.

The U.N.’s most powerful body has come under criticism for not addressing the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease. The council has in the past spoken out on two public health emergencies — HIV/AIDS and Ebola.

The U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved a resolution on April 2 recognizing “the unprecedented effects” of the coronavirus pandemic and calling for “intensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat” the COVID-19 disease. Resolutions of the 193-member world body reflect global opinion but are not legally binding.

Diplomats say the Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, is divided between its 10 members who are elected for two-year terms and some of its five permanent members — the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China.

The elected members have been pressing for a council briefing by Guterres and have circulated a draft resolution on the pandemic. France is drafting a rival text.

Diplomats said the permanent members wanted a summit of their leaders before a council meeting, and were trying to arrange one as late as Monday morning, but that meeting failed to materialize.

The Dominican Republic holds the Security Council presidency this month and its spokesperson informed the media late Monday of Thursday’s closed meeting to hear from the secretary-general.

TORONTO — Manufacturing giant 3M says it has an agreement with the Trump administration that will allow the company to continue to send N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America.

3M says the company has a plan to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the U.S.

President Trump had used his authority under the 1950 Defense Production Act to stop exporting such masks, also known as respirators. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting healthcare workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19, outraged many officials in Canada.

3M issued a statement last week saying that could have “significant humanitarian implications” for healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America. The company had said possible retaliation by other nations could actually lead to fewer of the masks being available in the U.S.

In New York City, nearly 1 in 5 police officers were out sick Monday, many with flu-like symptoms.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD has a “very deep bench” with about 36,000 officers and won’t need to bring in reinforcements from other agencies, and police officials say there is no imminent need to move to 12-hour shifts.

In all, more than 2,220 people working for the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus. One detective and a dozen civilian employees have died from the disease.

President Donald Trump said he was saddened to hear British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken into intensive care as he battles the new coronavirus.

“Americans are all praying for his recovery,” Trump said during a White House press briefing. “He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special, strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”

Trump said he asked two “leading companies” to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help.

He did not specifically identify the companies, but said “we have contacted all of Boris’s doctors and we’ll see what’s going to take place but they are ready to go.”

“When you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.” Trump said.

The USNS Comfort is now being used for COVID-19 patients.

President Trump confirmed that he’d called New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier Monday to let him know that the USNS Comfort can now be used for COVID-19 patients.

“We’re going to let him do it,” said Trump, adding that the ship will will be used for patients from both New York and New Jersey.

“Hopefully that will be very helpful for both states,” he said.

Cuomo had tweeted shortly before Trump’s news conference began that the ship would add 1,000 beds staffed by federal personnel.

“This will provide much-needed relief to our over stressed hospital systems,” he wrote.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is touting the end of a dispute with 3M to supply millions of masks to medical professionals on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.

Trump said that the “3M saga ends very happily. We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M.”

The president said that the company agreed to deliver an additional “55.5 million high-quality facemasks each month.”

Trump had invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to prevent 3M from exporting masks abroad.

It had sparked some fears that other nations would down on the shipment of medical supplies to the US.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.

Johnson’s office says Johnson is conscious and does not require ventilation at the moment.

Johnson was admitted to St. Thomas’ Hospital late Sunday, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.

Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him.

PARIS — France’s health minister has reported the country’s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Olivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.

Though some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that “we have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.”

France has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.

The total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.

NEW YORK — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the end of the month, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe.

New York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most impacted state with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized.

But the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as have the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said.

Warning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29.

Cuomo stressed that even if New York has reached the peak, numbers could persist at these levels, which would continue to stress struggling hospitals.

___

NEW JERSEY — New Jersey’s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 1,000 people, according to data released Monday from the state’s health department.

In the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003.

New Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials.

Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties in suburban New York have seen the most cases.

BATON ROUGE, Louisiana — Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says his state is starting to see hospital admission and death rates that could suggest new infections are slowing.

“We are starting to real signs that these mitigation measures that we put into place weeks ago are starting to bear real results, and we’re hopeful that we’re seeing the beginning of the flattening of the curve,” the Democratic governor said at his daily press briefing, offering a hint of optimism in a state with one of the nation’s highest per capita virus infection rates.

The New Orleans region isn’t expected to run out of ventilators or hospital beds within days, as previously projected.

Edwards cautioned that even if data continues to show that Louisiana has truly turned a corner in battling the outbreak, no one should celebrate by having an Easter crawfish boil or more trips outside of the house.

“The fear is that I’m telling people that and they’re going to say, ‘Oh, the task at hand is accomplished. We can go back to doing whatever it is we normally do,’” Edwards said. “That is exactly the wrong answer.”

Louisiana has nearly 15,000 people with confirmed infections. The state’s death toll is at least 512.

South Carolina’s governor has added criminal penalties to his orders demanding people stay home unless going to work or the grocery store to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

Gov. Henry McMaster said people can call it a “stay-at-home” order if they like. South Carolina had been the final state east of the Mississippi to not have that specific order.

South Carolina has closed almost all stores that don’t sell medicine, food, home improvement supplies, liquor or guns and banned gathering of three or more people. Anyone violating the governor’s social distancing orders can be ticketed for a misdemeanor and face a $100 fine or 30 days in jail.

McMaster also says he has not been tested for COVID-19. The governor says he has followed protocol that says only test people with symptoms.

At 72, McMaster is the oldest governor in South Carolina’s 350-year history as an English colony and state.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that because of the coronavirus outbreak schools will remain physically closed for the remainder of the school year and that the state’s more than 1.2 million public and private K-12 students will continue distance learning until the end of June.

Washington state had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

Schools have been shut statewide since March 17 and were originally scheduled to reopen April 27.

Now, that closure is extended until midnight June 19 — when the spring term ends — and schools are encouraged to continue to provide distance learning. The order also asks schools to start planning for a potential expansion of the order into the summer and fall.

Under the order, some in-person and on-site services such as meetings with seniors to help finish up final projects and tutoring support is allowed only if social distancing and proper hygiene practices are followed.

Last week, Inslee extended orders to keep non-essential businesses closed and most of the state’s residents home through May 4, saying that social distancing measures must remain in place an additional month in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

RICHMOND, Va. — Eight more residents of a Virginia long-term care facility who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll amid the outbreak to 28, the facility’s administrator said Monday.

Deaths at the Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County have continued to mount since health officials tested every resident last week because of the scope of the outbreak. That testing showed roughly two-thirds of the residents had the virus.

Thirty-four residents were experiencing symptoms ranging from moderate to mild, and 54 of the residents who tested positive were showing no sign of being ill, the statement said.

Across Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health reported nearly 2,900 confirmed cases and 54 deaths Monday, figures that state health commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said at a news conference were “almost definitely an underestimate” because of a lack of widespread testing.

LONDON — The World Health Organization’s emergencies chief said countries looking to exit their lockdown strategies need to use a “calibrated, step-wise approach” that does not release all the restrictions at once.

Dr. Mike Ryan said Monday that the lockdowns seen in many countries involve shutdowns of schools, workplaces, and social gatherings in venues such as public places and parks.

“It probably would be a bad idea to lift all the lockdown restrictions (at once),” Ryan said, noting that countries shouldn’t be looking to transition out of a shutdown without having a plan in place to keep the spread of COVID-19 to manageable levels.

“The lockdown is pushing the disease down. Once you raise the lockdown, you have to have an alternative method to suppress the infection,” Ryan said, explaining countries should have systems in place to detect cases, track contacts, quarantine suspect cases and test widely for the disease.

TORONTO — The premier of Canada’s most populous province says U.S. officials have stopped 3 million masks from getting to Ontario from manufacturing giant 3M but he says 500,000 of them are being released Monday.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says getting masks across the U.S. border is difficult after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks.

Ford says he’s hopeful Canada will get an exemption and says he feels better about that after speaking with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ford says he’s grateful for anything he can from the U.S. after delays in global shipments and recent restrictions at the U.S. border have left Ontario with about a one-week supply of critical protective equipment for health care workers.

Canadian health care workers — like those in the U.S. — are in dire need of the masks that provide more protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker began his daily briefing with a response to President Donald Trump’s poor assessment of his performance.

The Democratic governor again went over what the state had received from the national stockpile and what the state had procured on its own.

As an example, he noted that the federal government had supplied 368,000 N95 masks and 693,000 gloves, while the state had procured 10 million N95 masks and 19 million gloves.

At the same time, Pritzker said the state’s “10-day burn rate for PPE” is 1.5 million N95 masks and 25 million gloves.

“To anyone who wants a response to some of the blame-shifting coming out of the White House, all I have to say is, look at the numbers,” Pritzker said.

ATLANTA — Motorists lined up in rows of cars at a mass drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in Atlanta.

The state of Georgia is partnering with CVS Health in launching rapid testing Monday at a parking deck on Georgia Tech’s midtown Atlanta campus. Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan recently. Georgia has recorded more than 200 virus-linked deaths and more than 1,300 hospitalizations.

Total infections statewide exceed 7,000 and Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, leads the state with nearly 1,000 cases.

Experts say they hope more testing will give a better sense of how widespread the coronavirus is in Georgia.

“Roll your window up, roll your window up!” a police officer yelled at drivers as they approached the first of at least two checkpoints. Dozens of drivers pressed their photo IDs and cellphones against their car windows to show their appointment confirmations. Cars were then directed to another area where testing was being done.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A West Virginia judge in the county with the state’s highest coronavirus caseload has approved strapping ankle monitors to people who test positive but refuse to quarantine. The Monday order allows Kanawha County sheriffs to use the GPS bracelets if someone with the virus ignores an isolation order.

It wasn’t immediately clear how many people violated the mandates, though one local official put the number at “a few.” Officials say at least 345 people statewide have the virus with four reported deaths.

Kanawha County, where the state capital of Charleston is located, has the most positive cases in the state with 56.

Eleven residents of a central Indiana nursing home have died from COVID-19, Indiana Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said Monday.

In addition to the 11 at the Bethany Pointe Health Campus in Anderson, three workers there have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition, Box said during a state news briefing on the pandemic.

The state is helping to transfer residents there without COVID-19 symptoms to another skilled nursing home, Box said.

She said an outbreak in a nursing home had been her biggest fear from the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is a heartbreaking situation and illustrates what a brutal toll the COVID-19 can take on our most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, this will not be the last outbreak of this kind,” Box said.

MIAMI — Dozens of Americans aboard a cruise ship that recently docked in Miami with coronavirus cases are still waiting to disembark because of new federal rules requiring cruise companies to bring them directly home to avoid more infections.

Two passengers died before the Coral Princess ship docked Saturday in Miami and a third died at a hospital. At least 17 passengers have been taken to hospitals. The Miami-Dade mayor said many foreign passengers have disembarked and been taken to the Miami airport where charter planes were ready to fly them abroad. But many of the 250 Americans on board continued to wait, two days after docking.

WARSAW, Poland — Polish lawmakers have voted to conduct the country’s forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting because of the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.

Parliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament late Monday require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking re-election.

Time was an issue for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled — before the pandemic hit — for May 10.

Accelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.

___

GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization on Monday denounced “racist remarks” by two French scientists for suggesting coronavirus vaccine testing should be carried out in Africa.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian who is the first WHO director-general from Africa, said decried “a hangover from a colonial mentality” at a time when he has urged “solidarity” among countries.

He was alluding to comments on a French news program Wednesday that prompted outrage. Dr. Jean-Paul Mira of Paris’ respected Cochin Hospital floated the prospect of carrying out vaccine tests in Africa.

“If I can be provocative,” Mira said on LCI television, “Shouldn’t we do this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatment, no resuscitation?”

The idea drew agreement from another guest, microbiologist Camille Locht from the INSERM medical research institute.

Tedros retorted at a news conference Monday: “Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.”

“The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop and WHO will not allow this to happen,” he said. “It was a disgrace, actually, and appalling to hear during the 21st century from scientists that kind of remark.”

Mira has apologized for the remarks.

ROME — Italy’s day-to-day increase in new COVID-19 cases has dipped again.

The nearly 3,600 new cases that authorities announced on Monday were the lowest day-to-day increase in 20 days. Another number boosting hopes in Italy’s medical community was a small drop, for the third straight day, in the number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections nationwide.

“Substantially, the data confirms the trend” of a slowing of new cases and “gives comfort that the measures of containment against the viral infection are effective,’ said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pneumologist with Rome’s Gemelli Hospital.

Italy now has at least 132,547 confirmed cases, putting it just behind Spain in total known cases. There were 636 deaths in Italy since Sunday, up from 525 a day earlier. But Richeldi said that overall, a downward trend in deaths was holding, showing a decrease of 20 percent compared to a week earlier.

On Monday, Italy marks a month under national lockdown aimed at slowing contagion with the virus.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine received $1.2 million of aid from the United States amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, Ukraine’s president said Monday.

“Grateful to the U.S. for allocating $1.2 million to Ukraine to combat COVID-19,” Zelenskiy said in a tweet after a phone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The aid comes as the outbreak is taking a toll on Ukraine’s economy, with the state budget deficit tripling and incomes plummeting. Ukraine, where 1,319 coronavirus cases have been registered so far, has been in lockdown since March, with the borders closed and the vast majority of businesses not operating.

The country’s government hopes to get a $8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to keep the economy afloat.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia’s government has approved a plan to limit movement across the country over Easter in efforts to contain the coronavirus.

The restrictions will be in place from Wednesday till the end of Easter Monday.

People will only be allowed to travel to work, do essential shopping or visit doctors. Only family members can stay together for any outdoor activities that will be restricted to take place only within one county.

Slovakia is a Roman Catholic stronghold in central and eastern Europe. The government previously banned public gatherings, including religious services.

The government also approved a renewal of border checks with all neighboring countries between Wednesday and April 17.

Slovakia has 534 people infected, two have died.

LONDON — A host of international stars including Chris Martin, Alanis Morissette, John Legend, Billie Eilish, Lang Lang, Elton John and Andrea Bocelli will perform in a live concert on April 18 to raise funds for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

During a press briefing on Monday, Lady Gaga announced she too would be performing in the concert, calling the coronavirus pandemic “a catastrophe” and said she was praying for all those who were sick.

She made her remarks while wearing thick black-rimmed glasses and a sober plaid tweed blazer over a low-cut top.

“My heart is very achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don’t infect their family,” she said. “We all salute you.”

“I would also like to send my prayers to people who are losing their jobs and are having a hard time feeding themselves and their children,” Lady Gaga said.

She added that in the past week, she and others have raised $35 million for buying much-needed protective gear for health workers, improving lab capacities and further research and development into possible drugs and vaccines to treat the new coronavirus.

By NewsDesk @infectiousdiseasenews

The Philippines Department of Health (DOH) is now reporting 2,633 COVID-19 cases, including 107 deaths, as of April 2.

The most confirmed cases have been reported in Quezon City (485), Manila (185), Makati (144) and San Juan City (118).

After meeting with the management and staff of key COVID-19 referral hospitals, Health Secretary Francisco T. Duque III informed them that more personal protective equipment (PPEs) will be distributed to government hospitals.

Secretary Duque reassured health care workers that, aside from the initial 15,000 PPEs, some 885,000 sets are still expected to arrive as the Department of Health (DOH) continuously works with other government agencies and the private sector to transport them to the Philippines. The expansion of the country’s PPE supply comes as the DOH ramps up efforts to build the country’s capacity to handle COVID-19 cases.

“We already have 15,000 PPEs being distributed day by the Office of Civil Defense,” Duque said as he made the rounds in the Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, and Quezon Institute, designated COVID-19 referral centers and quarantine facilities, to engage with hospital management and health care workers and volunteers, and to assess the public health sector’s capacity to treat COVID-19 patients.

Of the initial 15,000 PPEs, the AFP Medical Center received 1,100; the East Avenue Medical Center (EAMC), 770; San Lazaro Hospital, 2,780; the Lung Center, 2,800; the Philippine General Hospital, 2,000; and the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital (DJNRMH), 2,590.

The DOH is making arrangements for the transport of the 885,000 remaining PPEs. “We are currently using a C130 plane to transport these PPEs, and one flight can accommodate 15,000 PPEs. The team is trying to arrange for a bigger plane to transport the PPEs to health care workers faster. We are working with the aviation industry to see what can be done,” the Health Chief said.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine president has extended by half a month to April 30 a lockdown that requires millions of people in the country’s main northern region to stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.

President Rodrigo Duterte said Monday in a late-night TV speech that the government was desperately looking for more funds for a massive cash and food aid intended to prevent the poor from starving to death. There have been appeals for middle-class families to be given emergency aid too, he said.

“If there’s nothing to eat, a human being can be violent especially if he sees his children without food and he’s driven to tears,” Duterte said, adding he has ordered the finance secretary to “steal, borrow, I don’t care,” just to produce more emergency funds.

The government has targeted 18 million low-income families for economic rescue under the lockdown with a 275-billion-peso ($5 billion) budget in the next two months. Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told foreign correspondents Monday 16.3 billion pesos ($320 million) have been distributed so far.

Duterte demanded that the aid be given more rapidly amid complaints of delays and confusion over who should get it.

The Philippines has reported 3,660 cases of COVID-19 disease, including 163 deaths.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, bringing its totals to 10,331 infections and 192 fatalities.

South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said at least 802 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from abroad amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States. Most of these cases have been detected in the past three weeks, inflating the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.

Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Tuesday repeated his public pleas for social distancing and lamented that young people were lining up at clubs and other leisure facilities at risk of becoming “quiet spreaders” of the virus.

While South Korea’s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.

___

BEIJING. — China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the coronarivus over the past 24 hours and just 32 new cases, all from people who returned from overseas.

Another 12 suspected cases — also all imported — were being kept under observation, along with an additional 30 asymptomatic cases. China now has 1,242 confirmed cases in treatment and 1,033 asymptomatic cases under isolation and monitoring.

The country that gave rise to the global pandemic has recorded 3,331 deaths and 81,740 total cases. Numbers of daily new deaths have been hovering in the single digits for weeks, hitting just one on several occasions.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will brief the U.N. Security Council for the first time on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, behind closed doors.

The U.N.’s most powerful body has come under criticism for not addressing the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease. The council has in the past spoken out on two public health emergencies — HIV/AIDS and Ebola.

The U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved a resolution on April 2 recognizing “the unprecedented effects” of the coronavirus pandemic and calling for “intensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat” the COVID-19 disease. Resolutions of the 193-member world body reflect global opinion but are not legally binding.

Diplomats say the Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, is divided between its 10 members who are elected for two-year terms and some of its five permanent members — the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China.

The elected members have been pressing for a council briefing by Guterres and have circulated a draft resolution on the pandemic. France is drafting a rival text.

Diplomats said the permanent members wanted a summit of their leaders before a council meeting, and were trying to arrange one as late as Monday morning, but that meeting failed to materialize.

The Dominican Republic holds the Security Council presidency this month and its spokesperson informed the media late Monday of Thursday’s closed meeting to hear from the secretary-general.

TORONTO — Manufacturing giant 3M says it has an agreement with the Trump administration that will allow the company to continue to send N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America.

3M says the company has a plan to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the U.S.

President Trump had used his authority under the 1950 Defense Production Act to stop exporting such masks, also known as respirators. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting healthcare workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19, outraged many officials in Canada.

3M issued a statement last week saying that could have “significant humanitarian implications” for healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America. The company had said possible retaliation by other nations could actually lead to fewer of the masks being available in the U.S.

In New York City, nearly 1 in 5 police officers were out sick Monday, many with flu-like symptoms.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD has a “very deep bench” with about 36,000 officers and won’t need to bring in reinforcements from other agencies, and police officials say there is no imminent need to move to 12-hour shifts.

In all, more than 2,220 people working for the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus. One detective and a dozen civilian employees have died from the disease.

___

President Donald Trump said he was saddened to hear British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken into intensive care as he battles the new coronavirus.

“Americans are all praying for his recovery,” Trump said during a White House press briefing. “He’s been a really good friend. He’s been really something very special, strong, resolute, doesn’t quit, doesn’t give up.”

Trump said he asked two “leading companies” to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help.

He did not specifically identify the companies, but said “we have contacted all of Boris’s doctors and we’ll see what’s going to take place but they are ready to go.”

“When you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.” Trump said.

The USNS Comfort is now being used for COVID-19 patients.

President Trump confirmed that he’d called New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier Monday to let him know that the USNS Comfort can now be used for COVID-19 patients.

“We’re going to let him do it,” said Trump, adding that the ship will will be used for patients from both New York and New Jersey.

“Hopefully that will be very helpful for both states,” he said.

Cuomo had tweeted shortly before Trump’s news conference began that the ship would add 1,000 beds staffed by federal personnel.

“This will provide much-needed relief to our over stressed hospital systems,” he wrote.

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump is touting the end of a dispute with 3M to supply millions of masks to medical professionals on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.

Trump said that the “3M saga ends very happily. We’re very proud to be dealing now with 3M.”

The president said that the company agreed to deliver an additional “55.5 million high-quality facemasks each month.”

Trump had invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to prevent 3M from exporting masks abroad.

It had sparked some fears that other nations would down on the shipment of medical supplies to the US.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.

Johnson’s office says Johnson is conscious and does not require ventilation at the moment.

Johnson was admitted to St. Thomas’ Hospital late Sunday, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.

Johnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him.

PARIS — France’s health minister has reported the country’s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

Olivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.

Though some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that “we have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.”

France has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.

The total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.

NEW YORK — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the end of the month, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe.

New York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most impacted state with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized.

But the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as have the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said.

Warning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29.

Cuomo stressed that even if New York has reached the peak, numbers could persist at these levels, which would continue to stress struggling hospitals.

___

NEW JERSEY — New Jersey’s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 1,000 people, according to data released Monday from the state’s health department.

In the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003.

New Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials.

Bergen, Essex and Hudson counties in suburban New York have seen the most cases.

“The fear is that I’m telling people that and they’re going to say, ‘Oh, the task at hand is accomplished. We can go back to doing whatever it is we normally do,’” Edwards said. “That is exactly the wrong answer.”

Louisiana has nearly 15,000 people with confirmed infections. The state’s death toll is at least 512.

South Carolina’s governor has added criminal penalties to his orders demanding people stay home unless going to work or the grocery store to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

Gov. Henry McMaster said people can call it a “stay-at-home” order if they like. South Carolina had been the final state east of the Mississippi to not have that specific order.

South Carolina has closed almost all stores that don’t sell medicine, food, home improvement supplies, liquor or guns and banned gathering of three or more people. Anyone violating the governor’s social distancing orders can be ticketed for a misdemeanor and face a $100 fine or 30 days in jail.

McMaster also says he has not been tested for COVID-19. The governor says he has followed protocol that says only test people with symptoms.

At 72, McMaster is the oldest governor in South Carolina’s 350-year history as an English colony and state.

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that because of the coronavirus outbreak schools will remain physically closed for the remainder of the school year and that the state’s more than 1.2 million public and private K-12 students will continue distance learning until the end of June.

Washington state had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.

Schools have been shut statewide since March 17 and were originally scheduled to reopen April 27.

Now, that closure is extended until midnight June 19 — when the spring term ends — and schools are encouraged to continue to provide distance learning. The order also asks schools to start planning for a potential expansion of the order into the summer and fall.

Under the order, some in-person and on-site services such as meetings with seniors to help finish up final projects and tutoring support is allowed only if social distancing and proper hygiene practices are followed.

Last week, Inslee extended orders to keep non-essential businesses closed and most of the state’s residents home through May 4, saying that social distancing measures must remain in place an additional month in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19.

RICHMOND, Va. — Eight more residents of a Virginia long-term care facility who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll amid the outbreak to 28, the facility’s administrator said Monday.

Deaths at the Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County have continued to mount since health officials tested every resident last week because of the scope of the outbreak. That testing showed roughly two-thirds of the residents had the virus.

Thirty-four residents were experiencing symptoms ranging from moderate to mild, and 54 of the residents who tested positive were showing no sign of being ill, the statement said.

Across Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health reported nearly 2,900 confirmed cases and 54 deaths Monday, figures that state health commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said at a news conference were “almost definitely an underestimate” because of a lack of widespread testing.

TORONTO — The premier of Canada’s most populous province says U.S. officials have stopped 3 million masks from getting to Ontario from manufacturing giant 3M but he says 500,000 of them are being released Monday.

Ontario Premier Doug Ford says getting masks across the U.S. border is difficult after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks.

Ford says he’s hopeful Canada will get an exemption and says he feels better about that after speaking with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ford says he’s grateful for anything he can from the U.S. after delays in global shipments and recent restrictions at the U.S. border have left Ontario with about a one-week supply of critical protective equipment for health care workers.

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker began his daily briefing with a response to President Donald Trump’s poor assessment of his performance.

The Democratic governor again went over what the state had received from the national stockpile and what the state had procured on its own.

As an example, he noted that the federal government had supplied 368,000 N95 masks and 693,000 gloves, while the state had procured 10 million N95 masks and 19 million gloves.

At the same time, Pritzker said the state’s “10-day burn rate for PPE” is 1.5 million N95 masks and 25 million gloves.

“To anyone who wants a response to some of the blame-shifting coming out of the White House, all I have to say is, look at the numbers,” Pritzker said.

ATLANTA — Motorists lined up in rows of cars at a mass drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in Atlanta.

The state of Georgia is partnering with CVS Health in launching rapid testing Monday at a parking deck on Georgia Tech’s midtown Atlanta campus. Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan recently. Georgia has recorded more than 200 virus-linked deaths and more than 1,300 hospitalizations.

Total infections statewide exceed 7,000 and Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, leads the state with nearly 1,000 cases.

Experts say they hope more testing will give a better sense of how widespread the coronavirus is in Georgia.

“Roll your window up, roll your window up!” a police officer yelled at drivers as they approached the first of at least two checkpoints. Dozens of drivers pressed their photo IDs and cellphones against their car windows to show their appointment confirmations. Cars were then directed to another area where testing was being done.

CHARLESTON, W.Va. — A West Virginia judge in the county with the state’s highest coronavirus caseload has approved strapping ankle monitors to people who test positive but refuse to quarantine. The Monday order allows Kanawha County sheriffs to use the GPS bracelets if someone with the virus ignores an isolation order.

It wasn’t immediately clear how many people violated the mandates, though one local official put the number at “a few.” Officials say at least 345 people statewide have the virus with four reported deaths.

Kanawha County, where the state capital of Charleston is located, has the most positive cases in the state with 56.

Eleven residents of a central Indiana nursing home have died from COVID-19, Indiana Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said Monday.

In addition to the 11 at the Bethany Pointe Health Campus in Anderson, three workers there have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition, Box said during a state news briefing on the pandemic.

The state is helping to transfer residents there without COVID-19 symptoms to another skilled nursing home, Box said.

She said an outbreak in a nursing home had been her biggest fear from the coronavirus pandemic.

“This is a heartbreaking situation and illustrates what a brutal toll the COVID-19 can take on our most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, this will not be the last outbreak of this kind,” Box said.

MIAMI — Dozens of Americans aboard a cruise ship that recently docked in Miami with coronavirus cases are still waiting to disembark because of new federal rules requiring cruise companies to bring them directly home to avoid more infections.

Two passengers died before the Coral Princess ship docked Saturday in Miami and a third died at a hospital. At least 17 passengers have been taken to hospitals. The Miami-Dade mayor said many foreign passengers have disembarked and been taken to the Miami airport where charter planes were ready to fly them abroad. But many of the 250 Americans on board continued to wait, two days after docking.

WARSAW, Poland — Polish lawmakers have voted to conduct the country’s forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting because of the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.

Parliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament late Monday require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking re-election.

Time was an issue for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled — before the pandemic hit — for May 10.

Accelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.

GENEVA — The head of the World Health Organization on Monday denounced “racist remarks” by two French scientists for suggesting coronavirus vaccine testing should be carried out in Africa.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian who is the first WHO director-general from Africa, said decried “a hangover from a colonial mentality” at a time when he has urged “solidarity” among countries.

He was alluding to comments on a French news program Wednesday that prompted outrage. Dr. Jean-Paul Mira of Paris’ respected Cochin Hospital floated the prospect of carrying out vaccine tests in Africa.

“If I can be provocative,” Mira said on LCI television, “Shouldn’t we do this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatment, no resuscitation?”

The idea drew agreement from another guest, microbiologist Camille Locht from the INSERM medical research institute.

Tedros retorted at a news conference Monday: “Africa cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.”

“The hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop and WHO will not allow this to happen,” he said. “It was a disgrace, actually, and appalling to hear during the 21st century from scientists that kind of remark.”

Mira has apologized for the remarks.

ROME — Italy’s day-to-day increase in new COVID-19 cases has dipped again.

The nearly 3,600 new cases that authorities announced on Monday were the lowest day-to-day increase in 20 days. Another number boosting hopes in Italy’s medical community was a small drop, for the third straight day, in the number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections nationwide.

“Substantially, the data confirms the trend” of a slowing of new cases and “gives comfort that the measures of containment against the viral infection are effective,’’ said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pneumologist with Rome’s Gemelli Hospital.

Italy now has at least 132,547 confirmed cases, putting it just behind Spain in total known cases. There were 636 deaths in Italy since Sunday, up from 525 a day earlier. But Richeldi said that overall, a downward trend in deaths was holding, showing a decrease of 20 percent compared to a week earlier.

On Monday, Italy marks a month under national lockdown aimed at slowing contagion with the virus.

KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine received $1.2 million of aid from the United States amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, Ukraine’s president said Monday.

“Grateful to the U.S. for allocating $1.2 million to Ukraine to combat COVID-19,” Zelenskiy said in a tweet after a phone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The aid comes as the outbreak is taking a toll on Ukraine’s economy, with the state budget deficit tripling and incomes plummeting. Ukraine, where 1,319 coronavirus cases have been registered so far, has been in lockdown since March, with the borders closed and the vast majority of businesses not operating.

The country’s government hopes to get a $8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to keep the economy afloat.

BRATISLAVA, Slovakia — Slovakia’s government has approved a plan to limit movement across the country over Easter in efforts to contain the coronavirus.

The restrictions will be in place from Wednesday till the end of Easter Monday.

People will only be allowed to travel to work, do essential shopping or visit doctors. Only family members can stay together for any outdoor activities that will be restricted to take place only within one county.

Slovakia is a Roman Catholic stronghold in central and eastern Europe. The government previously banned public gatherings, including religious services.

The government also approved a renewal of border checks with all neighboring countries between Wednesday and April 17.

Slovakia has 534 people infected, two have died.

LONDON — A host of international stars including Chris Martin, Alanis Morissette, John Legend, Billie Eilish, Lang Lang, Elton John and Andrea Bocelli will perform in a live concert on April 18 to raise funds for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

During a press briefing on Monday, Lady Gaga announced she too would be performing in the concert, calling the coronavirus pandemic “a catastrophe” and said she was praying for all those who were sick.

She made her remarks while wearing thick black-rimmed glasses and a sober plaid tweed blazer over a low-cut top.

“My heart is very achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don’t infect their family,” she said. “We all salute you.”

“I would also like to send my prayers to people who are losing their jobs and are having a hard time feeding themselves and their children,” Lady Gaga said.

She added that in the past week, she and others have raised $35 million for buying much-needed protective gear for health workers, improving lab capacities and further research and development into possible drugs and vaccines to treat the new coronavirus.

As the numbers now stand, over a million people globally are infected with the novel coronavirus. The world is currently threatened by a disease that is more contagious than SARS, which brings up the necessary question: will the world cooperate and unite in solidarity to fight this global pandemic?

In a video conference with over 100 international development organization representatives, Rania Al Mashat, Egypt’s Minister of International Cooperation, presented a forward-looking strategy, New Global Partnership Narrative, which prioritizes cooperation among international development partners as well as the achievement of UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

“Streamlining efforts under one

umbrella: mindful mobilization.”

The strategy, in short, aims to streamline all efforts under one umbrella: mindful mobilization. Rather than focusing on short-term solutions, it hopes to ensure that the promotion of future collaborations is based on an up-to-date, consistent and a complete narrative between the Government of Egypt and its multilateral and bilateral development partners.

Dina Saleh, director of the sub-regional office of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) of the United Nations in Egypt and the Middle East region, praised the new strategy, noting that the Ministry of International Cooperation plays a pivotal and important role in bringing together all development partners.

She also stressed that the International Fund for Agricultural Development is ready to provide all support to the Egyptian to ensure reducing the negative impact of the coronavirus on the agricultural sector.

Other development partners, notably the United Nations, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), expressed their approval of Egypt’s strategy and their commitment to support the country in its fight against the global pandemic.

“The EBRD is working urgently across Egypt to deliver our €1 billion global solidarity package to companies and banks that are suffering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,” Dr. Heike Harmgart, Managing Director of EBRD for its southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, said, “We already working with existing clients across Egypt to understand their needs and support them with working capital, trade finance as well as taking an enabling view to re-scheduling if existing loans.”

Re-imagining the Next Normal

Economists and experts around the world are currently debating new policies to confront the world’s future challenges. In a recent article by the Economist, it was noted that countries are now trying new radical economic policies to counter COVID-19. “The rules of the game have been moving in one direction for centuries. Another radical change is looming,” it was mentioned.

For that reason, Egypt is working to create a new vision that will focus on three pillars: ‘People at the Core’, ‘Projects in Action’ and ‘Purpose as the Driver’.

It is a strategy that does not just target development-minded people, but for those with an interest in human development.

It is not just to sell or communicate with other partners and people, but to build together and include everyone.

“Through our New Global Partnerships Framework and communication framework, the Ministry of International Cooperation aims to ensure that COVID-19 does not derail us from pushing forward with the SDG agenda. It is an innovative means to transparently showcase projects with purpose and their impact on people to boost inclusive growth as a means to promote SDGs and bolster credibility,” Al Mashat stated.

For the first pillar, Egypt is committed to improving the Egyptian peoples lives by identifying existing gaps and providing multi – sectoral assistance through public private partnerships that push Egyptians towards realizing their full potential.

As for the second pillar, the Minister highlighted that projects have been implemented across multiple sectors including in education, transportation, water desalination, renewable energy, entrepreneurship, and women empowerment.

For the third pillar, the Minister referred to partnerships with purpose as key drivers to generate sustained and inclusive growth in a rapidly changing world.

PROTECT, PROVIDE, AND PROGRESS

Egypt’s response in COVID-19 fight stresses on the importance of protecting the population from the virus, providing easier access to credit to help households smooth consumption and liquidity for firms to survive the disruption, and pushing progress by expediting structural reforms through and beyond COVID-19.

“You can’t win a football game only by defending,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “To win, we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics.”

To ensure that the country is preparing for the future and that sustainable development is at the core, a clear strategy was outlined to ensure that each goal is given enough attention and focus.

GOAL 8: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH

To mitigate impact on an un-organized labor force, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefits will be provided, as well as prioritizing the transition from an informal to a formal sector.

A new debt relief initiative for individuals at risk of default has also been announced that will waive marginal interest on debt under EGP 1 million if customers make a 50 percent payment.

The preferential interest rate on loans to SMEs, industry, tourism and housing for low-income and middle-class families has been reduced, and the regulations issued last year requiring banks to obtain detailed information of borrowers have been relaxed.

GOAL 10: REDUCE INEQUALITIES

To reduce inequality, the Minister highlighted 60,000 households were added to Takaful and Karama Program. An additional 100,000 will be added as the budget will increase to 19.3 Billion EGP compared to 18.5 billion EGP.

A one-off monetary compensation (500 EGP) offered to informal workers registered at the database of the Ministry of Manpower through post offices. Registration had been done for approximately one million individuals working in construction, agriculture, fishing, plumbing.

GOAL 5: GENDER EQUALITY

The government also increased payments to women community leaders in rural areas from EGP 350 to EGP 900 per month to ensure gender equity.

GOAL 4: QUALITY EDUCATION

Egypt launched a new digital library available for free to every Egyptian student with learning material (digital objects) extracted from EKB and sorted out/assembled for G1-G12 students in both Arabic and English.

In a parallel action, the Ministry of Education and Technical Education (MOETE) decided to deploy a customized version of the Edmodo Learning Management System for around 55,000 schools and train teachers to create their own virtual classrooms and invite their own students (and possibly their parents as well).

GOAL 3: GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING

Alternative mechanisms for testing patients were identified through the establishment of 27 laboratories across the country and additional 4 university laboratories, as well as scaling up the infection prevention and control (IPC) program with the WHO to prevent transmission and ensure patients & health workers are protected.

It also aims to expand capacity to conduct up to 200,000 tests within two weeks and setting up eight isolation hospitals with capacity of 2000 beds with 1000 ICU beds, as well as 400 ventilators and setting field hospitals for the admission of mild and asymptotic cases.

Metran Co Chief Executive Kazufuku Nitta said the approach was made late last month and that the United States, Britain and India are among over 30 countries the company is talking to.

Ventilators, which assist patients struggling to breathe, are in short supply in many countries hardest hit by COVID-19, the pneumonia-like disease caused by the coronavirus.

In the United States, medical equipment makers said they would simplify ventilator designs and push other work aside to increase production, while automakers have also offered to make the devices. Elsewhere, Swiss manufacturer Hamilton Medical AG said Britain faces a “massive shortage” of ventilators.

Privately held Metran also makes ventilators for humans, but Nitta said its veterinary devices are simpler and so are a tenth of the cost to produce and easier to operate.

“In a pandemic, there won’t be enough doctors with expert knowledge on site,” Nitta told Reuters in a recent interview at Metran’s factory in Kawaguchi, north of Tokyo. “A simple and a safe machine is needed for doctors who are not familiar with the device.”

The number of new coronavirus cases continues to climb in Japan, stoking concern about strain on the nation’s healthcare system. More than 3,500 people have tested positive for the virus in Japan - with over 1,000 in Tokyo - and 85 have died, public broadcaster NHK reported.

On Friday, the government ordered regions suffering the most serious outbreaks to save hospital beds for severely ill patients.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told parliament that his government had secured over 8,000 ventilators necessary to treat patients in serious condition.

Metran is considering a system for producing 5,000 to 15,000 animal respirators, Nitta said, without providing a time frame.

He nevertheless expects demand to outpace that, so is also considering licensing the product for overseas firms to manufacture.",,"['8,000 ventilators']",,

Photo by VnExpress/Giang Huy.

Deputy Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said at an online meeting Monday that there is no shortage of test kits to diagnose the novel coronavirus infection, including kits for real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid testing.

The 200,000 rapid test kits imported from South Korea in the coming time will be used for testing 37,000 people in centralized quarantine areas, tens of thousands of people under home quarantine and those coming to Covid-19 hotspot Bach Mai Hospital in Hanoi from March 12 onwards, Long said.

Localities can either do real-time RT-PCR tests, a technique that combines reverse transcription of RNA into DNA and amplification of specific DNA targets using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or they can wait for quick test kits.

The Health Ministry also noted that rapid test kits should only be used after seven days after exposure to the pathogen. Before three days, the sensitivity and specificity are very low, it said.

Earlier, Vietnam had successfully produced test kits that help diagnose a Covid-19 infection in just an hour.

Currently, the health ministry allows 21 medical facilities around the country to carry out Covid-19 tests, in addition to the three approved by the World Health Organization.

On Monday, Hanoi Chairman Nguyen Duc Chung ordered the city’s Health Department to set up 10 teams and arrange 10 quick Covid-19 test stations around the Bach Mai Hospital to carry out mass testing in the context of the hospital becoming the country’s main Covid-19 hotspot with 25 infections.

Chung also asked the city’s Center for Disease Control, which received 5,000 rapid test kits from the ministry on March 29, to conduct rapid testing immediately.

""The kits will show results in 10 minutes through blood samples,"" Chung said.

Hanoi, with 86 Covid-19 infections, is the locality with the highest number of cases among Vietnam's 204.

Of the national cases, 55 have been discharged from hospitals so far, including the largest single-batch release of 27 from a Hanoi hospital Monday morning.

Many of the currently active cases are Vietnamese nationals returning from Europe and the U.S., foreigners coming from the same regions and those who’d come in contact with both groups of people.

HANOI, April 3 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s biggest listed firm Vingroup said on Friday it will produce ventilators for the Southeast Asian country’s fight against the new coronavirus.

The company has entered into a licence agreement with Medtronic for its PB560 ventilator production, the company said in an emailed statement, adding that it would also produce low-cost open-source ventilators designed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Vingroup said it would be able to produce up to 55,000 units a month at its existing automobile and smartphone factories in Vietnam, including 10,000 PB560 ventilators.

Production would begin within weeks, it said, adding that the firm could also produce ventilators for foreign markets.

Brendan McDermid | Reuters

The world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others. But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors. In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany's decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.'s decision to only test symptomatic cases. Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany's less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors. ""I think so far we've been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,"" he told CNBC Thursday.

""So we had a minor but important delay in the wave of infections coming to Germany. Secondly, the first people that got infected in Germany tended to be younger than the average of the population ... so we were hit later and with younger patients initially."" Lauterbach noted that a third factor that helped Germany was a slow increase in the number of infections, allowing those patients to be treated at the country's top medical institutions, including some of the country's best university hospitals (including those in Bonn, Dusseldorf, Aachen and Cologne) in the Heinsberg region where there was a cluster of infections at the start of the outbreak. ""Number four, all things considered, the German health-care system and hospital system has been modernized by the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats over the last 20 years ... this meant we had more hospital beds, more ventilators, more ICU (Intensive Care Units) beds and more hospital doctors, roughly speaking, than any other comparable country in Europe ... So our system is in a reasonable shape for such an epidemic.""

Suppression strategy

While almost all European countries have introduced lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, fatality rates have differed wildly. The mortality rate in Italy around the end of March stood at 11%, for example. Germany's rate is comparable with South Korea, a country that has also attracted plaudits for its management of the coronavirus crisis with extensive testing, contact tracing and digital surveillance of its citizens. Germany's lockdown, alongside a rigorous testing regime, has also helped, Lauterbach said. While countries like the U.K. now have to build a diagnostics industry from scratch, Germany already had one built around the multinational might of Roche. The country reportedly has the capacity to carry out up to 500,000 tests a week, whereas the U.K. can currently only manage just over 10,000 a day.","['500,000 tests']",,,

Germany still needs to increase its coronavirus testing rate dramatically if it wants to successfully manage the virus, scientists are advising the government.

The country has the capacity to carry out up to 500,000 tests a week, but must increase that to more than a million, or 200,000 tests a day, they say. This is despite other countries looking to Germany because of its comparatively high testing rate and relatively low death rate from Covid-19 of under 1%.

As the British government has struggled to tackle a testing shortfall, Germany has been repeatedly named as an example to follow in recent days, but a confidential scientific study commissioned by the government and recently leaked to German media showed that if it wanted to avoid a mass outbreak of the coronavirus, the country would have to greatly increase its testing capacity.

Ever since the government’s introduction of a strict lockdown, including closing the country’s borders and shutting down schools and nurseries, the scientists said around a million people in Germany – which has a population of just under 83 million – were likely to become infected, and around 12,000 would die. That outlook, however, was based on an increase in testing to 100,000 a day and within weeks to 200,000 a day.

The study’s authors said that in order to carry out testing in the most efficient and quickest way possible, it would also be necessary in the longer term to rely on the use of big data and location tracking via mobile phones, an issue that is controversial in Germany.

Lothar Wieler, the head of the government’s main public health advisory body, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said that while German testing was high compared with other countries, it would have to be speeded up. “We need to increase efficiency,” he said, adding that he welcomed the news that the use of quicker and simpler tests, in addition to the current standard PCR – polymerase chain reaction test, which directly detects the DNA or RNA of the pathogen – would soon be available.

Germany has a large network of more than 85 laboratories and a good history of detecting illness early. A nationwide network set up between doctors’ practices, normally used to monitor the flu, was also used for testing for Covid-19 from February onwards, and the fact the system only detected a case on 12 March indicates that the virus was not widespread before then..

There has been huge worldwide interest in why the death rate in Germany from Covid-19 has remained much lower than many other countries. Germany’s death rate is around 0.5%, compared with Italy’s 9.5%, and a worldwide rate of around 4.7%.

“The fact is that Germany started testing early on and has tested broadly. That way, many cases but also milder cases have been detected, and they did not generally include the elderly,” Wieler said.

It has, he said, in effect distorted the figures. He warns that the situation in Germany is likely to worsen, as many more of the elderly who have so far not been so affected, are likely to get sick. “We are still at the start of the epidemic, and it is completely unclear as to how it will develop,” Wieler said. “But of course the number of deaths in Germany will rise.”

He has insisted there is not, as has sometimes been suspected, an “under-reporting” of deaths from Covid-19 by hospitals. It would in theory be possible that some deaths were not counted as deaths from coronavirus, if the patient had an underlying health condition. But that is seldom likely to be the case, due to the sensibility towards the illness right now. Only if someone with coronavirus was killed by something unrelated to the virus, such as a car crash, would they not be included, medical authorities say.

Testing laboratories across Germany report that while they have been at pains to increase their capacity, they face many obstacles. Germany’s federal system has contributed to an inefficient gathering of data – including an unclear picture of how much testing has been done – and delays in testing suspected cases, delivering results or informing contact people. Germany’s regional health bodies have recruited extra staff to help deal with the backlog, but say they are struggling to keep up. The RKI has recruited scouts – often medical students and trained doctors who arrived as refugees but are waiting to have their qualifications recognised – to support the system.

Accredited Laboratories in Medicine (ALM), the largest association representing laboratories in Germany working on the tests, has said that testing capacity has increased significantly since the first case emerged in the country at the end of January.

“We’re working around the clock, in a shift system, including at weekends,” Evangelos Kotsopoulos, head of ALM told Die Zeit newspaper. “Our main bottlenecks are staff – many of whom have young children and are affected by school and nursery closures – and supplies from industry. Around the world there are only five or six big suppliers for the materials that we need.”

Kotsopoulos said Germany should be far more focused on who it tested, to ensure those “who don’t have symptoms but just want to know whether they have it or not” are not tested, in favour of those such as at-risk patients for whom it is considered a necessity. “It is simply not practically possible right now to test everyone in a population of our size,” he said.

According to the RKI’s guideline, priority should be given to testing medical workers, people with underlying health conditions showing coronavirus symptoms and those in contact with those who are infected, so as to be able to place them under quarantine.

But many working on the testing frontline report concerns about a lack of materials and inefficiency, as well as a shortage of staff, forcing many people to work seven-day weeks.

“The reagents we need are produced by just three manufacturers in Germany and they have run dry,” Elisabeth Koerber-Kröll from the district medical faculty in Schwäbisch Hall, in Baden-Württemberg, south-west Germany, one of the hardest hit regions told broadcaster SWR.

Increasing emphasis is also being put on antibody tests, as well as antigen tests, as a more efficient way of managing the spread of the virus, in addition to self-testing, although many are sceptical that that this is reliable enough.","['200,000 tests', '500,000 tests']",,,
Germany,,https://time.com/5812555/germany-coronavirus-deaths/,Why Is Germany's Coronavirus Death Rate So Low?,"With more than 63,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of March 30, Germany is one of the countries worst-affected by the pandemic, according to official statistics.

But only 560 people known to be suffering from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus have died there, putting Germany’s case fatality rate at just 0.9%. That gives Germany one of the lowest rates in the world, making it an outlier compared to places like Italy, where 11.0% of confirmed patients have died from the disease, and even the U.S., which has a rate of 1.8%.

According to experts, Germany’s case fatality rate is so low due to its widespread testing. “In some countries only very symptomatic cases are tested (e.g. in Italy) and in others a broader testing strategy is done (e.g. in Germany),” writes Dr. Dietrich Rothenbacher, the director of the Institute for Epidemiology at Ulm University in Germany, in an email to TIME. That means that while Germany is currently the country with the fifth-most infections in the world, chances are that it has fewer unreported cases than many other countries, where testing is harder to come by.

“Between countries there are several reasons why the death rate might vary, but they’re very small compared to the impact of how many people get tested,” says Dr. Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “Germany very rapidly rolled out testing to a very large number of people, relative to the population.”

As of March 15, Germany was behind only the UAE, South Korea and Australia as the country to have administered the most tests in the world per capita, at an estimated 2,023 per million people. (In South Korea, the only of these countries where the pandemic is at a similarly advanced stage to Germany, the case fatality rate stands at around 1.6%.) On March 20, Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute—Germany’s main public health body—said German laboratories are now able to conduct some 160,000 tests per week, about as many as they performed in the entire two months to March 15.

Back in January, Germany became one of the first countries to develop a reliable method for testing for COVID-19. Unburdened by a restrictive central regulatory body, since healthcare is administered at the state level in Germany, private companies moved quickly to mass produce those tests, meaning they could be rolled out rapidly to the population. At least 1.4 million of the tests distributed worldwide by the World Health Organization by the end of February were produced by one German company based in Berlin.

Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration stalled. It took until early March to allow some large companies to manufacture their own tests, leading to a shortage.

“Because Germany rolled testing out so quickly as the epidemic was growing, it meant they were selectively more likely to identify milder cases,” Smeeth tells TIME. Countries without such capabilities were forced to prioritize testing severe cases while leaving mild cases undiagnosed and therefore not included in the official numbers. “The more cases you ascertain, the death rate is going to go down,” Smeeth says.

Even though Germany and Italy’s populations have similar average ages—they’re the two most elderly nations in the European Union—the median age of Germany’s population known to be infected by COVID-19 is lower: 46 as opposed to Italy’s 63. Smeeth says the lower average age is likely to just be a side effect of widespread testing. “If you are testing more people, then you will get a much younger age distribution of positive cases,” Smeeth says. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that the true age distribution of the virus is radically different between the two countries.”

Germany also has a high number of intensive care beds, meaning its hospitals have so far not been overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients in the same way some hospitals in Northern Italy have. According to a paper published in 2012, Germany had 29.2 critical care beds per 100,000 people—more than double Italy’s 12.5. (In the U.S., it’s even higher, at 34.2.) And these beds are currently only 70-80% occupied, according to Germany’s Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft (DKG), an umbrella group of hospital operators. “This means that there is for now sufficient capacity for seriously ill coronavirus patients,” the DKG says on its website.

But Germany’s comparatively low death toll will not last, even if the ratio does. COVID-19 can leave patients critically ill for weeks before killing them, and the country is at an earlier stage than Italy in terms of transmission of the disease.

“We in Germany are in an early phase of the pandemic,” Rothenbacher says. “Fatality numbers always have a lag-time—in two to three weeks the numbers may look different.”

As the coronavirus crisis tests the resilience of democracies around the globe, Germany has gone from cursing its lead-footed, decentralised political system to wondering if federalism’s tortoise versus hare logic puts it in a better position to brave the pandemic than most.

Under German federalism – which has roots going back to the Holy Roman Empire but was entrenched after the Nazi era to weaken centralised rule – key policy areas, such as health, education and cultural affairs, fall under the jurisdiction of the country’s 16 states, or Länder.

At the start of the Covid-19 outbreak, such a highly devolved system of governance made the woman nominally in charge of the country look oddly powerless: even when Angela Merkel announced the first raft of social-distancing measures, she could only make recommendations that the federal states were free to implement or ignore.

As social-distancing measures came into effect, there were howls of frustration over how wildly the lockdowns varied between the states: in Berlin, for example, buying a book from a shop is still allowed but having a picnic in the park is not. In Baden-Württemberg, it’s the other way around.

Federalism is useful for creating a dynamic business environment between different regions, but it can make it hard for an entire country to move in sync.

I don’t have to wait to get a call from the health minister before I can go ahead with a test. Matthias Orth, Marienhospital Stuttgart

States in the formerly socialist east, less severely hit by the virus, were reluctant to close their schools, drawing ire from southern states who feared their students would then be put at a disadvantage.

A week and a half into the de facto lockdown, however, Germany is beginning to discover the upsides of a system which distributes, rather than centralises, power.

The country suddenly finds itself being held up as the model to be emulated for its high rates of testing – seen by many as the only strategy for being able to navigate a route out of lockdown measures.

German public health services are provided not by one central authority but by approximately 400 public health offices, run by municipality and rural district administrations.

Such an environment allows for a variety of laboratories – some attached to universities or hospitals, others privately run, medium-sized businesses – which act largely autonomously of central control.

“I don’t have to wait to get a call from the health minister before I can go ahead with a test,” said Matthias Orth, of the Institute of Laboratory Medicine at Stuttgart’s Marienhospital.

Some private labs started offering tests for the Covid-19 virus long before statutory health insurers were offering to pay for the tests, giving Germany a head start. Now around 250 laboratories are carrying out between 300,000 and 500,000 tests for Covid-19 every week.

Its healthcare system shows how Germany prevented a runaway death toll.,"Germany has had remarkably few COVID-19 deaths, which experts attribute partly to its high number of hospital beds and ICU beds.

The country was also quick to roll out reliable tests for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and initiate strict social distancing measures to prevent the spread.

Part of the reason Germany was so quick to start testing for COVID-19 is that private labs nationwide were free to offer tests, and as of April 2 have helped the country test 1 million people for the disease.

Germany hasn't stopped the coronavirus completely. It continues to see an uptick in cases and deaths.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

With a combination of widespread testing and a robust healthcare system, Germany has provided a potential template for how countries can adapt to the coronavirus threat and blunt its impact.

Here's how Germany turned itself around as one of the European countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases to having one of the lowest mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide.

January: Germany's unconcern with coronavirus

In January, when COVID-19 was ravaging China, Germany still regarded the illness as a far-off, and likely minor, threat. In late January, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that COVID-19 posed a very low health risk.

But it took just a few days for signs of trouble to erupt. Germany had discovered its first few COVID-19 cases by January 27, but thought they were little more than local threats that could be easily managed.

Germany wasn't the only country with this reaction. On January 22, US President Donald Trump was asked whether he was worried about the coronavirus outbreak. ""It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,"" Trump said. ""It's going to be just fine.""

At the time, Germany and the US seemed to be on the same page.

February: Germany has one of the highest infection rates in the world

Over the course of February, the situation had changed dramatically in Germany.

The coronavirus threat was increasing by the day and with 48 confirmed cases by February 28, Germany had the second-highest number of cases in Europe behind Italy's 644 cases. It was also just behind the 60 cases confirmed in the US.

That seemed to be the point at which Germany and the US started to diverge in their response to COVID-19. Just two days prior, on February 26, Trump said that the US coronavirus threat was ""going down, not up."" The next day, he said the threat would, ""like a miracle,"" evaporate.

But Germany sprung into action. By the time Trump made his comments, Germany was already taking action to address the coronavirus threat.

Late February and early March: Germany's forceful and rapid response

In late February, the country extended school and daycare facility closures and required anyone who had contact with confirmed cases to remain in isolation for 14 days. Even in unconfirmed cases — those who had been near someone with coronavirus-like symptoms — were told to self-isolate.

Meanwhile, the government said that it would limit outside travel into the country and begin acquiring protective medical equipment to prepare for the COVID-19 fight. Along the way, despite an inability to get rapid test results, Germany was ramping up its testing efforts.

""Germany was able to react to the situation unfolding in China in January and have testing established by mid-February,"" said epidemiology professor at Yale School of Public Health Nathan Grubaugh. ""They could do this in part because Germany doesn't have a centralized diagnostic system so labs around the country were free to establish tests."" In fact, as of April 2, private labs in Germany have helped the country test 1 million people for COVID-19.

Germany was one of the first countries to develop a testing system for COVID-19. It's early access to reliable tests for COVID-19 meant that Germany could ""get a much better handle on who was infected, isolate contacts, and treat those who need care,"" Jennifer Kates, the senior vice president and global health and HIV policy director at the Kaiser Family Foundation said.

March 9-10: The first deaths

Despite widespread testing efforts, the German coronavirus outbreak continued. By March 9, Germany had approximately 1,200 cases and had recorded its first two deaths. The same day, the US had accumulated 950 cases and 28 deaths.

German chancellor Angela Merkel and her administration told Germany that they would need to do ""everything possible"" to slow the coronavirus spread and save lives. She announced that gatherings of more than 1,000 people would be shut down. This was 7 days before Trump recommended social distancing measures in the US based on CDC guidelines.

But perhaps what has contributed to Germany's low death rate most is an ace up its sleeve that many other countries can't match: An extremely high bed-to-person ratio. According to data from HealthSystemTracker, Germany has 8.1 hospital beds per 1,000 people and 6.1 ICU beds per 1,000 people. Italy has 3.2 hospital beds per 1,000 and 2.6 ICU beds per 1,000. The US has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 and 2.4 ICU beds per 1,000 people.

""Germany hospital capacity surpasses that of many other countries,"" Kates said. It's been a key factor in saving lives and not overwhelming a strained healthcare system.

March 17: A bigger risk — and problems testing

On March 17, the Robert Koch Institute, which monitors public health across the country, changed COVID-19's health risk to ""high"" in Germany.

The German government said that because of a lag of about three to four days between testing and results, it believed the real number of cases was higher than the recorded 7,000, or so. Germany quickly expanded the number of COVID-19 beds by 1,000 to accommodate extra needs.

In the ensuing days, more curfews and quarantines went into effect. Social distancing, a core component in any country's battle with COVID-19, was further tightened as schools, daycare facilities, and other gathering limitations were extended. At the right time, Germany responded forcefully, experts said.

""The factors [in Germany's success] have not been in place in other settings,"" Kates said. ""The US has largely bungled its testing effort and Italy's hospitals have been overwhelmed. These are very hard barriers to overcome once countries are at this point.""

But Germany wasn't done.

March 22: A widespread crackdown

By March 22, Germany's cases hovered at around 25,000, but deaths were just 86 — a fatality rate of approximately 0.3% that easily outpaced China, Italy, and nearly every other country around the world.

That day, the German government announced that people would need to remain six feet apart, and gatherings of more than two people were forbidden. Germans were also asked to stay home, unless necessary.

It was a move made just a day after Italy announced similar national restrictions on movement and non-essential business activity. But by then, the differences between Germany and Italy were stark: Italy reached more than 59,000 cases that day and nearly 5,500 deaths.

In the US, the coronavirus battle was ramping up. On March 22, the US 140 deaths that day and 557 cumulative fatalities. A mortality rate of 1.2%. This is partly due to the country's slow roll out of tests early on, Grubaugh said.

Late March into April: Questions abound

Statistics indicate that Germany is in a far better place than many of the other developed countries worldwide. And testing may be central to its success.

Late last month, Germany said that it could conduct 160,000 tests each week, and has been able to test more than 2,000 per million people. It's now using rapid testing to identify patients within hours, and it's not letting up.

""It's becoming clear that the countries that rolled out rapid wide-scale testing are the ones that are also controlling the virus better,"" Grubaugh said.

""If countries that have yet to see surging cases can implement early widespread testing, isolation of those infected and contact tracing, coupled with shoring up their health system capacity, they can see success,"" Kates said.

Germany hit all the right marks. But the fight remains.

Experts cautioned that Germany may not have reached its peak. The country added about 4,000 new cases on March 28. On March 30 cases were up 4,600 to a cumulative total of 61,913.

Meanwhile, deaths are increasing. On March 29, Germany recorded 66 deaths due to COVID-19. That figure increased 128 on March 30. Germany's death rate is now 1.2% -- still lower compared to many other parts of the world.

It's unclear what might be happening in Germany and whether the worst is behind the country. But there are clear indications that this story is far from over.

Germany’s Draegerwerk said its government placed an order for 10,000 ventilators for intensive respiratory care, the medical gear maker’s largest order ever and equivalent to a year’s normal production.

Hard-hit Italy, with more than 10,000 infections and 1,000 deaths from the virus so far, tendered for 5,000 ventilators and other desperately needed medical equipment.

Italy may have less than a quarter of the breathing machines necessary to help patients as infections fill their lungs with fluid, Andreas Wieland, chief executive of the world’s largest ventilator maker Hamilton Medical, told Reuters.

“There’s a huge discrepancy between available ventilators and the need,” Wieland said in an interview, adding that the U.S. Army is among customers looking to order more. “Turkey has ordered many ventilators, China has ordered many devices, the United States – actually, everyone is ordering.”

“In recent years, countries have been building up their supply of ventilators, to prepare for a potential problem situation,” Wieland added. “But nobody expected such a situation to take on such dramatic proportions.”

Privately owned Hamilton Medical, a Swiss company which usually makes 15,000 ventilators a year, has ramped up its production by 30-40%, Wieland said.

Draegerwerk also plans to boost production at its factory in the north German city of Luebeck as the worldwide death toll from coronavirus topped 4,900.

NATIONS STOCKPILE

Draegerwerk’s massive German order departs from typical buying by hospitals.

“It’s unusual for a government to order medical gear directly,” a spokesman told Reuters. “Normally customers in Germany are hospitals and clinics.”

The national scramble for equipment raised concerns about possible export restrictions, setting back cooperative efforts to tackle the disease.

Without mentioning specific governments, Swedish Enterprise Minister Ibrahim Baylan said at a news conference that some nations were circumventing the European Commission to block exports. “We must find our way back to cooperation,” Baylan said.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters that limits placed on exports by countries including France and Germany undermined the EU single market at a time it had to function.

“I have been in very close contact with Germany, with France and with other member states and I am happy to report that they are willing to adapt their national measures as we requested,” Von der Leyen said on Friday.

The World Health Organization, whose officials on Friday warned the coronavirus outbreak in many countries “will get worse before it gets better,” has also warned of global equipment shortages - and fears of exploitative pricing - as resources grow scarce and nations look to slow the virus’s spread on their home turf.

In Italy, the health ministry acknowledged efforts to increase critical care beds with ventilators may fall short of what is needed.

“All regions are increasing the beds in intensive care by 50% and the places in sub intensive care by 100%,” a health ministry source said. “Obviously in regions like Lombardy, if the infection does not stop, this risks not being enough.”

Hamilton, a unit of U.S.-based Hamilton Company, along with Swedish rival Getinge, which makes more than 10,000 ventilators a year, said no single manufacturer could fill Italy’s order alone.

“I don’t think there’s any supplier or med-tech company that would be able to supply 5,000 units just like that,” Getinge spokeswoman Anna Appelqvist said. “It will probably be a mix.”

Getinge’s production was going “full speed,” she said, though reliance on subcontractors for components plays a role in how much it can boost production.

Hamilton’s ventilator plant, in the village of Bonaduz in the Alps, stocked up in January on the components it needs after Wieland heard from Chinese associates of a mysterious new respiratory virus.

“They told me, ‘There’s something quite bad afoot. We don’t know exactly what’s going on, but there’s a virus, and it’s spreading’,” Wieland said. “We bought supplies necessary for about a half a year.”

It Should Share Them.,"But this solidarity seems to be bound by borders. As multiple European countries impose travel restrictions and close their gates, it becomes ever clearer where practical European neighborliness ends. The tough truth is that in this global emergency, while solidarity expands, the idea of “we” shrinks. My country, which takes some pride in being the European Union’s indispensable nation and economic powerhouse, is no exception — as Berlin’s approach to ventilators, Europe’s most wanted machines, shows.

Now is not the time for closing in on ourselves. Europe must step up its efforts, and Germany should lead the way.

Compared with other European states, Germany is by far best equipped to deal with the outbreak. Not only does it have a good number of intensive care beds — around 28,000 — it also possesses 25,000 ventilators, with 10,000 more on the way. France has only around 5,000 ventilators available. Italian hospitals, confronting the world’s most severe coronavirus situation, are already triaging patients, forced by a lack of resources to make excruciating decisions about whom to treat and when. As of Monday, the country’s fatality rate was around 11 percent, with 2,470 dead. In Germany, 13 patients have died.

So Germany has enough ventilators and can — by placing orders with domestic medical supply companies — produce more. And there’s a shortage elsewhere. Wouldn’t European solidarity mean Germany deliver at least some of the new ventilators to countries that currently need them most?

When I asked this question on Twitter, the quickest reaction came from those defending a narrow “we.” “If a German dies because of this, how do you want to explain?” one responded. “Do you want to let our parents and grandparents die?” another replied.",,"['25,000 ventilators', '5,000 ventilators']",,
Germany,04-01-2020 14:25,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/germany-testing-coronavirus,"Widespread Testing, Large Number Of ICU Beds Gave Germany An Upper Hand On Coronavirus","BERLIN (AP) — Late last year — long before most people had heard of the new coronavirus now sweeping the globe — scientists in Germany sprang into action to develop a test for the virus that was causing an unusual respiratory disease in central China.

They had one by mid-January — and labs around the country were ready to start using it just weeks later, around the same time that Europe’s most populous country registered its first case.

“It was clear that if the epidemic swept over here from China, then we had to start testing,” said Hendrik Borucki, a spokesman for Bioscientia Healthcare, which operates 19 labs in Germany.

That quick work stands in stark contrast to delays and missteps in other countries. Coupled with Germany’s large number of intensive care beds and its early social distancing measures, it could explain one of the most interesting puzzles of the COVID-19 pandemic: Why are people with the virus in Germany currently dying at much lower rates than in neighboring countries?

The numbers are remarkable: As confirmed cases in Germany passed 71,000, the death toll Wednesday was 775, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In contrast, Italy has reported almost 106,000 infections and more than 12,400 deaths, while Spain has more than 102,000 cases with over 9,000 deaths.

France has four times as many virus deaths as Germany and Britain has twice as many, even though both countries have fewer reported infections.

There may be many factors at play, but experts said early on that fast and widespread testing gave Germany an edge.

“The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” said virologist Dr. Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the new virus at Berlin’s Charité hospital — established over 300 years ago to treat plague victims.

He estimated that Germany is now capable of conducting up to 500,000 tests a week.

Spain, meanwhile, tests between 105,000 and 140,000 people each week, about 20% to 30% what Germany is capable of. Italy did around 200,000 tests over the past week, but that reflects a significant recent ramp-up.

Early access to the test from Drosten’s team is only part of the reason for Germany’s head start. Before the country even registered its first case, authorities agreed the tests would be covered by its universal insurance system, and be available to everyone with symptoms and either recent travel to virus hotspots or close contact with a confirmed case.

Still, Germany may not be as much of an anomaly as it seems. The fact that Spain and Italy — which have seen much more intense outbreaks — are doing fewer tests indicates they are missing many mild or asymptomatic cases. That makes their fatality rates look worse than they are. But Germany, too, is likely missing cases, and experts say that all figures worldwide undercount the extent of the pandemic.

Limited testing also means the true spread of the virus is hidden in those countries — further fueling the outbreak.

For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to to death.

Ensuring those severely ill patients can be treated properly is key to managing the outbreak — and preventing deaths.

And there again, Germany has an advantage.

Italy had 8.6 intensive care unit beds per 100,000 people before the outbreak, according to the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development. By comparison, Germany’s most recent available figure is 33.9 per 100,000, or about 28,000 in total, a number the government wants to double.

“We are well prepared today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,” said Dr. Uwe Janssens, who heads Germany’s Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine.

Hospitals in the hardest-hit areas of Italy, are now buckling under the weight of treating so many ill patients at once, contributing the country’s death toll — the highest in the world.

In the rare position of having beds to spare, German hospitals have taken in dozens of patients from Italy and France. While that will allow German doctors and nurses to learn how to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients, it also reflects a remarkable confidence in the country’s ability to manage its outbreak at a time when many others are shutting their borders.

The Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s disease control center, has suggested that strong measures imposed almost three weeks ago, including closing schools and restaurants, and later barring more than two people from gathering outside, seem to have slowed the rate of new infections.

Experts have bemoaned that many countries took similar steps too late.

Scientists advising the British government say major social distancing measures are necessary before there are 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people. According to the, albeit imperfect, data available, Italy imposed its lockdown four days after hitting that threshold but Germany’s came a week before that level was reached.

Officials stress Germany is still in an early stage of its outbreak. But Dr. Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said countries that intervene early with aggressive measures should theoretically be able to avoid the tsunami of cases seen in Italy and Spain.

“We were lucky to have had a long time to prepare,” said Dr. Susanne Herold, a specialist for lung infections at the university hospital in Giessen. For weeks, her staff has been installing new ICU beds, training in the use of ventilators and planning for an emergency scenario.

Amid the cautious optimism, there are those who warn against complacency.

Chancellor Angela Merkel — who is herself in isolation after her doctor tested positive — has resisted calls to loosen the lockdown. A top government medical adviser, Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute, said he wouldn’t rule out Germany’s health system reaching its limit, too.

“This is still the calm before the storm,” said Health Minister Jens Spahn.

AD

At the same time, officials in Berlin criticized the United States on Friday over what they said was the diversion of 200,000 masks that were en route from China. One official backtracked from his comments Saturday, making it unclear whether the shipment had gone to the U.S. Officials in Brazil and France, meanwhile, complained that the United States was outbidding them in the global marketplace for critical medical supplies.

AD

At a Friday evening briefing, Trump said he was invoking the DPA again to stop the export of “critical medical items by unscrupulous actors,” whom he did not identify.

The developments underscored the huge pressure the Trump administration faces as coronavirus infections in the United States continue to skyrocket and state officials and health-care workers continue to complain of shortages of medical supplies, at a time when most of the rest of the world also is battling the contagion.

AD

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government has been “forcefully” reminding American counterparts that trade “goes both ways across the border.”

Thousands of nurses in Windsor, Ontario, he noted, travel to Detroit each day to work in hospitals there. Several of them have since tested positive for covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 12,000 people in Michigan.

AD

“These are things that Americans rely on,” Trudeau said, “and it would be a mistake to create blockages or reduce the amount of back-and-forth trade of essential goods and services, including medical goods, across our border.”

President Trump announced late Thursday he was invoking the Defense Production Act in relation to 3M, suggesting it was for punitive reasons. “We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks,” he tweeted. “. . . Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!”

AD

On Friday, Trump added he was “not happy with 3M,” without elaborating.

In an executive order, the White House said it would use the act to acquire “the number of N-95 respirators that the [FEMA] administrator determines to be appropriate.”

3M Chief Executive Michael Roman said the company would comply with the order.

AD

""The narrative we aren’t doing everything we can as a company is just not true,” he said in an interview with CNBC, noting that 3M has doubled its global production of N95 masks since coronavirus hit the headlines in January.

He also cautioned that administration requests to stop mask exports from the United States, and to divert production from other countries, could have serious trade and humanitarian implications.

AD

3M is an important supplier to Canada and Latin America, and “the sole provider in many cases of the respiratory protection for health-care workers in countries around the world,” he said, adding that exports to Canada and Latin America represent a “small proportion” of the company’s U.S. production.

“Ceasing all export of respirators produced in the United States would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same, as some have already done,” 3M said in a statement.

AD

The company said it had “secured approval from China” this week to export 10 million masks to the United States, from 3M’s factories in China. That followed a Trump administration request that 3M increase imports from its overseas factories, the company said.

Presidential trade adviser Peter Navarro said this week that the administration has “had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world — enough of it is coming back here to the right places.”

In February, Navarro complained in an interview with Fox Business that China had moved to “nationalize, effectively, 3M, our company . . . to prevent them from sending us any stuff.”

In response, 3M said it has a “regionalized” manufacturing structure. “For example, the majority of our products made in China are sold in China,” a spokeswoman said.

German officials on Friday were stinging in their criticism of the Trump administration after a consignment of face masks that they said was ordered and paid for by the Berlin police was diverted en route from China. But one of the officials backpedaled from his statement on Saturday.

AD

Andreas Geisel, Berlin’s interior minister, said the delivery made it as far as Bangkok before being “confiscated.” In a statement Friday, he said the masks had been ordered from a U.S. firm and “we are currently assuming that this is related to the U.S. government’s ban on mask exports."" Berlin mayor Michael Müller also weighed in to call the action “inhumane and unacceptable.”

But on Saturday, Geisel wrote on Twitter that he had clarified that the order was placed with a German firm, and that supply-chain issues were being “reviewed.”

AD

German press reports said Friday the consignment was ordered from 3M. 3M later said it had “no evidence” that its products had been seized, as it had “no record of any order of respirators from China for the Berlin police.”

The German federal government did not respond to a request to comment on Friday. The U.S. State Department declined to comment on the complaints from various countries.

In Brazil, the health minister this week said some of the country’s purchases from China fell through after the United States started transporting planeloads of equipment from China.

“The United States has ordered 23 huge airplanes to China to bring back the materials that they’d acquired,” Brazilian health minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta told reporters. “Our purchases — which we expected would bolster supplies — many fell through.”

AD

He said it’s likely that Brazil had been outbid for the supplies, and that the Chinese reneged on the agreements.

Brazil announced Thursday that after distributing the last of its medical supplies, the health ministry’s reserves have now been completely depleted.

“In another week, we won’t have any more masks,” said Alexandre Telles, the president of Rio de Janeiro’s doctors’ union. “Everyone is very scared by the lack of protective equipment.”

In France, a number of regional officials told the Libération newspaper that they had ordered masks from Chinese suppliers, only to be outbid by American officials at the last minute.

“I had found a stock of masks available, but the Americans outbid,” said Valérie Pécresse, the president of the Paris region’s governmental council.

The United States emphatically denied the allegations. “The United States government has not purchased any masks intended for delivery from China to France,” the U.S. Embassy in Paris wrote in a statement. “Reports to the contrary are completely false.”

Turkey,,https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/coronavirus-turkey-faulty-chinese-kits-not-use,Coronavirus: Turkey rejects Chinese testing kits over inaccurate results,"The Turkish government has cast aside a sample of Chinese-made coronavirus rapid testing kits after finding out that they gave inaccurate results, a Turkish official confirmed to Middle East Eye on Friday.

""We have received some samples from the company,"" the official said. ""We didn’t find them viable and ordered some other testing kit models from a separate Chinese company.""

The official did not say how many kits were concerned, while noting that they hadn't yet been used with the wider public.

The news comes as Spain revealed on Thursday that it had withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made kits after realising that they had only 30 percent accuracy. A Czech media outlet also reported that up to 80 percent of the 150,000 portable quick tests that China delivered to the republic earlier this month were faulty.

Spanish officials told the media that the testing kits were also manufactured by the same company that had supplied the Turkish government.

""I cannot confirm whether the ones we received are the same as the ones in Spain,"" the Turkish official added.

'We have tried them. They don't work. Spain has made a huge mistake by using them' - Ates Kara, Turkish health ministry special science board on coronavirus

Turkish Health Minister Fahrettin Koca confirmed later on Friday that Turkey had tried some rapid antigen tests arrived from China, but authorities ""weren't happy about them.""

""We didn't release them for public use,"" he said in a televised presser.

Koca also said that Turkey had received a different and viable testing kits that are based on antibodies from China. ""We have 350,000 of them now,"" he said.

A member of the Turkish health ministry special science board on coronavirus said that the batch of testing kits were only 30 to 35 percent accurate.

""We have tried them. They don't work. Spain has made a huge mistake by using them,"" Professor Ates Kara said on CNNTurk.

Kara said Turkey was among three countries able to produce their own real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests that can give results in six hours.

Coronavirus toll rises

Also on Friday, Turkey announced 16 new deaths from the disease, bringing the total number to 92. Koca said the total number of confirmed infections had reached 5,698, after 7,533 tests were conducted earlier in the day.

He also said that the special science board advised Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to further increase the measures in the country by putting cities in isolation as number of patients in the country has increased 50 percent in a single day.

Meanwhile, around 1,500 foreigners - mainly from Algeria - were taken to a dormitory in northern Turkey after being stranded at Istanbul airport due to the pandemic.

Coronavirus: Turkey quarantines thousands of pilgrims from Saudi Arabia Read More »

Istanbul Airport operator IGA said on Tuesday that the government had tried to persuade the Algerian government to grant landing rights for the affected flights. Algeria has suspended the flights since 19 March.

Since the virus reached Turkey, the government has unleashed an array of measures aimed at curbing its spread, including closing down schools, universities, cafes, congressional prayers, indefinitely postponing sporting events and suspending flights to many countries.

The Interior Ministry also announced that grocery store and supermarket hours would be limited to between 9am and 9pm, with a maximum of one customer for every 10 square metres of shop space.

Turkish authorities have ordered those aged 65 and above and those with chronic illnesses to stay at home, while most public spaces have been temporarily closed.

Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Friday that intercity bus travel would be restricted beginning on midnight as parks, forests and shores would be closed in the weekends to minimise the contagion.","['7,533 tests']",,,

The rapid rise in cases - 18,135 confirmed infections and 356 deaths as of late Thursday - has seen Turkey overtake other G20 states such as South Korea and Canada that reported cases of the virus weeks earlier.

More:

It has also left Turks asking if the country might be following the path of Italy, which has recorded more than 110,000 cases.

""Turkey has the highest acceleration rate for cases,"" said Caghan Kizil, associate professor of neuroscience and genetics at the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres.

""This is because social mobility wasn't prevented. If we look at China, they were successful because they identified asymptomatic patients who weren't showing signs of infection. After the lockdown in Wuhan, the number of cases caused by undocumented infected people dropped significantly.""

Esin Senol, a professor of infectious disease at Gazi University in Ankara, pointed out that Turkey has now seen the world's tenth-highest number of cases and is one of the countries at most risk.

""It appears to have spread long before the first case was reported, due to trips to Europe, Iran and Umrah,"" she said, referring to the Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.

Limiting testing to those who had recently been abroad in the early days of the outbreak in Turkey also allowed the virus to spread, Senol added.

On Thursday evening, Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca announced 79 new deaths. Although the figure is far lower than numbers seen in the worst days in countries like Italy and Spain, where daily death tolls have frequently surpassed 800 recently, it was the sharpest increase yet in Turkey.

In a press conference on Wednesday, Koca revealed for the first time the nature of the spread of the outbreak across Turkey, showing that 60 percent of cases had been reported in Istanbul, the country's commercial hub, which accounts for a fifth of Turkey's population.

Mehmet Ceyhan, chairman of Turkey's Infectious Diseases Association, warned that the country could see its number of infections outstrip others.

""If we go at the current rate, our number of cases will be 300,000 in 10 days,"" he said.

However, closing down public spaces, restricting travel between cities and ensuring people stay at home would avoid such a dramatic scenario.

""I look at the measures that have been implemented, and our people have begun to adapt a little better,"" Ceyhan said.

""If we comply with the measures in the same way, we may see a fall in the rate of increase.""

Shortages

Despite winning praise for its early adoption of restrictions such as border closures, suspending air travel and quarantining those aged over 65, the government has faced criticism over the relatively low number of tests carried out.

Turkey had conducted just under 107,000 tests and only reached a target of carrying out 10,000 a day on Monday.

This compares with more than half a million tests carried out in Italy.

Professional medical groups have highlighted a shortfall in the equipment, beds and health staff needed to deal with larger numbers of coronavirus patients.

""It is evident that hospitals in the city have not prepared adequately in the two and a half months since this deadly virus first came into the spotlight,"" the Istanbul Chamber of Physicians said in a statement.

As well as a shortage of protective gear such as masks and gloves, the chamber also criticised a lack of organisation and improper testing of health workers, noting that more than 100 staff in Istanbul hospitals had tested positive.

According to the government, more than 600 healthcare personnel have been infected across Turkey.

""That's worrying,"" said Kizil. ""The answer to the question of whether we will be like Italy will be determined by how ready our healthcare system is for the high number of cases that appear on the horizon.""

Calls for quarantine

Ankara has resisted calls for a full lockdown, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling for businesses to stay open and keep the economy's ""wheels turning"".

However, the president said Turkey would step up measures if the outbreak continued spreading.

The government has urged people to stay at home; closed schools, cafes and bars; restricted domestic travel; halted international flights; and suspended sporting events and religious gatherings.

The presidency declined to comment on the efficiency of its measures, but Koca on Wednesday defended the government's response and said the health ministry aimed to implement 30,000 tests daily within 10 days.

""We have done everything to create a fighting environment in unity and togetherness from the beginning,"" he said.

""We plan to enhance our resources as much as possible and we are planning what to do in situations, such as plan B, plan C, plan D.""

Senol, the infectious disease specialist, called for more robust testing and isolation policies as well as greater transparency and information sharing.

Turkey should prevent people from mixing outside their homes, Kizil said.

""Turkey is doing the exact opposite of what must be done. This outbreak is in the late stages and we can't be satisfied with early-stage measures like washing hands and practicing social distancing. We need quarantine.""","['30,000 tests', '107,000 tests']",,,
Turkey,,https://ahvalnews.com/coronavirus/turkeys-control-coronavirus-testing-kits-fuels-concerns-over-cover-surgeon,Turkey's control of coronavirus testing kits fuels concerns over cover-up - surgeon,"(Updates with Erdoğan's meeting and measures against virus in ninth,10th and 13th paragraphs)

Turkey's control of coronavirus testing kits is fuelling concerns over a cover-up, a prominent surgeon wrote for The National Interest on Wednesday.

“To date, Turkey has done about 2,500 tests. The lack of any identified cases provoked suspicion because if the test is negative, there was no other way to prove that the test might be positive,” said Dr. Ergin Koçyıldırım, a paediatric cardiothoracic surgeon and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburg’s School of Medicine.

A source at a privately owned hospital in Istanbul told Ahval that the government was controlling the distribution of kits and not allowing hospitals to independently order alternatives.

Turkey has said its own virus detection kits are the fastest and most accurate in the world. While most detection kits generally yield results in around 24 hours, the Turkish government said its kits - produced in Turkey by a private company and funded by the state - can produce results in 90 minutes.

Despite the Health Ministry’s claims that Turkish coronavirus detection kits have been exported to several countries, including the United States, Koçyıldırım said that - to his knowledge - there was not a single institution or lab in that country using the tests.

Koçyıldırım also said that the Turkish government’s censorship of information was preventing people receiving reliable information on the coronavirus and was a disaster waiting to happen.

Turkey is the world’s biggest jailer of journalists and has threatened to take legal action against social media users or journalists who criticise its coronavirus detection approach, said Koçyıldırım.

“Turkey has an ongoing economic crisis and relies on tourism revenue. If tourists are going to stop visiting Turkey, this year the economy might collapse. This could also be one of the reasons for not reporting a positive case for such a long period,” said Koçyıldırım.

After weeks of growing concerns among Turks about the growing threat posed by the virus and less than two days after the first case was reported in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called a cabinet meeting on Thursday to discuss additional measures against the virus.

Meanwhile, an aide to Erdoğan used a thermal camera to check people for fever who met the president during a visit to parliament on Wednesday, Reuters said.

Turkish authorities took early precautions such as thermal screening at airports, closing the border with Iran, and suspending air travel to China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea. But the lack of previously identified cases triggered suspicion among many, because Turkey is a major tourism destination and regional transit hub, and shares a border with Iran, one of the countries hit hardest by the virus.

When Health Minister Fahrettin Koca did announce on Wednesday that Turkey’s first coronavirus patient had been identified, he resisted responding to questions by the media by claiming that this would violate the patient's privacy.

After Wednesday’s announcement, the government ramped up further measures to control the spread of the virus, banning all public gatherings at schools and indefinitely cancelling leave for military personnel. The municipality in Istanbul, where the first case was detected, has cancelled all shows at city theatres, banned visits to museums, and halted vocational courses.

The tense relations and a lack of cooperation between the government and the Turkish Medical Association (TMA) - an independent medical and health professional association that aims to protect and promote public health in Turkey - could also be a problematic factor in informing the public about the virus, wrote Koçyıldırım.

“Despite their efforts to collaborate during the coronavirus outbreak, TMA reports that there has not been any government response yet,” he said.

Koçyıldırım said trust in government institutions was essential for advising the public and disseminating vital information. “Turkish citizens will have to contend with these problems [of trust] as they navigate the coronavirus crisis,” he said.","['2,500 tests']",,,

In the conversation, the Iranian Foreign Minister expressed sympathy with the Turkish government and people over the outbreak of coronavirus in Turkey, and voiced the Islamic Republic of Iran’s readiness for whatever assistance and cooperation necessary in the fight against COVID-19.

The two top diplomats also discussed the bilateral cooperation between Tehran and Ankara in the fields of transportation and transit of goods.

Earlier, Iran’s highest-ranking military commander had expressed the Iranian Armed Forces’ preparedness to share their experiences in the battle with the novel coronavirus with the military forces of Turkey.

Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces Major General Mohammad Hossein Baqeri made the comments in a phone conversation with Turkey’s Minister of National Defense Hulusi Akar on Monday evening.

In the talks, the top Iranian commander said the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran are ready to share their experiences in the battle with COVID-19 with the military forces of Turkey and other countries.

Highlighting Iran’s successful plans to contain the spread of the coronavirus by taking advantage of the military forces, Major General Baqeri said more than one million volunteer members of Basij have rushed to help the medical society in the fight against the disease.

He also noted that the Iranian Armed Forces have launched extensive plans to offer medical services amid the outbreak of the coronavirus, carry out scientific research, and produce medical supplies.

The commander also noted that the Iranian military forces have so far treated 8,000 coronavirus patients, prepared 3,000 hospital beds and 11,000 beds in convalescent homes, and dispatched special units to 3,000 locations across the country to clean and disinfect the public places.

Turkey,,https://www.trtworld.com/turkey/why-turkey-is-better-equipped-to-tackle-coronavirus-34610,Why Turkey is better-equipped to tackle coronavirus,"Insight

The country has the highest ICU bed capacity per 100,000 people compared to European countries, the US and China.

As the world continues to be gripped by panic because of the coronavirus pandemic, each affected country has had almost a similar response to the crisis.

While social distancing has been the first advisory almost all countries have issued, the global powers such as the US and several European countries are facing intense scrutiny over the sufficiency of their healthcare services, which play a vital role in containing the virus.

As we break down, some essential components of healthcare infrastructure show how Turkey is better equipped than the US and many European countries.

ICU capacity

The intensive care unit, also known as the intensive treatment unit, is a special branch of hospitals where patients in critical conditions receive life support and 24/7 medical scrutiny.

Turkey has the highest ICU bed capacity per 100,000 people compared to most European countries, the US and China.

In Turkey, there are nearly 46 ICU beds per 100,000 people, according to 2018 data of the Turkish Ministry of Health, while the US has 34.7 and Germany has 29.2.

Public and university hospitals have 58 percent of critical care beds while private hospitals have 42 percent of this capacity.

However, the ICU bed numbers will rise because of the inauguration of big city hospital projects in the last two years.

Italy, the most severely affected European country from coronavirus, has 12.5 critical care beds for every 100,000 people. On the other hand, the number is 11.6 for France, 6.6 for the UK and below five in Portugal.

In South Korea, the critical bed number per 100,000 is 10.6 while Japan has 9.7 and China has 3.6.

In Europe, detected cases have already passed 50,000 which also increased the number of people in critical condition.

Doctor number

Doctors and healthcare workers take on the most critical roles in fighting against the outbreak. At this time, in many countries, they work day and night with great effort and self-sacrifice.

The number of doctors varies from country to country. Austria has the most doctors in proportion to its population, it has 5.2 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report for 2018.

Germany has also a good score in this respect by having 4.3 doctors per 1,000 people, while Italy has four.

When it comes to Turkey, despite having the most critical care infrastructure in the world, the number of doctors per inhabitant is about 1.8 per 1,000. The number of healthcare workers is twice that of doctors in the country.

General bed capacity

Japan and South Korea are the most advantageous countries in the world in terms of bed capacity in hospitals. Japan has 13.1 beds per a thousand people while South Korea has 12.3.

Total bed capacity is another important factor in the current crisis. The medium of OECD countries’ bed capacity per 1,000 is 4.5, while the EU countries it is 5.1.

For the leading EU countries, such as Germany, France, and Italy, ratios are 8.0, 6.0 and 3.2, respectively.

The number of beds per 1,000 inhabitants is about 2.8 in Turkey, where public hospitals have 75 percent of the total bed capacity.

Turkey’s foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu dismissed as “an ugly accusation” reports that Turkey sought to confiscate the shipment of life-saving ventilators crucial for treating the most severe Covid-19 cases.

“We have authorised the export of 116 ventilators to Spain following the instructions of the health ministry, and they will be sent to Spain in the coming days,” he said, according to the official Anadolu News Agency.

The supplies are reportedly worth €3m (£2.4m).

“Thank you, Turkey, for authorising the export of Turkish respirators,” Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya wrote on Twitter late Saturday, hours after publicly criticising Ankara. “We appreciate the gesture of a friend and ally.”

The coronavirus pandemic has unleashed a global scramble for medical equipment, with governments accused of confiscating shipments of personal protective equipment and ventilators destined for other countries in what some are describing as outright piracy. Tunisia last month accused Italy of seizing a shipment of medical alcohol bound for the north African country.

The Trump administration has been accused of the most egregious offences, including swiping shipments destined for Germany, France and Canada for its own use, and withholding or even seizing supplies destined for use in American states politically hostile to him, his oligarchic allies and the agenda of his evangelical Christian supporters.

Ventilators are crucial to keep alive patients so sickened by Covid-19 that they are unable to breathe on their own. The ones reportedly held up by Turkey were purchased by the Spanish regions of Navarra in the north and Castille-La Mancha east of Madrid to address one of the most deadly outbreaks of coronavirus in the world. Spain has recorded 12,418 deaths and 130,759 confirmed infections, second worldwide only to Italy.

Just days earlier, Turkey shipped plane loads of medical equipment to Spain and Italy, both Nato partners. But Turkey too has begun to experience the accelerating impact of Covid-19, reporting at least 425 deaths and 20,921 cases. Medical practitioners in major cities have begun describing overwhelmed emergency rooms and intensive care wards.

On Friday, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced tightened restrictions, including requiring masks at supermarkets and barring anyone under 20 years old or over 65 from leaving their homes.

Exports of all medical supplies now require the authorisation of the ministry of health, a layer of bureaucracy which Turks say held up the shipment of the Spanish-bound ventilators, which included parts from both Turkey and China.

Significant Shortage Projected for Hospital Beds, ICU Beds, and Ventilators

'Unequivocally evident that social distancing can help control the trajectory of the pandemic'

SEATTLE, April 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- New COVID-19 estimates find that, among European nations, the peak daily death rate from the pandemic will occur during the third week of April, with the pandemic spreading from Southern Europe.

The new forecasts, released today by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine, find that approximately 151,680 people will die during what researchers are calling the ""first wave"" of the pandemic. By comparison, the US is expected to face 81,766 deaths, according to forecasts released on Sunday by IHME.

""We are expecting a foreboding few weeks for people in many parts of Europe,"" said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray. ""It seems likely the number of deaths will exceed our projections for the United States.""

This is despite the declines in deaths that are now occurring in Italy and Spain.

The death toll in many countries is compounded by demand for hospital resources well in excess of what is available. For example, peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds needed compared to 17,765 available, 24,544 ICU beds compared to 799 ICU beds available, and 20,862 ventilators needed (with data currently unavailable on ventilators available).

Today's announcement on Europe finds that most regions of Italy and Spain have passed their peaks in the number of deaths, while other nations are approaching their peaks and still others facing peak mortality later in April.

Countries that are about to peak or are quickly approaching peak in this wave of the epidemic include The Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, and Luxembourg. The Czech Republic and Romania are midway through their expected trajectories. Other nations including the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, and Greece are still early in their trajectories and face fast-rising death tolls through their peaks in the second and third weeks of April.

""It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,"" Murray said. ""Those nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation's trajectory will change – and dramatically for the worse – if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.""

Murray cautioned that easing these precautions too soon during the first wave of the pandemic could lead to new rounds of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. He defines the end of this ""wave"" as a ratio of 0.3 deaths per 1 million people. IHME's projections assume that social distancing measures, if not currently implemented, will be implemented within one week.

""To decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass produced, and distributed widely,"" Murray said.

IHME started making projections of the pandemic's impact in the United States state-by-state on March 26. Today's announcement is the first set of predictions for European nations and is based on modeling the peak in death rates and hospital usage in Wuhan City in China, where the virus was first discovered, as well as data from seven European locations that have peaked, including Madrid, Spain; Castile-La Mancha, Spain; Tuscany, Italy; Emilia-Romagna, Italy; Liguria, Italy; Piedmont, Italy; and Lombardy, Italy.

Of these eight locations that have reached the peak regarding daily deaths, only one, Wuhan, has currently brought new cases to nearly zero.

The analysis is based on an extensive range of information and data sources, including:

Local governments, national governments, and the World Health Organization

Government declarations on implementation of social distancing policies

Age-specific death rate data from China , Italy , South Korea , and the US

Here are some country-specific findings from IHME's latest forecasting:

Italy donated medical equipment to China at the onset of the coronavirus, but when the virus hit the European nation, China put a price tag on the same PPE and forced Italy to buy it back, according to an unnamed senior Trump official who spoke with the Spectator.

""Before the virus hit Europe, Italy sent tons of PPE to China to help China protect its own population. China then has sent Italian PPE back to Italy — some of it, not even all of it ... and charged them for it,"" the Trump administration official said.

China said in March it would donate medical supplies to Italy, which has faced more than 130,000 cases of the coronavirus and over 16,500 deaths.

The official continued, “It’s so disingenuous for Chinese officials now to say we are the ones who are helping the Italians or we are the ones who are helping the developing world when, in fact, they are the ones who infected all of us. Of course they should be helping. They have a special responsibility to help because they are the ones who began the spread of the coronavirus and did not give the information required to the rest of the world to plan accordingly.”

China has sold nearly 4 billion face masks to other countries grappling with the coronavirus, according to Agence France-Presse. The outlet detailed that China has exported 3.86 million masks, 37.5 million pieces of PPE, 16,000 ventilators, and 2.84 million testing kits since March 1. The orders were shipped to more than 50 foreign nations, and customs official Jin Hai told Agence France-Presse the exports were valued at about $1.4 billion.

Some of the medical supplies were even rejected for inadequate standards by the foreign nations, including thousands of test kits sent to Spain that were found to be faulty and 600,000 face masks in the Netherlands that were recalled.

“The disinformation that China has put out is crippling responses around the world. We were a month behind because the Chinese did not share information,” the official told the Spectator. “It’s hard for the world to accept that even the information that they’re putting out now is accurate and acceptable from an epidemiological standpoint. We’re operating on some level with a hand tied behind our back.”",,"['16,000 ventilators']",,
South Africa,,https://qz.com/africa/1832066/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-in-south-africa-leads-continent/,South Africa is leading the continent’s coronavirus testing challenge boosted by private labs,"As South Africa ramps up its Covid-19 testing, other African countries are being left behind and do not know the extent of the novel coronavirus’ spread among their people.

South Africa has had one of the speediest and most forceful responses to the Covid-19 pandemic—it decided to shut down its borders and put residents into physical lockdown before it announced its first death from Covid-19, a respiratory disease that has caused more than 50,000 deaths worldwide.

As of April 3, South Africa had recorded 1,462 cases and five deaths, from coronavirus. Africa has had 6,860 cases and 269 deaths, the numbers are still relatively low compared with Europe and the United States.

Countries which were slow to react are seeing some of the highest numbers of deaths due to the disease. The United States, which now has the highest number of confirmed cases, has still not instituted a national lockdown.

Earlier this week, the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.”

South Africa is in the throes of a mass testing campaign, with plans to increase its surveillance. Its large health research and disease-tracing machinery, honed by years of coping with its HIV epidemic, has swung into action, driving testing and surveillance.

To date, it has tested more than 47,000 people, although experts and health officials say that much more needs to be done to try and isolate infected individuals. Head of the Medical Research Council Glenda Gray told Quartz Africa that the country should be testing about 25,000 people a day. “We’re far behind.”

Much of the concern about the impact of coronavirus on Sub Saharan Africa has centered around what the WHO has described as the region’s “fragile health systems”. But in South Africa, the continent’s most advanced economy but also one of the most unequal in the world, the vast majority of cases have been tested by private laboratories, as opposed to state facilities.

South Africa has a two-tiered healthcare system, with wealthier individuals opting for private healthcare and poorer residents reliant on state services. The first cases of Covid-19 were reported in people returning from other countries, and people in this income bracket in South Africa tend to have medical aid and visit private rather than public healthcare facilities.

In the face of increasing local transmission—and the threat of Covid-19 spreading to the majority of the country, who are not able to afford private healthcare or testing—the National Health Laboratory Service has said that by the end of April, it will be able to process approximately 36,000 tests in 24 hours.

But other countries in the region do not have these sorts of resources. On April 2, Zimbabwe had tested only 316 people for the virus, and had nine positive cases and one death. It declared a national lockdown on Mar. 29. In Namibia, whose testing is done locally and in South Africa, there have been 306 tests, and 11 confirmed Covid-19 cases.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control says that testing capacity at its laboratories has increased to 1,500 tests a day, but a recent report found that by Mar. 22 Nigeria had only tested 152 people. There are currently 190 cases in the country, although experts fear that there are many more.

Dr Matshidiso Moeti, Africa regional director of WHO, told a press briefing on Thursday. A serious challenge for many countries in the region is the availability of testing kits.

At the moment, many test kits are being donated to African countries from philanthropic individuals, such as Alibaba’s Jack Ma, and overseas governments; or distributed by the African Union.

In its initial stages, the spread of the pandemic seemed to have by-passed many African countries. Now that the virus is spreading locally, countries’ struggling healthcare systems are already showing their weaknesses—and that is before the number of severely sick people begins to multiply.

Health experts stress that the best way to slow the spread of the virus is through extensive testing, the quick quarantine of people who are positive, and tracking who those people came into contact with.

“We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization and a former Ethiopian health minister, said recently.

South Africa has begun doing just that with mobile testing units and screening centers established in the country’s most densely populated township areas, where an estimated 25 percent of the country’s 57 million people live.

Clad in protective gear, medical workers operate a mobile testing unit in Johannesburg’s poor Yeoville area. In the windswept dunes of Cape Town’s Khayelitsha township, centers have been erected where residents are screened and those deemed at risk are tested.

While most people who become infected have mild or moderate symptoms, the disease can be particularly dangerous for older people and those with existing health problems, such as those whose immune systems are weakened or who have lung issues. That means many in South Africa — with world’s largest number of people with HIV, more than 8 million, and one of the world’s highest levels of TB, which affects the lungs — are at high risk of getting more severe cases of the disease.

“Social distancing is almost impossible when a large family lives in a one-room shack. Frequent hand-washing is not practical when a hundred families share one tap,” said Denis Chopera, executive manager of the Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence.

“These are areas where there are high concentrations of people with HIV and TB who are at risk for severe symptoms. These are areas that can quickly become hot spots,” said Chopera, a virologist based in Durban.

But years of fighting those scourges has endowed South Africa with a network of testing sites and laboratories in diverse communities across the country that may help it cope, say experts.

“We have testing infrastructure, testing history and expertise that is unprecedented in the world,” said Francois Venter, deputy director of the Reproductive Health Institute at the University of Witswatersrand. “It is an opportunity that we cannot afford to squander.”

The country imposed a three-week lockdown March 27 that bought it some time, said Venter.

“Now is the time to test and track. We must get out into the community and find out where the hot spots are,” said the doctor. “With testing we can strategically focus our resources.”

South Africa was one of only two countries in Africa that could test for the new coronavirus when it began its global spread in January. Now at least 43 of the continent’s 54 countries can, but many have limited capacity.

Widespread testing has even been a challenge in North America and Europe, where some countries with large outbreaks resorted to only testing patients who are hospitalized.

Currently able to conduct 5,000 tests per day, South Africa will increase its capacity to more than 30,000 per day by the end of the April, according to the National Health Laboratory Service.

That would make its capacity among the best in Africa and comparable to many countries in the developed world, say health experts.

At first in South Africa, COVID-19 appeared to be a disease of the rich, as the first few hundred cases were virtually all people who had traveled to Italy and France and who could afford to go to private clinics.

But as local transmission of the virus takes hold, the public health service must take testing into the country’s most vulnerable areas: the overcrowded, under-resourced townships.

South Africa has thousands of community health workers experienced in reaching out in these areas to educate about infectious diseases as well as to screen, test and track contacts to try to contain the spread.

South Africa is already testing by taking swabs and using conventional means.

And it is also expecting to receive new kits that will allow rapid test results. South Africa has for several years been using a TB testing system that extracts genetic material and produces results within two hours. That system, known as GeneXpert, has developed a test for COVID-19 that was approved last month by the US Food and Drug Administration and South Africa is expecting delivery of those test kits within weeks.

“This will dramatically shorten our testing time and the smaller machines can be placed in mobile vehicles, which are ideal for community testing,” said Dr. Kamy Chetty, CEO of the National Health Laboratory Service.

South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the country must find out “what is happening in our densely populated areas, in particular the townships” where he said health workers would “continue to venture forth in full combat by proactively conducting wall-to-wall testing and find all COVID-19 affected people in the country.”","['5,000 tests']",,,
South Africa,,https://businesstech.co.za/news/government/387851/south-africa-is-not-doing-enough-coronavirus-testing-heres-what-government-plans-to-do-about-it/,South Africa is not doing enough coronavirus testing – here’s what government plans to do about it,"Testing for Covid-19 in South Africa will hopefully be massively increased in the next few weeks. A machine called the GeneXpert, currently used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), will be used by the state to test for coronavirus.

Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize has expressed concern that not enough testing is being done. “Our testing criteria are reactive and restrictive. This means we don’t have a true picture,” he has said in his daily briefing on the Covid-19 epidemic.

South Africa had conducted over 50,000 tests by 4 April. This compares well to, say, Brazil which has conducted about the same number of tests but has a much bigger population. But our capacity is far behind Australia (nearly 300,000 tests), South Korea (over 460,000 tests) and most European countries.

Also, in the early stages of the epidemic here it was clear who to target: people with symptoms of Covid-19 who were returning from overseas. Now it is much less obvious and we risk missing outbreaks unless we can do much more testing in many more communities.

The GeneXpert, developed by an American company called Cepheid, is key to this. The smallest version of the machine is the size of a desktop computer. It takes four cartridges, where each cartridge is loaded up with sputum from a patient and chemical reagents which allow the machine to detect genetic material of TB, or now coronavirus. It takes 45 minutes to give a result.

As of 2017, South Africa had 314 of these machines. Most have four or 16 cartridges, but there are some with 48 or even 80 cartridges. 180 of the machines will be used for Covid-19.

Prof Bavesh Kana, director of the Centre of Excellence in Biomedical Tuberculosis Research, said the GeneXpert is a safe, fast and easy to use system.

He explained that a health worker takes a sample from the patient and puts it into the cartridge. Within the cartridge the genetic material of the coronavirus is released, but it is safe because it is a closed system.

“The RNA of the virus is converted into DNA. This needs to be done because it is a DNA test. Then certain regions of the genetic material are identified during the test. If the genetic identification is made, the test will be positive,” Kana explained.

The tests can be done in some of the mobile laboratories that the health department is rolling out, though electricity is needed.

The Covid-19 test chemical reagents are due to arrive in the country this month.

While this is all good news, Cepheid has come under US-based activist organisation Treatment Action Group (not to be confused with the local Treatment Action Campaign). It has demanded that Cepheid should immediately lower the cost of its cartridges to $5 each for developing countries.

“By pricing its Covid-19 test at $20 for developing countries — twice the current price of the same cartridge when used to diagnose TB — Cepheid gives the appearance of profiteering at a time when the most widespread possible use of the test could help to slow the spread of the pandemic and reduce the number of deaths in these countries,” said Mark Harrington, the organisation’s Executive Director.

Another concern is that using the machines for Covid-19 will impede TB testing. Asked about this Kana said: “The GeneXperts are very effective and they can run for 24 hours, if needed. It is also very early in the pandemic, and it is hard to say now, how the system will respond.”

Beyond the GeneXpert, laboratory capacity is also being increased. Dr Kamy Chetty, Chief Executive Officer, of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) said they currently have six laboratories where Covid-19 tests are done.

By late April this will be increased to nine. The mobile laboratories will bring patient samples to these facilities. Most tests are still being done in the private sector.

Currently the country can do about 5,000 tests in 24 hours. Later this month it will increase to 15,000 and by the end of April to 36,000. At least that is the plan. The proof will be in the execution.

Minister Mkhize is also hoping that antibody tests will be useable in South Africa soon. These can be done by nurses at a clinic or hospital, are usually much cheaper than lab tests and give results in less than 20 minutes.

But they have a shortcoming.

Because they test for antibodies, not the virus directly, a person who has been infected and recovered will test positive. A further lab test that checks directly for the virus would then need to be conducted to see if they are still infected (and infectious). Also it can take 10 to 14 days from infection for antibodies to develop.

Nevertheless, antibody tests, when they eventually are used, will help surveillance of the epidemic and contribute to our understanding of it in South Africa.

Myanmar confirmed its first two cases on March 23, in two people who had travelled to the United States and the United Kingdom, but that number has now climbed to 14.

More:

Andrew Tatem, an epidemiologist at the University of Southampton, said it was ""quite likely"" the virus arrived in Myanmar earlier.

""The countries surrounding Myanmar reported cases ... much earlier, and there is usually substantial mobility in the region,"" he said via email, adding that more widespread testing would be expected to find more cases.

Myanmar shares a 2,000-kilometre-long (1,243 miles) border with China, crossed by an estimated 10,000 workers on a daily basis. Before they were stopped, the country also had direct flights to Wuhan, the city where the pandemic first began.

Slow off the mark

Myanmar has also been slow to institute widespread testing, with only 517 people tested as of the end of March. Even this low number is a marked increase, given that Myanmar had tested less than 150 people by March 18. It was only on March 20 that the health minister announced a new policy to test for anybody with symptoms, not just recent travellers.

""To find 10 cases from 300 tests suggests that there are many more cases out there and scaling up testing should be a priority to get on top of the virus spread and guide response,"" Tatem said.

The United Nations has announced a plan to donate 50,000 testing kits to Myanmar, supplementing previous donations of 3,000 from Singapore and 5,000 from South Korea.

Khin Khin Gyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, admitted it was possible the virus arrived in Myanmar earlier, but said a certain percentage of those cases would presumably have been ""severe"" and therefore would have come to the government's attention.

Joshua Poole, country director for Catholic Relief Services Myanmar, agreed that if there were widespread cases across the country, the news would be circulating on social media. Poole also chairs the Steering Committee of the International NGO Forum in Myanmar and has sat in on virtual meetings between the WHO, UN, and Ministry of Health.

""We're having some challenges in terms of getting more tests out there. In my perspective, it seems like the government is doing everything they can. Obviously, there are some challenges, and there certainly seems to be some delays, but I'm actually quite impressed with what the ministry is able to do,"" he said in a recent interview.

Others, like independent analyst David Mathieson, are less impressed.

""The public health system in Myanmar is woefully unsuited to responding to a pandemic on this scale, so it will be hard to assess how long COVID-19 has been in the country and how many people have perished but had deaths recorded under other causes,"" he said.

Mathieson said the government was slow to respond due to a ""toxic mixture of incompetence, a culture of denial, and ultra-nationalist bluster.""

Health Minister Myint Htwe set the unrealistic goal of zero cases and zero deaths, while government spokesman Zaw Htay said Myanmar was protected by its lifestyle, diet, and lack of credit cards.

While Myanmar did begin to take action once cases were confirmed, Mathieson is worried the government lost more than a month's worth of time.

Return from Thailand

Tens of thousands of migrant workers returned from Thailand last week as the borders were closed, which Tatem said has ""the potential to seed outbreaks across the country if there are not local outbreaks occurring already"".

The migrants crowded across the border before boarding buses with the general population and dispersing throughout the country.

Khin Khin Gyi said the government had ""planned a lot"" for the return of migrants from Thailand.

""We had social distancing at the immigration counter, a medical declaration form, we took their names and residences in the country,"" she said.

She added that local authorities were informed of their whereabouts so they can ""watch"" returnees, and soon the government will implement community quarantine measures and violators will face legal action. ""Some people do not follow the home quarantine,"" she said.

But locals and activists working with migrants said the government response had been unsatisfactory.

Alexa Bay, director of anti-trafficking group Daughters Rising, said migrant workers belatedly heard about self-isolation policies from local news.

""They have not heard anything from the government,"" she said.

Wahkushee Tenner, a Karen activist, said the chaotic return had put the migrants and local population at risk.

""These people are at the most risk of being infected if anyone among this big crowd is infected. It's really putting the local community at high risk where there is no test available, and most of these workers came from poor and remote areas,"" she said in a message.

Tenner said the government does not have the capacity to contain the virus, and criticised the military for being too ""busy bombing and killing in Rakhine State and other ethnic areas.""

""In a global epidemic situation it would be good to see the end of offensives against ethnic people,"" she said.

Those living in Myanmar's makeshift camps for people displaced by civil conflict are also bracing for a possible crisis. Human Rights Watch called the camps, which are home to an estimated 350,000 people, ""COVID-19 tinderboxes"".

""Years of conflict, neglect, and abusive policies by Myanmar's government and military have left hundreds of thousands of displaced people sitting in the path of a public health catastrophe,"" said HRW's Asia Director Brad Adams in a statement.

'Knife's edge'

Myanmar's poor also face the difficult choice between potentially exposing themselves to the virus, or taking an income hit they simply cannot afford.

""Many Myanmar people live on a knife's edge of livelihoods and food security,"" said Mathieson. ""Myanmar's poor will be the ones who suffer the most from any pandemic, and any extended shutdown without significant government and private food supplies and sustainability will drive many communities to desperation.""

Even as restaurants and bars across Yangon shut down over the weekend, taxi drivers continued calling out to the rare pedestrians on the street, offering rides.

They said they knew the risk, but felt they had no other choice. ""If I don't drive, I don't eat,"" said one.

Bay works with domestic workers who feel the same way.

""Some of the girls who are domestic workers think that their job is risky now, and they are worried that they come in contact with people that have the virus ... but they don't feel they can refuse because they are afraid they will be fired,"" she said.",['300 tests'],,,

Myanmar’s largest pharmaceutical distribution company donated a new COVID-19 testing machine to the country’s health ministry on Sunday that can run more than 1,400 tests per day, a major increase from the government’s current testing capacity of around 80 tests per day.

The donation is one of many by conglomerates in the country, as companies have donated medical supplies such as masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as money to support the government in combatting the spread of COVID-19.

On Sunday, AA Medical Products Limited made a donation worth nearly US$590,000 to the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS), including a device that can quickly analyze coronavirus tests and funds to renovate the National Health Laboratory’s (NHL) Virology Lab. The company also donated enough reagents—the chemical compounds used to run the tests—to test over 1,100 people.

An MOHS spokesperson said the new donated machine—a Swiss-made Cobas 6800 medical analyzer—is a very recent model and will allow Myanmar to run many more tests than its current capacity of 80 people per day.

Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw, the director-general and new spokesperson for the MOHS, told The Irrawaddy on Monday that they will be able to test more than 1,400 people per day with the new machine.

“The machine can quickly and efficiently test 380 people at a time and we will have three shifts per day at Yangon’s NHL,” said Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw. The machine is still on its way to Myanmar and is now at the airport in Frankfurt, Germany.

As of Sunday, Myanmar has tested 1,246 people for COVID-19, according to Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw, of which 21 tested positive and one died last week.

The NHL currently provides testing only to those who meet specific criteria, due to limited laboratory capacity.

“We won’t test everyone, unless they fall under the respective criteria, but we will prepare to take their swabs if they show symptoms,” he added. People in Myanmar have voiced concerns on social media that some people in home quarantine, including health care workers, who had close contact with COVID-19 patients have not yet been tested.

Across the country, 70 health care workers are currently under 14-day quarantine.

The NHL in Yangon is currently the only place that can conduct tests but the government is preparing another lab, located in Mandalay, to meet the biosafety standards necessary to conduct testing.

Dr. Saw Nay Nwe, director of AA Medical Products Limited as well as Pacific AA Group, posted on Facebook that “The analyzer and reagent have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), and immediately after this approval, we’ve tried to import these products to Myanmar.”

She added her sincere thanks to Roche Diagnostics, the manufacturer of the testing machine, for prioritizing their order “over the requests of other, developed countries.”

The company also made a donation worth US$35,000 to MOHS and the Central Committee on Prevention, Control and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease on March 15.

Last week, Kanbawza (KBZ) Bank also donated nearly $1 million-worth of medical supplies and protective equipment for hospital staff.

The Southeast Asian nation had been the most populous country in the world to say it had no cases, despite sharing a long and porous border with China, where the virus originated in the city of Wuhan.

The health ministry said a 36-year-old traveling from the United States and 26-year-old returning from Britain, both Myanmar nationals, had tested positive.

“Investigation is ongoing on history of people who have been in contact with these two patients,” it said in a statement late on Monday.

The news of the confirmed cases sparked panic buying in the commercial capital of Yangon, with shoppers packing major supermarkets.

Myanmar last week closed land borders and banned mass gatherings, including for the upcoming Buddhist New Year. Cinemas have been closed, though bars and restaurants remain open.

Government spokesman Zaw Htay told a news conference earlier this month that the “lifestyle and diet of Myanmar citizens” had protected the country against the virus, while others credited the country’s Buddhist religion.

Some doctors say they fear a major outbreak though in a country with a health system ranked among the world’s worst after decades of neglect under military rule. Many services are run by volunteers and aid groups.

Two doctors told Reuters a likely explanation for the lack of cases in Myanmar was limited testing. Myanmar had carried out around 300 tests as of Monday evening, in a population of 51 million, according to health ministry spokeswoman Khin Khin Gyi.

“WHO has said, ‘test, test, test,” she said. “But who should we test? It has said specifically that we should test the suspected cases... We don’t test random people.”

Until recently, each test had to be approved by a central committee based in the capital of Naypyitaw, she said.

Thousands of migrant workers have returned to villages across the country in recent days from Thailand, which has confirmed hundreds of cases, raising fears of further spread of the virus.

“If these people have the virus, and it spreads widely, the situation will be very bad,” said Kyaw Ko Ko, a community worker from the city of Meiktila. “All we can do is sit and wait to collect all the dead bodies.”",['300 tests'],,,

Myanmar’s largest private bank, Kanbawza (KBZ) Bank, airlifted in hospital supplies from China as part of a 1.4 billion-kyat (nearly US$1 million) donation to Myanmar’s health ministry for use in combatting COVID-19.

Some conglomerates in Myanmar are supporting the government in the fight against the coronavirus by donating medical supplies such as masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as money.

KBZ Bank Deputy Chief Executive Director Nang Lang Kham gave the supplies to Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) Deputy Director-General Dr. Tun Myint at the Yangon International Airport last Friday.

The supplies included 23,000 sets of PPE and 700,000 surgical masks, as well as hand gel, thermometers, N-95 masks, safety googles, foot covers and gloves.

KBZ Bank transported some supplies across the China-Myanmar border in the last week of March, but to fulfill the urgent need in Myanmar, the bank also chartered a Myanmar Airways International plane to airlift supplies from Guangzhou, China.

The bank also donated 600,000 surgical masks and 3,000 sets of PPE that it imported from China through the Muse border checkpoint in Shan State between March 27 and Friday.

On March 18, KBZ bank and its counterpart, KBZ MS General Insurance, donated 100 million kyats (over US$71,000) to MOHS for COVID-19 treatment.

Myanmar so far has 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Sunday, including one patient with nasal cancer who died last week.

MOHS spokesman Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw told The Irrawaddy that the government is doing its best to prepare hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients, in case Myanmar has more confirmed cases in the near future.

“Whether these donated supplies will be enough for treatment is hard to tell, as we don’t know yet how many more patients we will have,” he said on Monday.

Myanmar’s largest pharmaceutical distribution company donated a new COVID-19 testing machine to the country’s health ministry on Sunday that can run more than 1,400 tests per day, a major increase from the government’s current testing capacity of around 80 tests per day.

The donation is one of many by conglomerates in the country, as companies have donated medical supplies such as masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as money to support the government in combatting the spread of COVID-19.

On Sunday, AA Medical Products Limited made a donation worth nearly US$590,000 to the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS), including a device that can quickly analyze coronavirus tests and funds to renovate the National Health Laboratory’s (NHL) Virology Lab. The company also donated enough reagents—the chemical compounds used to run the tests—to test over 1,100 people.

An MOHS spokesperson said the new donated machine—a Swiss-made Cobas 6800 medical analyzer—is a very recent model and will allow Myanmar to run many more tests than its current capacity of 80 people per day.

Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw, the director-general and new spokesperson for the MOHS, told The Irrawaddy on Monday that they will be able to test more than 1,400 people per day with the new machine.

“The machine can quickly and efficiently test 380 people at a time and we will have three shifts per day at Yangon’s NHL,” said Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw. The machine is still on its way to Myanmar and is now at the airport in Frankfurt, Germany.

As of Sunday, Myanmar has tested 1,246 people for COVID-19, according to Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw, of which 21 tested positive and one died last week.

The NHL currently provides testing only to those who meet specific criteria, due to limited laboratory capacity.

“We won’t test everyone, unless they fall under the respective criteria, but we will prepare to take their swabs if they show symptoms,” he added. People in Myanmar have voiced concerns on social media that some people in home quarantine, including health care workers, who had close contact with COVID-19 patients have not yet been tested.

Across the country, 70 health care workers are currently under 14-day quarantine.

The NHL in Yangon is currently the only place that can conduct tests but the government is preparing another lab, located in Mandalay, to meet the biosafety standards necessary to conduct testing.

Dr. Saw Nay Nwe, director of AA Medical Products Limited as well as Pacific AA Group, posted on Facebook that “The analyzer and reagent have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), and immediately after this approval, we’ve tried to import these products to Myanmar.”

She added her sincere thanks to Roche Diagnostics, the manufacturer of the testing machine, for prioritizing their order “over the requests of other, developed countries.”

The company also made a donation worth US$35,000 to MOHS and the Central Committee on Prevention, Control and Treatment of Coronavirus Disease on March 15.

Last week, Kanbawza (KBZ) Bank also donated nearly $1 million-worth of medical supplies and protective equipment for hospital staff.

Myanmar Govt to Provide Free Basic Food for Poor During COVID-19 Shutdown

The government’s COVID-19 response committee has promised to provide free food to those struggling with the coronavirus shut down during the 10-day Thingyan Water Festival holiday.

– By The Irrawaddy

YANGON — Myanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi-led national level COVID-19 response team announced on Monday afternoon that the government will provide basic food for those struggling across the country during the 10-day New Year holiday from this week amid heavier restrictions on movement to curb the coronavirus spread.

So far Myanmar has reported 22 positive cases with one fatality.

The announcement came after the State Counselor’s request for citizens to stay at home during the Thingyan Water Festival, the largest event in Myanmar’s calendar, to prevent the spread of the disease.

The April 10 to 19 holiday follows further restrictions on residents’ movements, including orders for people to stay at home, shutting down public transport and banning gatherings.

Thingyan normally allows many families to earn money by selling food and beverages to revelers.

In the announcement on Monday, the COVID-19 Prevent, Control, Treatment Committee said from Friday the government would distribute rice, cooking oil, salt, beans and onions to those who lack a regular income during the holiday.

Daw Aung San Suu Kyi previously posted on Facebook that she was aware of people’s concerns during the holiday and said the government was planning a solution.

Apart from food distribution, the government has promised to provide 150 free electricity units for domestic use until the end of April to encourage people to stay at home.

Myanmar’s Mandalay Promises Food Supplies for the Poor

Mandalay Region says it is preparing to deliver food to those struggling to eat during the COVID-19 restrictions.

Mandalay – The Mandalay regional government says it will spend 1 billion kyats (US$770,000) feeding struggling families in the region during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Mandalay Region has imposed travel restrictions and close major markets such as Zay Cho, Yadanarpon and Mingalar, leaving the city nearly deserted.

The acting chief minister, U Zarni Aung, said the regional government’s fund would provide rice, cooking oil, beans, pulses and other basic commodities for people who had lost earnings due to travel restrictions and the closure of the markets and businesses to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

“The regional government has instructed all administrative offices to collect a list of people who earn very little and are affected by the pandemic. We will support them with essential commodities such as rice and cooking oil,” said the acting chief minister.

Porters, taxi drivers and street hawkers working at the markets and bus stations have been made jobless.

The regional government also said it was accepting donations from the private sector to help those struggling with the shutdowns.

Township authorities have been told to list porters, motorcycle taxi drivers, street hawkers, flower sellers and other traders.

“Once we receive the list, we will distribute the commodities to those who are urgently in need, using safety measures to minimize contact. Civil societies organizations and volunteers are also invited to cooperate,” U Zarni Aung added.

The Mandalay government has donated rice, cooking oil, bean and pulses, onions and other essentials for over 48,000 Buddhist monks and nuns so they do not need to go out to collect offerings.

“Buddhist monks and nuns are vulnerable to coronavirus as they have to go out every day to collect alms. Since we are urging people to stay home, they need to stay in their monasteries,” U Zarni Aung said. “We are thinking of extending the support.”

Mandalay Region and in Monywa and Sagaing of Sagaing Region have voluntary groups helping struggling households with commodities, masks, soap, hand sanitizers and medicine.

Yangon has social volunteer teams, including celebrities, donating commodities to the poor.

Other regions and states have been slower to gear up a response to the crisis.

Man Killed in Sword Attack After COVID-19 Argument in Myanmar’s Bago Region

A man has been killed and two relatives injured in a sword attack on an administrator’s home after a heated argument over a COVID-19 suspect in a guesthouse.

– By Kaung Myat Min

Pyay, Bago Region — One man was killed and two others were injured in a brawl over a suspected COVID-19 case in Gyobingauk Township, Tharrawaddy District in western Bago Region on Sunday.

On Saturday, U Barbu Lay, a 100-household administrator — a community-appointed lower-ranking administrator responsible for around 100 homes in a ward — of Ywama North ward in Gyobingauk led community elders to inspect a guesthouse in the ward after he received reports that a guest was sick and coughing.

The administrator and the guesthouse owner argued. The following day, at around 7 pm, approximately 20 sword-wielding people raided the administrator’s house, a Gyobingauk police officer told The Irrawaddy.

According to the police, a 26-year-old man was killed in the incident. A 40-year-old man was seriously injured in his head and neck and remains in critical condition at Yangon General Hospital and a 58-year-old woman was also injured. All three are relatives of the administrator.

“There are three main suspects, including guesthouse owner U Maung Aye. They have run away and the police are after them. The guesthouse has been closed,” said the police officer.

A ward resident told The Irrawaddy on condition of anonymity: “Someone saw a sick guest coughing as he bought medicine at a betel nut shop beside the guesthouse and told the ward administrators. They did not ask the guesthouse owner to close, they just asked him to send the sick guest to a quarantine center. The owner was angry and accused the administrator of driving a wedge between him and his neighbors.”

U Mang Aye and U Barbu Lay had a heated argument in front of the latter’s house before men with swords came, he said.

“Then U Barbu Lay asked his family to flee. Then his nephews arrived and the men attacked them with swords. It is as if there is no rule of law at all,” he added.

U Barbu Lay has filed a complaint with the police against the guesthouse owner and his accomplices.

Myanmar Government Bans Staff From New Year Travel to Stop COVID-19 Spread

Myanmar’s roughly 1 million civil servants have been banned from traveling to their home towns for the New Year water festival to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

– By San Yamin Aung

YANGON — In a move to control the spread of COVID-19, Myanmar’s government has banned all civil servants from traveling during the Thingyan water festival.

The New Year public holiday normally sees government staff returning to their home towns or planning family trips of five to 10 days.

According to the Union Civil Service Board, Myanmar has around 1 million civil servants.

The President’s Office said in a directive issued on Saturday no civil servants would be allowed to travel, except for funerals, from April 10 to 19.

It said the ban would prevent civil servants from transmitting coronavirus to colleagues when they return to work and risk disrupting the operations of government.

The President’s Office said alternative holidays would be arranged when the COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.

Following the directive, many express bus lines in Naypyitaw suspended all timetables.

In Naypyitaw, around 100 bus lines are running to 51 cities.

The government has banned large gatherings until the end of April, including Thingyan.

State and regional governments have ordered residents to stay at home from April 10 to 19, except for medical treatment and to buy food.

State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday said the next two to three weeks would be critical as it became apparent how fast COVID-19 was spreading, calling for the public to follow government instructions.

“We’ll have to experience a kind of Thingyan that we’ve never experienced before: a Thingyan where we have to totally avoid crowds. Some will question how many people make a ‘crowd’. I would say the fewer the better and the farther apart the better,” she wrote.

She encouraged citizens not to be disheartened by the lack of water throwing, loud music and merriment.

“They say that, ‘health is the greatest of blessings’. We can all make this great donation with goodwill whereby we can all give the greatest of health blessings not only to ourselves but to others as well… In this very special Thingyan, we can perform very good deeds. We can do this at home, without moving.”

Myanmar confirmed 21 COVID-19 cases by Sunday night. One 69-year-old patient, who had been undergoing treatment for stage-four cancer and tested positive for COVID-19, died on Tuesday.

Myanmar Govt Cracks Down on Fake COVID-19 News

The Myanmar government is following through on its threats to punish anyone who spreads fake news about COVID-19 as authorities arrested a man on Saturday for a Facebook post.

– By Zarni Mann

MANDALAY—The Myanmar government has begun to take legal action against people who spread “fake news” and rumors related to the coronavirus as authorities arrested and charged a man from Bago Region’s Yaytarshay Township on Saturday.

According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Bone Myint Moe was arrested for posting a message saying “Ba Ring Gone is positive” in the Facebook group for Yaytarshay on Saturday evening.

“He wrote that there was a COVID-19 positive patient in Ba Ring Gone Village who was sent to Taungoo and warned people to be careful,” said a police officer from Yaytarshay police station. “An official from the township administration office filed a lawsuit under the Natural Disaster Management Law’s Article 27.”

The article says that anyone who spreads misinformation about a disaster with the aim of sparking dread among the public shall be punished with a maximum of one year in prison and a fine.

Since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the Myanmar government has told people in the country not to spread the rumors and to beware of fake news.

As soon as the country’s first COVID-19 case was reported, the government issued repeated warnings that anyone who spreads rumors or fake news will be punished according to the law.

The government also warned that those who refuse to follow rules and regulations imposed to combat the coronavirus could face lawsuits under the 2013 Natural Disaster Management Law

A groom who held a wedding celebration in Tamu, Sagaing Division, in violation of local authorities’ instructions to postpone the event was sentenced to six months in prison and ordered to pay a one million kyat fine (US$700) on Friday, under the Natural Disaster Management Law.

The groom, Htan Lin Shein, arrived from the United States and did not home quarantine for 14 days, instead choosing to hold his wedding reception on March 28, despite authorities’ instructions that he must postpone the event to avoid drawing a crowd. Another groom from the same township is facing the same lawsuit under the same law for also holding his wedding.

In Sagaing Division’s Khin Oo Township, a man is facing a lawsuit under the same law for holding a Buddhist ritual ceremony to celebrate the ordination of local young monks.

A man in Sagaing’s Ye Oo Township was arrested for running away from a government COVID-19 quarantine facility and is also facing a lawsuit under the Natural Disaster Management Law.

Two men from Sagaing’s Ayadaw Township and Mandalay’s Tada-U Township were arrested and sued for attacking local authorities who were conducting patrols and education programs on coronavirus prevention.

Myanmar’s KBZ Bank Donates Nearly $1M to Coronavirus Efforts

Kanbawza Bank has donated nearly US$1 million worth of medical supplies to Myanmar’s health ministry to support efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19.

Myanmar’s largest private bank, Kanbawza (KBZ) Bank, airlifted in hospital supplies from China as part of a 1.4 billion-kyat (nearly US$1 million) donation to Myanmar’s health ministry for use in combatting COVID-19.

Some conglomerates in Myanmar are supporting the government in the fight against the coronavirus by donating medical supplies such as masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as money.

KBZ Bank transported some supplies across the China-Myanmar border in the last week of March, but to fulfill the urgent need in Myanmar, the bank also chartered a Myanmar Airways International plane to airlift supplies from Guangzhou, China.

The bank also donated 600,000 surgical masks and 3,000 sets of PPE that it imported from China through the Muse border checkpoint in Shan State between March 27 and Friday.

Myanmar so far has 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Sunday, including one patient with nasal cancer who died last week.

MOHS spokesman Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw told The Irrawaddy that the government is doing its best to prepare hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients, in case Myanmar has more confirmed cases in the near future.

“Whether these donated supplies will be enough for treatment is hard to tell, as we don’t know yet how many more patients we will have,” he said on Monday.

Myanmar’s State Counselor Vows ‘Zero Tolerance’ for Price Gougers of COVID-19 Protective Items

Those who jack up prices of essential items needed in the fight against COVID-19 will face prosecution, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has warned.

– By The Irrawaddy

YANGON—Myanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has issued a stern warning to anyone who would engage in price gouging on surgical masks amid a steady rise in COVID-19 cases in the country, saying she had a “zero tolerance” policy toward those who jack up prices of essential goods.

As of Sunday, 21 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in Myanmar, with one fatality related to the disease

Even before the first positive case was detected in the country in late March, prices for ordinary surgical masks were beginning to skyrocket, partly due to hoarding by retailers.

Amid panic buying and shortages at pharmacies, the face coverings, which cost just 50 kyats (about 3.5 US cents) in normal times, are now fetching 10 times that amount.

At the same time, in some hospitals doctors and nurses are publicly complaining that they have been working without proper Personal Protective Equipment like facial coverings. Though the advisability of wearing masks is still being debated globally, growing numbers of people in Myanmar can be seen wearing them when venturing outdoors.

On Sunday, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi assured Myanmar people through her Facebook page that Myanmar’s Ministry of Health and Sports had 6.3 million masks to be distributed this month, and that many more are in the pipeline.

However, the mask issue was raised with Myanmar’s de facto leader during her live videoconference on Monday with officials who are on the frontline in the fight against the disease in Bago Region, where three COVID-19 cases, including two children, were detected last week.

When Dr. Aye Nyein, a regional medical official, complained about shortages and price gouging on masks, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi sternly said that raising the price when people were suffering was totally unethical.

“It’s unlawful. We have a law against [gouging and hoarding]. If there is a complaint, we will take action,” she said.

“They are playing with people’s lives for their personal interests. I have zero tolerance for it,” she added.

On March 30, Myanmar’s Ministry of Commerce imposed a ban on price gouging on food, medicines and equipment related to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, as well as on hoarding such items, which have been declared “essential goods”.

Violators face imprisonment for six months to three years under the Special Supplies and Services Law, the ministry said.

So far, there have been no reports of anyone being prosecuted under the law.

Going green: two weeks after Bogotá’s quarantine, live traffic maps show zero rush hour.

Key points on coronavirus in Colombia:

35 deaths and 1,485 cases across 26 departments

Face masks now obligatory on public transport

Talk (but no promises) of ‘smart quarantine’ after current lockdown ends

COVID-19 cases reported to April 5 by Instituo Nacinional de Salud www.ins.gov.co

We are now one month since the first case (March 6) and latest stats show:

88 COVID-19 patients recovered (average age 42 years)

1,167 patients are sick but still at home (average age 40 years)

35 persons confirmed to have the virus have have died (average age 60)

Graphs showing COVID-19 cases in Colombia to April 5. Source: INS

Hospitalised cases are 195, which represents about 14% of currently affected patients. Of these 63 people (4.5%) are in the ‘UCI’ intensive care units, these are high-risk or severely affected patients.

Read all our coverage of COVID-19 in Colombia

This proportion of COVID-19 hospitalisation in Colombia reflects WHO global clinical findings from other countries that “most patients with COVID-19 develop only mild illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalisation and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit.”

Capital increase

Coronavirus has spread to 26 departments, including Isla San Andrés, but the capital Bogotá remains the major hot-spot and accounts for almost half of all confirmed cases: That’s to say the city has close to the same number as the rest of Colombia combined, with new infections rising faster.

Bogotá vs. The Rest of Colombia in terms of coronavirus cases. Data source INS

There could be several factors to this: The larger and denser population, its role as a transport hub and the cooler weather (which can facilitate transmissions, according to recent scientific reports). There is also likely to be a testing bias towards Bogotá, with more labs based here (INS, District Health).

Time to tapaboca

As we covered in the last update, there’s been a global change of tack over face masks, and from today in Colombia people using public transport systems – buses, taxis, TransMilenios etc, – will have to use tapabocas or face a stiff fine.

According to new presidential decrees, the face masks will be mandatory in “areas where there is a massive influx of people such as market places, supermarkets, banks, pharmacies, where it is not possible to maintain a minimum distance of 1 metre.” Don’t say we didn’t warn you.

Remember you can make your own cloth face covering if there are none to buy.

Testing times

How is COVID-19 testing in Colombia? In several updates we’ve talked about the importance of testing, and the problems faced in Colombia with faulty machinery, tests samples not surviving transfer to Bogotá for analysis, or patients never getting their test results back.

The latest news is that health authorities are rolling out COVID-19 testing to 60 labs with more decentralised sites. Health authorities recently announced collaboration with South Korea. Details are scarce, but according to some media reports “a plane will be sent” to Seoul to collect a large quantity of test materials as part of a plan to increase testing capacity to 17,000 a day.

Bogotá Quarantine: life in Usaquén

In the month since the first confirmed coronavirus case in Colombia, the INS reports having done 23,000 tests, an average rate of 760 per day, though in the last week this has increased to 1,700 per day, with some lab teams working in shifts to process samples 24 hours.

Look east to ease the lockdown?

In the previous update we looked at what happens next after the current national three-week quarantine ends on April 13.

Colombia’s health minister has already given some hints: the “accordion strategy” of squeezing and releasing movement restrictions according to how the outbreak is going, i.e. follow the science.

Today President Duque talked about “smart isolation” similar to used in Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore which rely on mass testing, rapid contact tracing, and selected isolation of contacts of positive cases. If successfully adopted in Colombia – perhaps a big “if” – this could mean easing of the blanket quarantine we have at present.

Duque suggested that the vulnerable and elderly will continue to be kept inside and that schools and colleges will stay shut.

The technical failure was a disaster for the National Health Institute (INS), whose machine was able to do 100 tests per hour broke down on Friday.

While technicians were repairing the machine, INS workers were forced to test the incoming samples manually, causing a major delay.

The INS reported on Saturday that the machine had been repaired allowing the institute that has been at the forefront of confronting the crisis to catch up.

Universities throughout Colombia have been setting up testing equipment to support the INS before test requests saturate the health institute’s machine, which allegedly has the capacity to do 1,600 tests a day.

The technical failure happened in the early stages of the spread of the disease, allowing the INS and universities to catch up quickly.

With little more than 700 cases and 10 deaths confirmed on Sunday, the real capacity of the INS and its university partners has yet to be put to the test.

The health institute expects one third of Colombia’s 50 million inhabitants at some point to be infected.

The country is currently in quarantine to slow down the spreading of the disease while the government makes emergency funds available to rapidly ramp up the country’s healthcare system.

Meanwhile, citizen initiatives seek to complement government action; demobilized FARC rebels have begun producing masks, for example, while Medellin engineers have begun developing low-cost mechanical ventilators in an attempt to dramatically increase intensive care units’ capacities throughout the country.

The biggest fear is not so much the virus, but the stability of the country’s healthcare system, which was already on the brink of collapse, largely due to corruption.

So far, the hospitals are able to handle the coronavirus as only 66 of the 686 infected people have been hospitalized and 33 are in intensive care.

This is a fraction compared to European countries where the virus arrived much earlier. Spain, which has a similar number of inhabitants as Colombia, saw the number of infections increase by almost 6,900 cases on Sunday alone.","['1,600 tests', '100 tests']",,,

Colombian COVID-19 cases had risen to 798 by March 30.

Key events since our last update:

190 new coronavirus cases in previous two days

798 cases reported since March 6

14 deaths so far, including two younger victims

INS predicts 3,000 COVID-19 deaths in Colombia

Colombia’s COVID-19 cases are slowly rising but yet to see the rocketing growth experienced by other worse stricken countries. Is this good news? Or a calm before the storm? And how far can we trust the testing?

Latest figures show 798 confirmed cases and 14 deaths, with continued steady rises in the big cities – particularly Bogotá and Cali. The two most recent fatalities are a 63-year-old woman in Neiva and a 68-year-old man in Cali.

Data comes from Instituto Nacional de Salud, an oversight body charged with – among other things – compiling stats on transmissible diseases and testing for the COVID-19.

Read all our coronavirus in coverage here.

INS director Martha Lucía Ospina told El Tiempo this week that the respiratory disease was unstoppable and that “no health system in the world” could absorb the peak caseload of the disease. Even with containment, she said the virus could cause 3,000 deaths in Colombia.

“Every effort is made by the government to make a more effective health response, but we are talking about a minimum of around 3,000 dead,” she told El Tiempo. “We are not playing at creating fear, but understanding the epidemic’s capacity to kill. We don’t want that to happen, but mathematically it is a probability.”

Coronavirus curve to March 30. Data source: INS

According to Dr Ospina, 80% of the people infected in Colombia with COVID-19 would get only light symptoms.

Testing was improving with air patrols now able to collect samples from remoter parts of the country, she said. Test reagents had arrived in Colombia, but there was still a shortage of specialised equipment and trained staff. Despite the constraints, the INS expects to oversee 300,000 tests in the next two months.

Survival of the healthiest

In the last update, we suggested that Colombia’s young population (average age 30 years, with only 7.5% over 70 years old) could better resist the virus. Worldwide data for fatality rates and age ranges show that so far in the outbreak, people aged over 80 with the disease have a much higher probability of dying (15%) than younger folk (from 8% to 0.2%).

To date, the average age of Colombia’s 12 coronavirus deaths is 63 years with two people under 40. More surprising is that the average age of people currently hospitalised in intensive care in Colombia is 55 years, with several under 40 years old. This confirms the fact that coronavirus does not just kill los viejos.

How you can help vulnerable Bogotanos during the quarantine

What are the possible factors in severe cases in younger people? According to the U.S.’s Centre for Disease Control (CDC), coronavirus is complicated by:

chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma

heart disease with complications

compromised immune systems (including those on cancer treatment)

severe obesity (body mass index ≥40)

diabetes, kidney problems, liver disease.

For example, one of Colombia’s younger deaths in Cali was a “36-year-old man with obesity and a smoker,” according to city authorities.

Perfect pandemic storm

According to a recent New York Times article, a country’s poor general health can create a “perfect pandemic storm”. In the U.S. cardiovascular disease in some form affects half the adult population, 36% are obese, and 10% have diabetes.

By some measures, Colombia is slightly healthier with adult obesity at 22%, diabetes in adults at 7%, and 25% with high blood pressure. But it’s far from perfect and worse than Asian countries that for dietary reasons often have less of these chronic diseases.

One contradiction of the current quarantine in Colombia is stopping people from getting out to exercise – a key factor in reducing chronic conditions such as high blood pressure. If quarantine continues, the country needs a plan to let people keep fit while maintaining social distance.

Exercise combats many chronic diseases. Will it be worked into the quarantine plan?

How long will the COVID-19 quarantine last?

And talking of quarantine, the question on everyone’s mind is: for how much more will be locked down? Bogota’s lockdown started on March 20 and continues with the national initiative until April 13. But then what?

While most people support the isolation measures, halfway into lockdown there is a lack of certainty creating mental limbo on top of the economic hardships at both street and macro level. Could we last the biblical cuarenta (40) days?

This week Bogotá’s mayor Claudia López said that the capital’s citizens were complying with the quarantine “75%” and should “get it in their heads that the quarantine could last more than three months“.

In a slightly softer message, Colombia’s President Duque told TV viewers on Sunday that the state will keep some current measures and “design others” for after April 13, and that “the post-isolation plan will revolve around the preservation of the greatest number of lives.”

Coronavirus: what were they thinking?

What happens next depends on what the COVID-19 infection data shows these coming weeks. What we do know is that so far Colombia’s COVID-19 response has followed the advice of international experts leading the response, such as the WHO, and has been an early adopter of enforced isolation.

Duque’s team will also be watching closely how the outbreak evolves in other worse-hit countries.

Braking the coronavirus outbreak

From that we know that strict quarantine is showing signs of slowing the deadly outbreak in Italy, for example. And strict social distancing could be behind an early drop in the growth of coronavirus cases in Ireland, where cases are still low in numbers.

But some bad news from Hong Kong is that early easing of lockdowns there quickly led to an upsurge in cases, leading to a rapid return to clamp-down.

Hong Kong and China are now trying a series of short sharp quarantines interspersed with easing of restrictions and localised lockdowns in zones where cases have surged.

This means quick mass testing and fast reactions by health authorities, the goal being to ease restrictions while continuing to slow the virus spread so as not to overload health systems – thus saving lives – meanwhile encouraging herd immunity and buying time until a vaccine or cure comes along.

Given the economic problems caused by long-term lockdowns, the Hong Kong model could be the way forward and maybe what Colombia’s experts already have in mind.

COVID-19 antibodies are best

Some good news is that the COVID-19 is slow to mutate. This makes an eventual vaccine more effective, but also suggests people previously infected can recover and return to normal life with their natural antibodies – which people form while fighting the virus – to protect them from further disease.

This requires the newer “antibody tests”, now being rolled out, which tell doctors if someone has been infected in the past, even if they were not aware.

City at a standstill. Can antibody testing for COVID-19 get things moving again?

In fact, some countries like Germany are already proposing mass testing and “antibody certificates” whereby people can return to work if proven to be naturally immune.

Antibody testing could also answer the burning question: Exactly how many of us caught the COVID-19 in Colombia but never knew? These tests will hopefully get to Colombia and show us the way forward.

Testing glitches could give misleading case numbers.

Latest data shows the rate of contagion is increasing in Colombia, despite faults in COVID-19 testing continuing to cast doubts over the true picture of coronavirus in the country.

Coronavirus: What were they thinking?

In the last update (March 26) we highlighted problems with quality of patient samples and geographic scope of tests. Then Colombia’s main health lab at the Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) suffered key equipment failure, creating a backlog of unprocessed sample.

The machinery is now fixed but the glitch seems to have created a dip in positive cases last Friday – only 10 confirmed for COVID-19 according to INS data.

Coronavirus curve for Colombia. A slight flattening on Friday was caused by a faulty machine in the main testing lab. Data source: INS

Bogotá, Colombia’s capital, continues as the main hot-spot with 264 cases to date, 43% of the total in country’s total – a percentage that has stayed fairly steady for a week now – and 50% of the deaths.

Globetrotting virus carriers

Roughly 80% of the Bogotá cases are directly connected to people who flew in from other countries, the majority from Spain and Italy showing the city’s vulnerability as a hub for international spread of the virus.

We could tentatively conclude that this travel factor explains the concentration of cases in the city’s wealthier barrios – Usaquén (38 cases), Chapinero (30), Suba (27) where globetrotters and their families are more likely to reside.

Read all our coronavirus coverage here

According to official data, poor barrios down south have hardly been affected so far. Highly populated Ciudad Bolívar and Usmé have only recorded one case each.

This is likely to change in coming weeks as the virus spreads by local community transmission, and air travel bans reduce imported cases.

We can welcome the fact there were no new deaths reported in the last two days, leaving the total at six cases.

Speed test

There is also small comfort that Colombia is not alone in its COVID-19 testing problems: Many countries including US, Italy and the UK have messed up this vital part of the response leaving health experts with a insufficient data to shape their response.

This partly explains the wildly varying death rates from the virus across then world, from 0.5% (Germany) to a horrifying 10% (Italy) since if we have limited lab testing we never know how many people were actually infected. Or how many really died of the disease.

New coranavirus detection devices and ‘rapid tests’ are being rushed out around the world, including a five-minute portable kit announced today.

Young and coronavirus-death free?

Will Colombia’s relatively young population mean less coronavirus deaths? Let’s hope so. Worldwide stats show a sharp increased in COVID-19 fatality rate over 70 years of age. See the table below from Worldometer.

AGE DEATH RATE WORLDWIDE

(probability of dying if infected by the virus) 80+ years old 14.80% 70-79 years old 8.00% 60-69 years old 3.60% 50-59 years old 1.30% 40-49 years old 0.40% 30-39 years old 0.20% 20-29 years old 0.20% 10-19 years old 0.20% 0-9 years old 0

Colombia’s relatively young average age of 30 years could means less fatalities since younger people get a less severe illness.

In Colombia only 7.5% of the population is over 70 years old. Compare this to Italy, with an average age of 47 and 20% of the population is over 70, where you would expect at least twice as many deaths.

The scramble to make beds

Another key factor in reducing coronavirus deaths is a health system’s capacity to save lives, and the last days we have seen the US, and European countries, scrambling to set up emergency intensive care wards and source equipment such as ventilators which keep severe patients alive.

One shocking fact revealed by El Tiempo today was Colombia’s lack of ‘UCI’ (intensive care) beds, currently there are 5,000 across the country though five large departments (Vaupés, Vichada, Guainía, Amazonas y Guaviare) are without a single one. It has long been a tradition to transfer patients from these places in air-ambulances to Bogotá or Villavicencio.

Five remote departments currently transfer severely ill patients to distant cities, and lack an intensive are beds in their hospitals. This will affect coronavirus cases.

Added to that, 80% of the current ICU beds in Colombia are already full with other patients. How will we cope?

According to projections reported by El Tiempo, even under the best case scenario, by May the country will need 16,000 ICU beds to cope with severe cases.

Coronavirus leaves tourists stranded in Colombia.

So like many other countries, Colombia is in a race against time to ready its health system and, as mentioned in previous updates, is creating pop-up hospitals in warehouses and conference centres.

But will it be enough? And will they have the hi-tech equipment to keep people alive? We’ll bring you updates in the coming days.",,,"['16,000 ICU beds']",
Colombia,04-06-2020 12:00,https://colombiareports.com/colombias-weak-spots-that-could-undo-initial-coronavirus-contingency-success/,The threats that could undo Colombia’s initial coronavirus contingency success,"Colombia’s authorities so far have been able to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, but this reported success could be deceiving as the national strategy is still facing major challenges.

So far, the relatively quick and determined response of both local and national government has prevented a sudden increase in confirmed infections and a relatively low mortality rate.

But there are still gaping holes in the system that require urgent fixing.

The health intermediaries

The biggest threat to a successful contingency strategy and the country’s healthcare system in general are the country’s health intermediaries, called EPS’s.

These private enterprises prioritize which client receives medical support and where. Over the past two decades, however, the EPS’s have become notorious for their rampant corruption and mismanagement.

According to newspaper El Espectador, of the 45 companies that mediate between Colombians and healthcare providers registered in January last year, only 19 operate without any kind of sanction.

Five so-called EPS’s were liquidated, another three were banned from operating in parts of the country and another 18 are under special surveillance, the newspaper reported.

Every Colombian must compulsory pay these EPS’s. Nevertheless, these companies have more often than not pocketed profits instead of paying hospitals, leaving them on the brink of bankruptcy and medical staff unpaid.

President Ivan Duque promised a $1.5 billion injection into the country’s health sector in an attempt to cancel at least some of the EPS’s debts to the hospitals. According to the Colombian Hospital Association, however, the EPS owe the hospitals as much as $7.7 billion.

Also now the International Health Institute (INS), The Colombian Medical Federation (FMC) and the Comptroller General’s Office accuse the private companies of not adequately carrying out coronavirus tests on patients.

Furthermore, one FMC executive accused some EPS’s of planning to grant ICU units to the highest bidder, effectively excluding most of their paying clients from life-saving healthcare while forcing a bidding war among those who can afford excessive health payments.

Lack of testing

Partially because of the EPS’s negligence, Colombia is the world’s worst performer when it comes to performing coronavirus tests per million inhabitants, according to Health Policy Watch (HPW).

These tests are elementary for the early detection of infections, and allow the isolation of infected people and the prevention of the uncontrolled spread of the virus.

The lack of testing allows infected people who do not (yet) notice any symptoms to infect others uncontrollably.

Similarly, it reduces the reliability of statistics gathered and increases the possibility that the real number of infections is much higher than the confirmed ones.

According to the HPW, Colombia’s health facilities are currently carrying out only 209 tests per million inhabitants compared to 2032 in the US, 7566 in South Korea and 68286 in Iceland.

Colombia’s universities are working closely with the INS to dramatically increase the country’s testing capacity.

Medical supply shortages

Like many other countries, Colombia’s government has had trouble providing medical personnel with the adequate protective gear that allows them to treat patients without putting themselves in danger.

This could take out much of the country’s medical personnel if they are infected while on the frontline of helping infected patients and leave hospitals without doctors and nurses.

Many physicians have been forced to make their own bio-safety suits, masks and gloves that are increasingly difficult to import.

‘The decision of US President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to attend an unprecedented health crisis in his own country, for example, banned the export of so-called N-95 masks for medical personnel that had been ordered by Colombia.

The military, volunteers and even former FARC guerrillas have begun producing masks and uniforms to provide the doctors and nurses with the protection they need to treat patients without falling ill themselves.

Medical engineers have additionally embarked on the production of low-cost and open source ventilators that could help safe lives when the number of patients needing ventilators exceed the 8,000 ventilators available in the country.

The state’s solvency

Colombia’s state finances were already in trouble before the coronavirus broke out because of an oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia that sank the price of oil, Colombia’s largest export product.

The dropping oil prices and the devaluation of the peso pretty much destroyed Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla’s budget.

The government made unprecedented investments in healthcare, food provision for the poor while the country is in quarantine, the freezing of tax collection and making sure the country’s financial system doesn’t collapse.

The central bank stepped in announcing unprecedented measures, but still their capacity has their limits and there comes a point the state simply goes bankrupt.

The World Bank announced it would extend a $250 million loan, but this is not even enough to compensate the expected $1.2 billion the Health Ministry said the country’s healthcare system would need to deal with the pandemic, let alone the other emergency measures.

To make sure Colombia doesn’t go broke many billions are needed. With the entire global economy at risk, chances are slim this money will become available any time soon.

The entire world is going to need a solution to the unprecedented damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but governments must first attend their domestic crises before coming up with a global solution.",['209 tests'],"['8,000 ventilators']",,

The hospital’s staff parking lot is now home to eight generator-supplied tents, each with 11 beds, meant to house coronavirus patients without respiratory complications in an effort to avoid crowding the existing intensive care unit.

The Andean country will enter a nationwide 19-day quarantine this week aimed at preventing further spread of the virus, which has killed more than 15,300 people worldwide. Colombia has 277 confirmed infections and three deaths attributable to the virus.

“We’ve been preparing for several months, since we started to see what was happening in other countries in relation to COVID-19,” hospital director General Clara Esperanza Galvis told Reuters.

The hospital, set close to the steep hills that descend to Bogota’s eastern fringes, is used to very different kinds of patients.

During the height of the country’s armed conflict between the government, leftist rebels, right-wing paramilitary groups and drug cartels many patients were security force personnel injured by bombs, bullets and landmines. The conflict has killed 260,000 people.

A 2016 peace deal with largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), greatly reduced the number of military personnel receiving treatment for fresh wounds.

The hospital is also known for its work on mental health and tropical diseases.

Without the tents the hospital has 450 beds and an intensive care unit with capacity for 50 patients.

The country’s main police hospital, also in Bogota, has installed similar tents with 174 beds.

The health ministry predicts that up to 4 million people, about 8% of the population, could contract coronavirus in Colombia.

The country’s already overstretched health system has 84,500 hospital beds, well below international standards that urge between 2.5 and 4 beds per 1,000 inhabitants.

Intensive care units in the country have just 5,600 beds and insufficient respirators.

Asked if contingency plans will be enough to respond to the virus, Galvis said she “would like to hope so.”

“Given the experience of other countries we know it will be difficult, but we are preparing,” she said.

As with worst-hit Italy, Spain has seen the rate of new infections and deaths slow in recent days, giving cause for hope that the peak has passed.

Today, its health ministry reported a fourth consecutive daily drop in the number of coronavirus-related deaths.

There were 637 fatalities recorded over the past 24 hours, a 5% daily increase on the total to 13,055, but down from 12% a week ago and the lowest total in 13 days.

The number of new infections also slowed, rising 3.3% to 135,032, down from a rise of 4.8% the day before.

""We are preparing ourselves for de-escalation for which it is important to know who is contaminated to be able to gradually lift Spanish citizens' lockdown,"" Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez told TV station Antena 3.

While so far only those infected or suspected of having Covid-19 have been tested, now checks will focus on the wider population to try to find carriers who may not be displaying symptoms, Ms Gonzalez said.

Spanish companies are manufacturing 240,000 test kits per week and are boosting capacity, the minister said, while equipment is also being bought from abroad.

Spain has been in lockdown since 14 March and Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said at the weekend that that would remain in place until 26 April.

However, Mr Sanchez opened the door to easing some restrictions, such as keeping all non-essential workers at home, after Easter, even though shops and restaurants will stay shut.

Checkpoints were lifted today in four hard-hit towns in the northeastern Catalonia region, where there have been more than 100 deaths, the health ministry said.

Meanwhile, Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz said that his country could start easing its coronavirus lockdown measures from next week, but warned that this depended on citizens abiding by social distancing rules.

""The aim is that from 14 April ... smaller shops up to a size of 400 square metres, as well as hardware and garden stores can open again, under strict security conditions of course,"" Mr Kurz said at a press conference.

'Unequivocally evident that social distancing can help control the trajectory of the pandemic'

SEATTLE, April 7, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- New COVID-19 estimates find that, among European nations, the peak daily death rate from the pandemic will occur during the third week of April, with the pandemic spreading from Southern Europe.

The new forecasts, released today by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington's School of Medicine, find that approximately 151,680 people will die during what researchers are calling the ""first wave"" of the pandemic. By comparison, the US is expected to face 81,766 deaths, according to forecasts released on Sunday by IHME.

""We are expecting a foreboding few weeks for people in many parts of Europe,"" said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray. ""It seems likely the number of deaths will exceed our projections for the United States.""

This is despite the declines in deaths that are now occurring in Italy and Spain.

The death toll in many countries is compounded by demand for hospital resources well in excess of what is available. For example, peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds needed compared to 17,765 available, 24,544 ICU beds compared to 799 ICU beds available, and 20,862 ventilators needed (with data currently unavailable on ventilators available).

Today's announcement on Europe finds that most regions of Italy and Spain have passed their peaks in the number of deaths, while other nations are approaching their peaks and still others facing peak mortality later in April.

Countries that are about to peak or are quickly approaching peak in this wave of the epidemic include The Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, and Luxembourg. The Czech Republic and Romania are midway through their expected trajectories. Other nations including the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, and Greece are still early in their trajectories and face fast-rising death tolls through their peaks in the second and third weeks of April.

""It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,"" Murray said. ""Those nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation's trajectory will change – and dramatically for the worse – if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.""

Murray cautioned that easing these precautions too soon during the first wave of the pandemic could lead to new rounds of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. He defines the end of this ""wave"" as a ratio of 0.3 deaths per 1 million people. IHME's projections assume that social distancing measures, if not currently implemented, will be implemented within one week.

""To decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass produced, and distributed widely,"" Murray said.

IHME started making projections of the pandemic's impact in the United States state-by-state on March 26. Today's announcement is the first set of predictions for European nations and is based on modeling the peak in death rates and hospital usage in Wuhan City in China, where the virus was first discovered, as well as data from seven European locations that have peaked, including Madrid, Spain; Castile-La Mancha, Spain; Tuscany, Italy; Emilia-Romagna, Italy; Liguria, Italy; Piedmont, Italy; and Lombardy, Italy.

Of these eight locations that have reached the peak regarding daily deaths, only one, Wuhan, has currently brought new cases to nearly zero.

The analysis is based on an extensive range of information and data sources, including:

Local governments, national governments, and the World Health Organization

Government declarations on implementation of social distancing policies

Age-specific death rate data from China , Italy , South Korea , and the US

Here are some country-specific findings from IHME's latest forecasting:

Spain’s worst single-day death toll yet brought the country’s total fatalities above 1,000.

Spain has swiftly followed Italy to become the second European country where hundreds of people are being killed by the coronavirus daily. The death toll shows little sign of slowing.

Some 5,500 hospital beds, including intensive care units, will be set up inside the 240,000 square metre IFEMA conference centre on the capital’s outskirts to cope with surging demand expected in the coming days, the Madrid region said in a tweet.

“The most difficult days are coming now,” health emergencies chief Fernando Simon told a news conference.

The capital has become the epicentre of the disease in Spain. With nearly 20,000 cases reported as of Friday, Spain overtook Iran to become the world’s third hardest-hit country by the pandemic after China and Italy. The Madrid region accounts for 628 deaths and 7,165 cases.

Health Minister Salvador Illa said Spanish hospitals were running several clinical trials to treat severe and mild cases of the coronavirus, while the science ministry said researchers were working on potential vaccines and detection tests.

The government promised measures on Thursday to protect the elderly and staff at nursing homes after large numbers of deaths.

Some 30 firefighters were involved in an extensive disinfection operation at a Madrid nursing home, and a military team was working in another.

On Friday the government said providing more face masks would be a priority and it could also do more to help the most vulnerable groups. The justice ministry said 1,000 forensic doctors and technicians would be redeployed to tackle the epidemic.

The country has ramped up efforts to curb the spread of the disease in the past week, ordering a nationwide 15-day state of emergency on Saturday that bars people from all but essential outings. Bars, restaurants and most shops have been shut and transport restricted.

Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said police would start checking this weekend that no one was breaking these restrictions. He said more than 30,000 people had been fined and 300 arrested since they were announced.

“The confinement measures taken in Spain are the most drastic taken in Europe ... and one of the most drastic worldwide,” he said at a press briefing.

The lockdown is also having a ruinous impact on the economy, which already had one of the developed world’s highest unemployment rates.

Inditex, owner of clothing chain Zara, said it was considering temporarily laying off around 25,000 staff in Spain if the state of emergency continues beyond April 15.

Department store El Corte Ingles has moved more staff into its supermarket division as demand for click-and-collect service has increased by a factor of five, a spokeswoman told Reuters.

Banco Santander has closed nearly half its branches in Spain because fewer customers are visiting them as coronavirus spreads, a source said.

Cepyme, a lobby group representing small and medium-sized companies, said that assuming that the current lockdown lasts four weeks, it expected Spain to end the year with 300,000 fewer jobs than at the end of 2019.

On Thursday, the government gave all hotels seven days to shut.

Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said the restrictive measures taken by European Union countries would lead to a “very severe” economic disruption, calling for coordination at the EU level.",,,"['5,500 hospital beds']",
Ukraine,04-04-2020 22:55,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-rages-at-critics-at-coronavirus-press-conference,Trump Veers Off to Attack Ukraine Whistleblower at Coronavirus Briefing,"President Donald Trump on Saturday spent much of his daily press briefing on the coronavirus raging against perceived enemies, from the media, to the Ukraine whistleblower, to the recently ousted commander of a Navy aircraft carrier.

On the same day the U.S. death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic surpassed 8,000, Trump opened the briefing with a slam at the media, which he accused of “spreading false rumors.”

“Get this over with, then go back to your fake news,” Trump said.

While acknowledging that the nation will likely see “a lot of death” in the coming weeks, the president repeatedly reiterated his calls for the country to “get back to work” and ease up on protective restrictions.

And then he let loose on critics.

Asked about his Friday night firing of intelligence community inspector general Michael Atkinson, who notified Congress of the whistleblower complaint that ultimately led to his impeachment, Trump slammed both Atkinson and the whistleblower.

“Frankly, somebody oughta sue his ass off,” the president said of the anonymous intelligence whistleblower, adding that Atkinson, a Trump appointee, “did a terrible job.”

Trump also slammed Captain Brett Crozier, who was relieved of his duty commanding the USS Theodore Roosevelt after writing a letter warning about the spread of the coronavirus on his ship. While Crozier’s warnings were dismissed and his pleas for help to Navy leadership were met with punishment, more men on his ship wound up testing positive for the virus, with 137 cases as of Saturday.

In addition to backing the Navy’s decision to ax Crozier, Trump appeared to mock him for daring to sound the alarm about the virus.

“I thought it looked terrible what he did, to write a letter,” Trump said. “This is not a class on literature.”

He went on to take aim at the governors of states that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, claiming without evidence that the states were asking for more equipment than they needed. Trump singled out New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, claiming that the estimates that New York will need 40,000 ventilators were overestimates.

“40,000, think of it,” Trump said. “40,000. It’s not possible. They won’t need that many.”

While Trump won praise from some of his critics earlier this week for appearing to finally grasp the severity of the pandemic, on Saturday he once again seemed to buck expert advice by suggesting certain protective restrictions could soon be loosened.

Speaking about Easter Sunday—the “beautiful” date by which he had earlier suggested things could go back to normal—he mused about churches possibly holding special services with social distancing in mind.

“Maybe we could allow special, for churches, maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them, with great separation outside, on Easter Sunday. I don’t know, it's something we should talk about,” he said.

“We have to get this country open. This country was not designed to be closed...we're paying people to stay home...and they want to go to work.”

Trump also promoted hydroxychloroquine, the drug that’s become key to the Trump administration’s coronavirus response even though the FDA hasn’t approved its use against the virus.

“I may take it,” Trump said. “I have to ask my doctors about that.”

On Friday, President Trump announced a new CDC recommendation that Americans wear cloth or fabric face masks in public to help prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus, but bizarrely said that he wouldn’t bother to wear one himself.",,"['40,000 ventilators']",,
Ukraine,03-30-2020 00:00,https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/ukraine-dusts-off-soviet-era-ventilator-designs-to-help-fight-coronavirus/,Ukraine dusts off Soviet-era ventilator designs to help fight coronavirus,"KIEV – Ukraine is dusting off Soviet-era ventilator designs that lay forgotten in a mothballed military factory for years in a bid to ramp up domestic production of equipment that could help in the fight against the coronavirus.

In response to an urgent appeal by hospitals to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for ventilators, some of the country’s wealthiest men chipped in to buy machines from abroad.

But representatives of state defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom, which runs the state-run Burevisnyk plant in Kiev, are leading an initiative for Ukraine to boost domestic output based on technology developed there long ago.

Deputy Director General of Ukroboronprom, Mustafa Nayyem, told Reuters that a computer with the relevant technical information had disappeared and the engineers that designed the ventilators were retired or dead.

Eventually officials tracked down a man who knew where printouts for the designs were kept in the factory on yellowing paper. He was working in a local supermarket.

The plant is in no fit state to restart production, so Ukroboronprom will share the technology with interested private companies and has offered to help certify a new product quickly and provide production facilities, Nayyem said.

“We will give everyone access to this documentation because we understand that the crisis is now,” Nayyem said.

“If you ask me whether there is a wizard who can come in and do everything, I would like to believe in it, but I think that now we need to … accept that industry in this country has been allowed to die for decades.”

Hard Times



Some 20 years ago around 6,000 people worked at the Burevisnyk factory, producing hardware including radar systems for submarines. It also had a sideline making ventilators once used to treat Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan.

Falling demand since the end of the Soviet Union and a lack of state funding have pushed the plant into bankruptcy.

A handful of employees remain, including its acting director and security guards. The power and heating were cut off five years ago. The plaster on the walls is cracked and old machinery lies covered in dust.

Its last big government order for ventilators came in 2008, the plant’s Acting Director Vitaly Khodzitsky told Reuters. The plant used a bank loan to produce them, but the government money did not arrive and the plant never recouped its costs.

“In 2011, a bankruptcy case was filed, bank accounts were frozen and everything stopped,” Khodzitsky said, shivering from the cold inside the plant.

For a population of about 40 million people, Deputy Health Minister Viktor Lyashko said there were about 1,117 ventilators ready for coronavirus patients.

Governments around the world are scrambling to procure more of the breathing devices that can blow air and oxygen into the lungs. They are crucial for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe COVID-19, the disease coronavirus causes.

The number of coronavirus cases has reached 480 in Ukraine, with eleven deaths. The country is one of Europe’s poorest and health spending per capita is a fraction of its western peers.

“Unfortunately, we must admit that Ukraine’s healthcare system is not ready for it,” Health Minister Illia Yemets said.",,"['1,117 ventilators']",,

When Sudanese officials announced a series of measures last week to counter the spread of COVID-19, the distress on the health minister's face was telling: this pandemic is the last thing Sudan needs right now. Not even one year after protesters forced former dictator Omar al-Bashir to step down, the transitional government faces serious economic and political challenges that could jeopardize its plans for transition to civilian rule.

The government's efforts to fight against the pandemic could be crucial to the transition.

As of today, Sudan has seven confirmed cases of infection and two deaths. Given the lack of widespread testing, the numbers could be higher. In the coming weeks, they may overwhelm the already-challenged health sector.

Sudan’s health sector already faced serious challenges of corruption, underfunding, and mismanagement. Even before COVID-19, there was a shortage of nurses, critical care beds, and reportedly only 80 ventilators in the whole country. Donations of testing kits, masks, and protective gear from Chinese billionaire Jack Ma and the Alibaba foundation could ease the challenge but won't be sufficient.

Sudanese authorities have tried to act quickly in the face of the spreading virus. On January 28, authorities set up checkpoints to screen travelers at points of entry. On March 14, they closed schools and universities. Two days later, they closed the airports, ports, and land crossings, banned travel between states, and required quarantining for incoming travelers. The latest step was imposing a night curfew on March 23. Khartoum state banned all mass gatherings on March 20. On March 25, authorities released 4,217 prisoners as a precautionary measure to reduce risk of transmission in detention.

But these steps aren't enough. Sudan has a long list of poor and vulnerable populations such as refugees and displaced communities from the country's conflict zones, many of whom live in large camp settings. Half the population lives under the poverty line, and many work in the informal sector, such as tea-sellers and day laborers. They may not have the luxury of social distancing or staying home.

And restrictions on movement are making the economic situation worse, with commodity prices soaring across the country.

As authorities struggle to cope, they should focus on the most vulnerable: ramp up health services to crowded and under-serviced urban areas, provide water points and testing facilities, and increase public information about the virus.

The international donors who pledged to support Sudan's transition should recognize how critical this moment is and step up now. Even if the pandemic has slowed the pace of donor meetings and conferences, these governments need not let COVID-19 become yet another obstacle to Sudan's transition.",,['80 ventilators'],,
Sudan,,https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/quarantine-challenges-leave-sudan-vulnerable-amid-covid-spread,Quarantine Challenges Leave Sudan Vulnerable Amid COVID Spread,"KHARTOUM - Sudan has seen a small handful of coronavirus cases so far, and only one death. But health authorities are concerned because large numbers of people have either escaped quarantine or are refusing to quarantine altogether.



Two weeks have passed since authorities in Sudan confirmed the country’s first case of COVID-19.



So far, the country has avoided the epidemics seen in Italy, the United States and China.



But health officials are worried, because many people who were possibly exposed to the coronavirus are not cooperating with quarantine efforts.



In one incident, doctors and witnesses said some 300 people left quarantine at the Universal Hospital in Khartoum last week.



In another, four bus passengers left an isolation center near the border with Egypt.



Alfatih Osman, the director of the Ministry of Health, says quarantining can stop the spread of the coronavirus, if it is properly carried out.



""It is one of the most important procedures that we will execute. It’s generally proven that any health system can’t respond to the number of the infected people, if people don’t commit to the quarantine. We can’t face the medical needs of the possibly infected people and patients,"" Osman said.



So far, Africa has seen fewer than 1,000 confirmed case of COVID-19, but global public health experts are concerned about the potential for a wider spread on the continent.



The World Health Organization has listed Sudan as a risk for a pandemic spread due to a lack of preparatory procedures and health facilities.



In Khartoum, a group of doctors has launched a public campaign to raise awareness of the virus and the steps people must take to avoid infection.

Doctors are distributing free hand sanitizers and soap, and giving out information on social media and in cars with loudspeakers.



Abeer Dirar, one of the organizers behind the campaign, says as volunteers in defeating the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, they pay attention to the importance of the quarantine to stop the spread in Sudan. She said the country does not have the logistics to face this disease -- there are not enough ICU beds, because of the cumulative destruction of the health system over 30 years.



On the positive side, Sudan recently received 100,000 face masks, 20,000 test kits and 1,000 medical suits from a Chinese business man as a gift.



But local reports say Sudan has only 80 ICU units in both the public and private sector.



About 150 Sudanese students arrived early Friday from the United Arab Emirates after been evacuated from Wuhan province in China, the original epicenter of the pandemic.



The students, who were quarantined for three weeks in China, refused to be quarantined any longer and held a sit-in at the airport, saying they had already tested negative for the virus.



The Ministry of Health allowed them to return to their homes. But critics say if any of them are carrying the virus, they could put Sudan’s health system in a dire situation.","['20,000 test kits']",,,

Iraq's Communications and Media Commission (CMC) condemned the reporting, calling it ""astonishing"" in a statement on Thursday.

Reuters quoted three unnamed doctors along with anonymous health ministry and senior government officials as saying that thousands of people in Iraq had contracted COVID-19.

More:

The news report also said the number of deaths was much higher than publicly reported, and that Baghdad was concealing data from the public - allegations strongly rejected by Iraq's health ministry.

""It's incorrect information,"" said Saif al-Badr, the health ministry spokesman, in a text message sent to Reuters without elaborating.

The official death toll in Iraq from COVID-19 is 54, while the number of coronavirus cases totals 772.

In addition to temporarily revoking Reuter's licence, Iraq said it would impose a fine of about $21,000.

It also asked Reuters to issue an apology over the report that ""put social security at risk"". There was no immediate response from the news agency.

Expected spike

The World Health Organization (WHO) in Iraq said on Wednesday the number of COVID-19 cases in the country would rise sharply over the next 10 days as testing becomes more rigorous.

The figures in Iraq are ""still moderate so far but expect a spike in the coming weeks"" because of the increase in testing, said WHO's representative in Iraq, Adham Ismail, in an interview with Al-Ayyam TV, an Iraqi satellite channel.

""Three laboratories became operational for COVID-19 testing in Najaf, Basra and Baghdad Medical City in Baghdad,"" Ismail said.

""This has increased the numbers of tested cases to more than 4,500 tests a day, compared to a maximum of 100 a day a few weeks ago,"" he added.

Iraq introduced a curfew on March 17 and restrictions on travel as part of measures to contain the infections. It has since extended the nationwide curfew twice.

The country shares an extensive border with Iran, which has the highest number of cases in the Middle East. Iraq also suffers from an overstretched healthcare system after years of sanctions, war and neglect.

After first appearing in Wuhan, China in late December, the virus has spread to at least 181 countries and regions.

Data compiled by US-based Johns Hopkins University shows worldwide infections surpassed one million with more than 52,800 deaths. About 208,900 victims have recovered.

(Xinhua)

BAGHDAD, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The new PCR (polymerase chain reaction) lab built by the Chinese team of experts in the Iraqi capital Baghdad has completed around 720 tests on Sunday, relieving pressure for Iraq's Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) to identify COVID-19 after a technical problem occurred.

On March 25, the new PCR lab was inaugurated in the Medical City in downtown Baghdad, with the aim of increasing the urgently needed nucleic acid detection capacity to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in the war-torn country.

""We had a technical problem yesterday in the central lab,"" Mohammed Ghanim Mahdi, who is in charge of the new lab and also director of the National Center of the Teaching Laboratories of the Medical City, told Xinhua on Monday.

However, the CPHL's technical problem on Sunday evening prompted the PCR lab technicians to continue their work, which was supposed to end at 8 p.m., but they were forced to resume the work from 10 p.m.

""We have worked to compensate the delay of testing cases of the central lab, and we have received 560 samples from CPHL to test, in addition to 160 others received by our PCR lab received by the Medical City and from Rusafa health department to be tested by us in one day,"" Mahdi said, who has worked overnight with technicians in the lab and has not slept for 24 hours.

Mahdi said ""imagine if the technical problem happens without the existing of this new lab, it will be a disaster because there will be no results for a week or more.""

Earlier in the day, Yang Honghui, a member of the Chinese expert team and the technical director of Daan Gene Co., Ltd. of Sun Yat-sen University, gave guidance in the new PCR lab and went to the CPHL to check the technical problem.

Ghada Ghalib Falih, director of CPHL, told Xinhua last Thursday that the central lab has been operating to test COVID-19 under mounting pressure for dozens of days.

According to her, the number of testing conducted has gradually increased from around 20 to more than 400 suspected samples per day.

""You can imagine what is happening,"" Ghada said. ""All the experts, staff and machines are working; at night I have to say 'stop' otherwise the machine will be on fire.""

Ahead of the establishment of the new Chinese-built lab, CPHL is the only lab in Iraq that has the PCR ability to test and confirm COVID-19 cases, which is currently relying on diagnostic kits donated by the World Health Organization.

However, the central lab faces shortages of testing kits. Ghada expects to use the diagnostic kits soon brought by the Chinese team of experts.

Iraqi health experts hail the new Chinese-built lab is meant to be instrumental in increasing Iraq's ability to test larger number of suspected cases of COVID-19, and is planned to dramatically reduce the pressure on the central lab.

Iraqi Health Ministry on Monday confirmed 83 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total number of infections to 630. The death toll rose to 46.

The Iraqi government has taken several measures recently to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including extending a nationwide curfew to April 11.

In February, Afghanistan’s public health ministry designated the Afghan Japan Hospital in Kabul as the capital’s primary coronavirus treatment facility. But there was a problem: The hand sanitizer procured by the ministry and distributed throughout the hospital was tested and found to have zero alcohol content, two hospital staff members told The Intercept. The gel wouldn’t have rubbed ink off a white board, much less disinfected the hands of the hundreds of staff and patients. According to hospital staff, the sanitizer has since been disposed of and replaced by the World Health Organization. A WHO spokesperson acknowledged the existence of “inauthentic” sanitizer. There is also a startling shortage of coronavirus tests and ventilators. WHO gave Afghanistan 1,500 testing kits, but only two laboratories in the country are equipped with machines that can process the test samples. The United Arab Emirates and China are donating tens of thousands of additional kits, said Dr. Wahid Majrooh, a senior adviser to the Afghan minister of public health. There are also plans to expand the number of diagnostic laboratories from two to 12.

As of April 2, the country’s two designated coronavirus hospitals had only 12 working ventilators between them. Four of those were at a hospital in Herat, but as of last week, none had been installed, Dr. Nasir Farhang, a newly graduated medical doctor working at the hospital, told The Intercept. “We don’t have any staff that know how to operate the ventilators or intubate [patients],” Farhang said. The coronavirus pandemic couldn’t have hit Afghanistan at a worse time. The country’s top two candidates in the September 2019 presidential election have both claimed victory and held separate inauguration ceremonies. During a March 20 visit to Kabul, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to broker a resolution between Ashraf Ghani, whose election victory was recognized by the U.S., and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah. Days later, Pompeo announced that the State Department was cutting $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan this year. The political impasse also threatens to undermine a February 29 agreement signed by U.S. and Taliban representatives in Qatar which many hoped would lead to the end of the 19-year war. Herat, a city of about half a million, is tied to Iran by trade, culture, and as the port through which hundreds of thousands of Afghans pass annually, mostly young men heading to Iran to find work. That relationship has put Herat, which now has nearly three quarters of the country’s 258 positive cases, at the center of Afghanistan’s coronavirus crisis. Experts say that number represents only a fraction of the actual figure for infections. A senior adviser to the Afghan Ministry of Health told The Intercept that based on patient data, 90 to 95 percent of Afghanistan’s positive cases are in people who have recently returned from Iran, where nearly 50,000 cases have been recorded so far. The International Organization for Migration estimates that around 2.4 million Afghans are in Iran at any given time. The border has been a well-worn path for unskilled workers for decades. In recent years, with unemployment at 30 percent in Afghanistan, the flow has quickened. According to IOM, roughly 1,000 Afghan migrants per day were using the countries’ two major border crossings with Iran — in Herat and Nimruz Provinces — to return home between January and March, when the number spiked.

One day last week, 31-year-old Zabihullah crossed into Afghanistan from Iran on foot after several months working as a laborer there. After a two-hour minibus ride to the outskirts of Herat, he wove his way on foot through muddy puddles to another van that would carry him on to his home province of Faryab, where his expectations of finding work were minimal. “There is no solution,” he said. “I’ll be lying down at home.” In March, as thousands succumbed to the pandemic in Iran, worksites like Zabihullah’s closed down and more than 100,000 Afghan workers began returning home, knowing they’d never receive treatment in Iran if they became infected. As many as 15,000 crossed on some days in March, according to IOM. “It’s the only place in the world with such massive cross-border returns during Covid,” said Nick Bishop, who is heading IOM’s coronavirus response in Afghanistan. Returns on such a scale would put tens of thousands of families under severe financial stress at the best of times. Now, the returnees also threaten to upend Afghanistan’s fragile health care system and thrust the country into chaos unlike anything it’s seen in the past two decades of war. “Even before the global pandemic, humanitarian needs were immense due to decades of conflict [and] ongoing political instability,” Linda Tom, of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Afghanistan, told The Intercept. This year, she said, 9.4 million people — almost a quarter of Afghanistan’s population — are in need of humanitarian assistance.

Afghanistan’s porous borders make detecting and preventing the virus’s spread from neighboring countries virtually impossible. Fear and misinformation deter those with symptoms from seeking treatment, and Afghan homes typically host large, multigenerational families, making calls for social distancing unrealistic. At even greater risk are Afghanistan’s 4 million displaced people, who are too busy trying to survive poverty and upheaval to worry about a new virus. The Shahrak-e-Sabz settlement on the outskirts of Herat is home to more than 10,000 families, most of whom built single-room mud-brick homes after fleeing fighting and drought in Badghis Province, to the north, in 2018. On a cold, wet afternoon last week, the virus was well down the list of residents’ priorities. After two days of rain, roofs were leaking or caving in, and solar-powered water pumps had stopped working under the cloudy skies. Previously, several residents said, they had relied on humanitarian agencies for help in situations like this. But those agencies are now overwhelmingly focused on the coronavirus. Ghulam Sakhi, who runs a small store in the settlement, told The Intercept that nongovernmental organizations had come to the camp to inform them about the dangers of the pandemic. They “bring leaflets and say you must eat fruit for its Vitamin C,” he said outside his store, which is in a shipping container. “But we don’t even have bread.”

Above the gently sloping hill where thousands of mud-brick homes make up the settlement sits the 150-bed pediatric hospital that has been declared the region’s primary coronavirus treatment facility. Farhang, the recent graduate working at the hospital, told The Intercept last week that 56 Covid-19 patients out of what was at the time a countrywide total of 71 were being treated at the facility. A 45-year-old woman had died of the disease the night before, becoming the country’s second reported coronavirus death. The lack of health workers trained to operate ventilators in Herat isn’t just the result of an overstretched system dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. In 2018, an international medical professional, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, discovered two brand-new ventilators in Herat Regional Hospital. Both were emblazoned with large WHO stickers; neither was being used. A surgeon had covered them in a sheet to keep them clean and secure. “No one had been trained” on how to use them, the foreign health worker told The Intercept, noting that such lack of preparation was “typical.” And it wasn’t just ventilators. There were electric suction machines and cardiac monitors gathering dust because they were missing parts that weren’t available in Afghanistan, said the foreign health professional, who worked in the hospital at the time. “The crazy thing was I remember so many people dying because of the lack of ventilator beds in ICU.”

WHO informed Afghanistan’s Ministry of Public Health about the likely spread of the coronavirus in January. “When we received notification of cases in Qom, [Iran], we went to the zero point” at the border, Dr. Mohammad Asef Kabir, Herat’s deputy health minister, told The Intercept. Given the likelihood that the virus would cross into Herat with returning Afghans, the ministry’s initial efforts focused on detection and raising awareness about the need for good hygiene and social distancing. Such messaging, especially among vulnerable communities and those returning from Iran, is vital, IOM’s Nick Bishop said. “Based on socioeconomic status and levels of education, it’s going to be incredibly difficult to convey those messages in a meaningful way in the coming weeks when you’re really going to see exponential growth in the case count and, potentially, in the number of people dying.”

The Afghan government, for its part, has been comparatively aggressive in instituting containment measures. On March 25, with just over 50 positive cases recorded in Herat, the province’s governor shuttered nonessential stores and businesses and banned public gatherings; the same restrictions were imposed in Kabul a few days later. Schools were ordered to remain closed after the winter holiday on March 14 in an initial effort to slow the spread of the virus. But streets in the two cities now resemble a regular weekend, showing how difficult it will be to enforce wholesale behavioral change in a country where much of the population lives hand-to-mouth and is resigned to the knowledge that each day may be their last. As in China, Italy, Spain, and now the U.S., health facilities in Afghanistan are being converted into coronavirus treatment centers in anticipation of an onslaught of cases in the coming months. But the rollout has been plagued by staffing and equipment shortages which, if not resolved, will overwhelm the health system within weeks, according to local and international health professionals. An online advertisement posted by the public health ministry on March 29 listed 40 physician job vacancies. The Afghan Japan Hospital’s director, Dr. Atiqullah Kotay, said that staff will be required to work 24-hour shifts because of the transport disruptions wrought by the city’s partial lockdown. Still, he said it shouldn’t be hard to hire more health care workers. “In Afghanistan,” he said, “there are many medical professionals, but few jobs.” Afghanistan’s public health system “is definitely … very weak,” Médecins Sans Frontières Afghanistan Country Representative Julien Raickman told The Intercept. “It’s already a problem in normal times, but in the time of an epidemic, it will have a terrible impact.”

Some medical professionals and NGO workers have criticized WHO’s response. “Of course [WHO] always thinks that money is the answer,” a leading international health expert based in Kabul, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Intercept. “You can [have] all the money you want, but in the end, what for?” More important, this person and others said, are human resources and supplies, which were becoming increasingly difficult to procure as air travel and borders shut down. “We expected more,” Majrooh, the adviser to the minister of public health, told The Intercept. WHO’s Amadullah Amarkhil said a massive amount of long-term support will be required. “WHO is closely working with [the Ministry of Public Health] and assisting the Health Sector and its Partners since early January regarding COVID-19 on preparedness and has massively expanded its assistance in key areas,” he said in an email. Early one morning last week, a small queue of patients waited for a prediagnosis consultation in an outdoor area near the Herat Regional Hospital’s laboratory. The doctor, who wore a head-to-toe protective suit, was assisted by Mohammad Shafi Khotibi, a local nurse. On average, Khotibi explained, medical staff hold such consultations with about 100 patients daily, about 50 of whom are asked to give nose and throat swab samples for testing. The sampling kits are regularly replenished by the health ministry, but the process isn’t seamless. “Every time it runs out,” said Khotibi, “there is a gap of several hours.” (At the time of publication, according to the ministry, 1,807 tests had been performed nationwide.)

Afghanistan,,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/taliban-launches-campaign-afghanistan-fight-coronavirus-200406055113086.html,Taliban launches campaign to help Afghanistan fight coronavirus,"Kabul, Afghanistan - When 55-year-old Khairullah from a village in Afghanistan's northern Jawzjan province was invited to join a meeting after Friday prayers on March 27, he was not prepared for what he witnessed.

Despite the unusually cold spring weather, Khairullah, who asked for his name to be changed, and his neighbours were welcomed by Taliban fighters holding their AK-47s and dressed in complete medical PPE (personal protective equipment) for a workshop on the prevention of the coronavirus.

More:

""It's been about a week since the Taliban has been conducting such awareness campaigns here. They are asking people to use masks and gloves, talking about washing hands with soap, those kinds of things,"" Khairullah told Al Jazeera, in a phone call from his village in the Taliban-controlled Darzaab district.

""They have cancelled all public gatherings, weddings and have asked people to pray at home instead of the mosques,"" he added.

While Afghanistan has fewer than 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus, there are worries of an outbreak of the deadly virus in a country already facing years of conflict, displacement and poverty.

""We were directed by our health commission to hold public awareness campaigns, which we have undertaken in areas we control. We are also distributing pamphlets with advice on prevention of coronavirus in these districts,"" Qari Khalid Hijran, who described himself as the Taliban's newly-appointed director of public health of the Baghlan province, told Al Jazeera.

Government welcomes move

200122194509687

As surreal as it was for many Afghans, the Taliban's initiative was welcomed by the country's Ministry of Public Health.

""We noticed photos circulating on social media that show the Taliban's campaign, and regardless of their intention, we appreciate the cooperation from anyone or any group that supports the fight against coronavirus,"" Wahidullah Mayar, adviser to the Ministry of Public Health, told Al Jazeera.

Visuals shared by Khairullah and the Taliban of the coronavirus workshops show men dressed in white medical gear and masks, holding disinfectant sprays as well as heavy weapons, as they gather around large posters of instructions on avoiding the coronavirus.

The Taliban flag and insignia were also visible in some of those photos.

The printed material, issued by the Taliban's ""General Commission for Public Health"", listed precautions that people should take, including regular prayers, eating ""halal"" as well as medical advice.

""We also provided villagers a list of vegetables that contain high amounts of vitamin C to boost immunity,"" Hijran said.

While there are concerns over the Taliban's ""health commission"" providing information that meets medical standards, Mayar said his ministry was also running simultaneous campaigns in all provinces.

""We provide healthcare services in all provinces through trained health workers and 26 partner NGOs, even in Taliban areas. So there are professional medical workers that Afghans can turn to,"" he said.

Safe passage to health workers

The Taliban has also offered safe passage to health workers and international organisations working to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Afghanistan.

""We are willing to allow and support government health workers or NGOs who can help the villagers in our areas. All they have to do is ask for our permission before coming so we can assess them, and we will let them work here,"" said Hijran, adding that they were ""ready to accept any help for the sake of people"".

Only last year, the Taliban had banned operations by the World Health Organization and the Red Cross in areas it controlled, citing ""suspicious activities"". It later partially lifted the Red Cross ban.

Many Afghans also hope that the Taliban takes this opportunity to act on a United Nations call for a ceasefire in all conflict zones, due to the pandemic.

""The Taliban mentioned that if there is a [COVID-19] positive case, it will impose a ceasefire in that region. I ask them on behalf of the ministry to call for a ceasefire in the whole country,"" said Mayar. ""Let us fight this disease together instead of fighting each other.""

However, despite its public service campaign, the Taliban continues to attack Afghan forces, often claiming civilian lives.

A recent peace deal signed with the United States to end the 18-year war amid hopes for negotiations with the Afghan government have done little to prevent those attacks.

""They coronavirus hasn't affected the conflict much. There is still fighting in many areas, and unless the fighting stops, the doctors and health teams can't openly work in these areas,"" Khairullah said.

Taliban quarantines virus suspects

Khairullah added that resources in his village were thinly stretched amid the pandemic.

200405185652146

""There is only one health centre in our district with 10 beds and a few health workers. Medicine supplies are low and I heard that the Taliban has also requested government officials to bring more medicines,"" he told Al Jazeera.

While the Taliban may not have stopped fighting, the group says it has taken the coronavirus threat seriously by moving its fighters from the battlefields for the COVID-19 campaign.

The group has enforced lockdowns in affected areas and even quarantined those suspected of having the virus, especially Afghan refugees returning from Iran, the worst-hit Middle East country.

""About two weeks ago, they quarantined two villagers who had returned from Iran. They were not allowed to leave their homes and were later tested,"" said Khairullah.

In some northern provinces, the Taliban even detained returnees from Iran who had escaped government quarantine facilities.

About two million Afghan refugees live in Iran, with thousands among them being deported to the shared western border in Herat province, making it the epicentre of Afghanistan's coronavirus outbreak.

Of the nearly 400 cases in Afghanistan, more than 200 are from Herat alone, with seven deaths so far.

Hijran confirmed to Al Jazeera that the Taliban was quarantining and even testing Afghan citizens.

""We have health centres in our areas… in Baghlan, we have two centres. We check returnees in these health centres and even if they test negative, we lock them in homes for 20 days,"" he said, adding that the group had conducted 135 tests in Baghlan province so far.

Testing kits available

Hijran also said the Taliban had COVID-19 testing kits, a shortage of which has been a matter of concern for Afghan health workers and organisations.

Fewer tests have made it difficult for the Afghan government to address the magnitude of the pandemic.

""We were provided 950 kits for Baghlan province from the Taliban health commission,"" Hijran said, without revealing who provided the kits to the group.

For civilians like Khairullah though, the Taliban's health initiatives, limited as they might be, provided a much-needed assurance to the people amid the crisis.

""This virus threatens all of us, whether Taliban or civilians or government,"" he said.",['135 tests'],,,

Several U.S. troops in Afghanistan are experiencing flu-like symptoms but have tested negative for influenza, according to Rep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat. Now, there are concerns the troops, who are 75 miles from Iran where the coronavirus is rampant, could have COVID-19, he said.

The troops have not yet been tested for the sometimes-deadly virus though, Pocan added. The congressman said he learned of the situation after one of the service members' families contacted his office.

""If we're not providing proper health care to military personnel, especially so close to where there is a real flare of the pandemic near Iran ... that would be awful,"" Pocan told Military.com.

Related: Guard Activations in Response to Coronavirus Expected to Hit 1,000 by Weekend

The congressman declined to name the military base in Afghanistan where the troops are sick, citing concerns the service member's family had about coming forward. Herat province in Afghanistan has several positive cases of coronavirus, and the military has troops operating there.

The Defense Department did not respond to questions about the situation. Officials at U.S. Central Command referred questions to the public affairs office for NATO's Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan. That office also did not respond to questions.

As of Thursday, Pocan said he hasn't received clarity from the Defense Department on whether test kits are being provided to troops overseas. He said he finds the fact that he can't get a basic answer to that question for troops serving in far-flung locations ""very concerning.""

""If anyone is putting their life on the line for us overseas in the military, we really should be providing the health care that they deserve,"" Pocan told Military.com. ""We fear they're not [getting] that.""

Coronavirus cases topped 125,000 worldwide on Friday. The National Guard is expected to mobilize 1,000 troops across six states by the weekend as President Donald Trump declared the pandemic a national emergency.

Pocan pointed to widespread concerns over the way the U.S. is administering coronavirus tests. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told members of Congress this week that was ""a failing.""

""The system is not really geared to what we need right now,"" he said. ""... That is a failing. It is a failing. Let's admit it.""

Pocan pointed to aggressive testing in South Korea, which was able to slow the spread of new cases. Military members and their families don't need the added stress of not having access to coronavirus tests, he said, especially when they're deployed.

Army Gen. Robert ""Abe"" Abrams, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, told reporters Friday that troops in South Korea have had access to coronavirus tests.

So far, 145 people connected to that command have been tested, including troops, family members, and civilian and contractor workers. Nine people have tested positive for coronavirus.

Abrams touted the efficacy of testing in that country, which quickly sped up how it could test for the virus. More than 189,000 South Korean citizens have now been tested at more than 100 testing centers.

""The Republic of Korea, learning from previous pandemic experience, revamped their system,"" he said. ""Three weeks ago, they could do about 5,000 tests a day. Today, they can do about 18K tests a day.

""We can get as many tested as necessary,"" Abrams added.

In a press conference Trump held Friday, government and health industry leaders pledged to make coronavirus testing more readily available.

Above the gently sloping hill where thousands of mud-brick homes make up the settlement sits the 150-bed pediatric hospital that has been declared the region’s primary coronavirus treatment facility. Farhang, the recent graduate working at the hospital, told The Intercept last week that 56 Covid-19 patients out of what was at the time a countrywide total of 71 were being treated at the facility. A 45-year-old woman had died of the disease the night before, becoming the country’s second reported coronavirus death. The lack of health workers trained to operate ventilators in Herat isn’t just the result of an overstretched system dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. In 2018, an international medical professional, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, discovered two brand-new ventilators in Herat Regional Hospital. Both were emblazoned with large WHO stickers; neither was being used. A surgeon had covered them in a sheet to keep them clean and secure. “No one had been trained” on how to use them, the foreign health worker told The Intercept, noting that such lack of preparation was “typical.” And it wasn’t just ventilators. There were electric suction machines and cardiac monitors gathering dust because they were missing parts that weren’t available in Afghanistan, said the foreign health professional, who worked in the hospital at the time. “The crazy thing was I remember so many people dying because of the lack of ventilator beds in ICU.”

WHO informed Afghanistan’s Ministry of Public Health about the likely spread of the coronavirus in January. “When we received notification of cases in Qom, [Iran], we went to the zero point” at the border, Dr. Mohammad Asef Kabir, Herat’s deputy health minister, told The Intercept. Given the likelihood that the virus would cross into Herat with returning Afghans, the ministry’s initial efforts focused on detection and raising awareness about the need for good hygiene and social distancing. Such messaging, especially among vulnerable communities and those returning from Iran, is vital, IOM’s Nick Bishop said. “Based on socioeconomic status and levels of education, it’s going to be incredibly difficult to convey those messages in a meaningful way in the coming weeks when you’re really going to see exponential growth in the case count and, potentially, in the number of people dying.”

The Afghan government, for its part, has been comparatively aggressive in instituting containment measures. On March 25, with just over 50 positive cases recorded in Herat, the province’s governor shuttered nonessential stores and businesses and banned public gatherings; the same restrictions were imposed in Kabul a few days later. Schools were ordered to remain closed after the winter holiday on March 14 in an initial effort to slow the spread of the virus. But streets in the two cities now resemble a regular weekend, showing how difficult it will be to enforce wholesale behavioral change in a country where much of the population lives hand-to-mouth and is resigned to the knowledge that each day may be their last. As in China, Italy, Spain, and now the U.S., health facilities in Afghanistan are being converted into coronavirus treatment centers in anticipation of an onslaught of cases in the coming months. But the rollout has been plagued by staffing and equipment shortages which, if not resolved, will overwhelm the health system within weeks, according to local and international health professionals. An online advertisement posted by the public health ministry on March 29 listed 40 physician job vacancies. The Afghan Japan Hospital’s director, Dr. Atiqullah Kotay, said that staff will be required to work 24-hour shifts because of the transport disruptions wrought by the city’s partial lockdown. Still, he said it shouldn’t be hard to hire more health care workers. “In Afghanistan,” he said, “there are many medical professionals, but few jobs.” Afghanistan’s public health system “is definitely … very weak,” Médecins Sans Frontières Afghanistan Country Representative Julien Raickman told The Intercept. “It’s already a problem in normal times, but in the time of an epidemic, it will have a terrible impact.”

Some medical professionals and NGO workers have criticized WHO’s response. “Of course [WHO] always thinks that money is the answer,” a leading international health expert based in Kabul, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Intercept. “You can [have] all the money you want, but in the end, what for?” More important, this person and others said, are human resources and supplies, which were becoming increasingly difficult to procure as air travel and borders shut down. “We expected more,” Majrooh, the adviser to the minister of public health, told The Intercept. WHO’s Amadullah Amarkhil said a massive amount of long-term support will be required. “WHO is closely working with [the Ministry of Public Health] and assisting the Health Sector and its Partners since early January regarding COVID-19 on preparedness and has massively expanded its assistance in key areas,” he said in an email. Early one morning last week, a small queue of patients waited for a prediagnosis consultation in an outdoor area near the Herat Regional Hospital’s laboratory. The doctor, who wore a head-to-toe protective suit, was assisted by Mohammad Shafi Khotibi, a local nurse. On average, Khotibi explained, medical staff hold such consultations with about 100 patients daily, about 50 of whom are asked to give nose and throat swab samples for testing. The sampling kits are regularly replenished by the health ministry, but the process isn’t seamless. “Every time it runs out,” said Khotibi, “there is a gap of several hours.” (At the time of publication, according to the ministry, 1,807 tests had been performed nationwide.)

Despite the unusually cold spring weather, Khairullah, who asked for his name to be changed, and his neighbours were welcomed by Taliban fighters holding their AK-47s and dressed in complete medical PPE (personal protective equipment) for a workshop on the prevention of the coronavirus.

More:

""It's been about a week since the Taliban has been conducting such awareness campaigns here. They are asking people to use masks and gloves, talking about washing hands with soap, those kinds of things,"" Khairullah told Al Jazeera, in a phone call from his village in the Taliban-controlled Darzaab district.

""They have cancelled all public gatherings, weddings and have asked people to pray at home instead of the mosques,"" he added.

While Afghanistan has fewer than 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus, there are worries of an outbreak of the deadly virus in a country already facing years of conflict, displacement and poverty.

""We were directed by our health commission to hold public awareness campaigns, which we have undertaken in areas we control. We are also distributing pamphlets with advice on prevention of coronavirus in these districts,"" Qari Khalid Hijran, who described himself as the Taliban's newly-appointed director of public health of the Baghlan province, told Al Jazeera.

Government welcomes move

200122194509687

As surreal as it was for many Afghans, the Taliban's initiative was welcomed by the country's Ministry of Public Health.

""We noticed photos circulating on social media that show the Taliban's campaign, and regardless of their intention, we appreciate the cooperation from anyone or any group that supports the fight against coronavirus,"" Wahidullah Mayar, adviser to the Ministry of Public Health, told Al Jazeera.

Visuals shared by Khairullah and the Taliban of the coronavirus workshops show men dressed in white medical gear and masks, holding disinfectant sprays as well as heavy weapons, as they gather around large posters of instructions on avoiding the coronavirus.

The Taliban flag and insignia were also visible in some of those photos.

The printed material, issued by the Taliban's ""General Commission for Public Health"", listed precautions that people should take, including regular prayers, eating ""halal"" as well as medical advice.

""We also provided villagers a list of vegetables that contain high amounts of vitamin C to boost immunity,"" Hijran said.

While there are concerns over the Taliban's ""health commission"" providing information that meets medical standards, Mayar said his ministry was also running simultaneous campaigns in all provinces.

""We provide healthcare services in all provinces through trained health workers and 26 partner NGOs, even in Taliban areas. So there are professional medical workers that Afghans can turn to,"" he said.

Safe passage to health workers

The Taliban has also offered safe passage to health workers and international organisations working to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Afghanistan.

""We are willing to allow and support government health workers or NGOs who can help the villagers in our areas. All they have to do is ask for our permission before coming so we can assess them, and we will let them work here,"" said Hijran, adding that they were ""ready to accept any help for the sake of people"".

Only last year, the Taliban had banned operations by the World Health Organization and the Red Cross in areas it controlled, citing ""suspicious activities"". It later partially lifted the Red Cross ban.

Many Afghans also hope that the Taliban takes this opportunity to act on a United Nations call for a ceasefire in all conflict zones, due to the pandemic.

""The Taliban mentioned that if there is a [COVID-19] positive case, it will impose a ceasefire in that region. I ask them on behalf of the ministry to call for a ceasefire in the whole country,"" said Mayar. ""Let us fight this disease together instead of fighting each other.""

However, despite its public service campaign, the Taliban continues to attack Afghan forces, often claiming civilian lives.

A recent peace deal signed with the United States to end the 18-year war amid hopes for negotiations with the Afghan government have done little to prevent those attacks.

""They coronavirus hasn't affected the conflict much. There is still fighting in many areas, and unless the fighting stops, the doctors and health teams can't openly work in these areas,"" Khairullah said.

Taliban quarantines virus suspects

Khairullah added that resources in his village were thinly stretched amid the pandemic.

200405185652146

""There is only one health centre in our district with 10 beds and a few health workers. Medicine supplies are low and I heard that the Taliban has also requested government officials to bring more medicines,"" he told Al Jazeera.

While the Taliban may not have stopped fighting, the group says it has taken the coronavirus threat seriously by moving its fighters from the battlefields for the COVID-19 campaign.

The group has enforced lockdowns in affected areas and even quarantined those suspected of having the virus, especially Afghan refugees returning from Iran, the worst-hit Middle East country.

""About two weeks ago, they quarantined two villagers who had returned from Iran. They were not allowed to leave their homes and were later tested,"" said Khairullah.

In some northern provinces, the Taliban even detained returnees from Iran who had escaped government quarantine facilities.

About two million Afghan refugees live in Iran, with thousands among them being deported to the shared western border in Herat province, making it the epicentre of Afghanistan's coronavirus outbreak.

Of the nearly 400 cases in Afghanistan, more than 200 are from Herat alone, with seven deaths so far.

Hijran confirmed to Al Jazeera that the Taliban was quarantining and even testing Afghan citizens.

""We have health centres in our areas… in Baghlan, we have two centres. We check returnees in these health centres and even if they test negative, we lock them in homes for 20 days,"" he said, adding that the group had conducted 135 tests in Baghlan province so far.

Testing kits available

Hijran also said the Taliban had COVID-19 testing kits, a shortage of which has been a matter of concern for Afghan health workers and organisations.

Fewer tests have made it difficult for the Afghan government to address the magnitude of the pandemic.

""We were provided 950 kits for Baghlan province from the Taliban health commission,"" Hijran said, without revealing who provided the kits to the group.

For civilians like Khairullah though, the Taliban's health initiatives, limited as they might be, provided a much-needed assurance to the people amid the crisis.

A new study has found that Poland has the highest proportion of hospital beds for elderly people in Europe.

The large number of beds for people aged 70+ could help the country in its battle with Covid-19.

The research also revealed that Poland has 6.62 hospital beds per 1,000 residents of all ages, putting it in fifth place on a league headed by Germany, which has 8.00 beds.Andrzej Grygiel/PAP

The illness, which at the time of writing has so far claimed 14 lives in Poland, has far higher fatality rates in older age groups.

According to a new report by NimbleFins, a UK-based market research company, Poland has 60.52 beds for every 1,000 people aged over 70, the highest number in Europe and almost three times the number in the countries with the lowest number of beds.

Italy, the country in Europe worst affected by the coronavirus, has only 19.1 beds, the United Kingdom 19.5 and Spain 21.1.

Looking at data from Eurostat, the OECD and Worldometer on Covid-19 fatalities, populations and hospital beds, NimbleFins found that Poland has 251,406 beds for a population of 4,154,388 people aged 70 and over.

The illness, which at the time of writing has so far claimed 14 lives in Poland, has far higher fatality rates in older age groups.Leszek Szymański/PAP

The data in the report shows that 14.8 percent of all Covid-19 fatalities were in the 80+ age group, and 8 percent in the 70-79 age group, while for those under 40 the death rate is just 0.4, which means somebody over 80 is 74 times more likely to succumb to the disease than somebody under 40.

COVID-19 cases may peak in 2-3 weeks, Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Monday assessing the coronavirus situation in Poland.

Szumowski told the TVN24 private news channel that, by the end of this week, there would be between 1,500 and 2,000 coronavirus infections in Poland, with up to 10,000 confirmed cases possible in two weeks' time.

Szumowski said that his duty as health minister was to prepare the national healthcare system for a marked rise in infections, and appealed to Poles to ""take their role seriously"" and remain at home, as a safety precaution against the disease.

Szumowski stated that it was important to curb the infections as much as possible, as this would give those people who were already infected a chance to recuperate faster than new infections could appear. He added that Poland should not repeat Italy's initial mistake of ignoring the virus.

Szumowski said that more clinics were being transformed into infectious disease hospitals, with decisions already confirmed with regard to 17 clinics. He added that there were currently 10,000 hospital beds and 700 ventilators available countrywide, and that a further 300 ventilators were needed.

Szumowski stated that staff in such hospitals would undergo training before the main wave of infections arrives. He added that the clinics would receive sufficient supplies of protective masks and other equipment.

Szumowski said labs countrywide were able to carry out up to 3,000 coronavirus tests every 24 hours, and reported that, as of now, all persons showing coronavirus symptoms would be tested.

Asked if there were chances for an effective drug or a vaccine against the disease, Szumowski said a vaccine might be available in the distant future, in 18 months at the earliest, while work on a functional drug was still underway with ""some slightly promising results.""

""As for a drug, there may be work underway on this and, in effect, if we could use a certain drug, we might have better chances (...), with the disease taking a milder course. This is what we are waiting for, a ray of hope. We have had some slightly promising results with several formulas, but we are still waiting for confirmation, because there is no point in arousing false hopes,"" Szumowski said.",,"['700 ventilators', '300 ventilators']","['10,000 hospital beds']",

Is that enough?","In Ottawa on Wednesday, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam once again stressed the need to flatten the curve of the virus' spread, pointing to a ""sharp rise in cases"" during the past week. ""This is a signal there is some degree of community spread,"" she said. ""Our time to act is now.""

As of Wednesday evening, Canada had recorded nearly 730 confirmed and presumptive cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, including a first death reported in Quebec earlier that day.

Though the numbers are clearly increasing, health experts say it’s hard to know how many cases there actually are in Canada, since not everyone with symptoms is being tested. But they disagree about how much the real numbers matter. Some point out that the available data shows the rate of spread, if not the total number of people infected, and say as long as people with symptoms self-isolate, Canada has a chance to slow transmission of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.

Others counter that people are less likely to self-isolate if they don’t know whether they have Covid-19, and argue it’s much harder to control the virus when you don’t know exactly where it is.

David Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto’s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said testing is the best way to get control of an epidemic early. By the time people start to die, he said, there have likely been generations of transmission that have gone undetected. “And that’s how you get completely hosed by this,” he said.

“The testing is kind of our eyes and ears in terms of what’s happening. … I think we’re missing a ton of this stuff.”

Fisman said the real number of cases in Canada could be much larger than the number on the books. “We have the sense that our positives are increasing exponentially,” he said. “The question is what fraction of the true total cases does that represent.”

Moreover, the cases being confirmed today are likely people who got sick a week ago or more, said University of Toronto epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Kwong. “In an ideal world, we would be testing everybody,” he said. “It’s just the reality is we don’t have the resources to do that.”

Ottawa’s medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, has warned there could be hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the city, though there is still no proof of community transmission. Fisman said that may well be the case in many Canadian cities.

Even if the confirmed cases are a significant underestimate, though, they still give a sense of the virus’ trajectory, said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre. “I think that as long as we keep doing the same thing … the numbers from one day to the next are telling us something about how the epidemic is growing,” he said.

Canada is “actually doing a really good job” at testing, given limited resources, said Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses. “I don’t think the overall accuracy of the definitive numbers is really important at this stage,” he said, pointing instead to the importance of social distancing and self-isolation to flatten the curve of the virus' spread.

Still, Dr. William Cherniak, an emergency room physician who has been testing patients for Covid-19 for about a month, said the ideal solution would be a test that people could administer themselves. “My thing is always that knowledge is power,” he said. Self-isolation would be effective “if people really stayed at home for 14 days if they had the symptoms,” he said. But if they haven’t been diagnosed with Covid-19, he believes, they’re less likely to take those instructions seriously.

On Wednesday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced Canada has approved two new diagnostic tests to allow provincial labs to expand testing. “Early diagnosis is a critical component of slowing down the spread of the illness and Canadians can be encouraged that Canada has been leading in terms of our testing capacity,” she said.

Certainly, Canada has been doing more testing than the U.S., relative to population size. Tam said Wednesday that more than 50,000 people have been tested for Covid-19 in Canada. Meanwhile, the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run accounting of every coronavirus test administered in the U.S., was reporting a total of about 76,000 tests on Wednesday evening, for a population 10 times the size of Canada's. Still, Canada’s efforts don’t compare to the work being done in South Korea, which now has the ability to test up to 20,000 people a day.

What many Canadians are watching for these days is whether this country is on the same trajectory as Italy was a few weeks ago, before its hospitals were flooded with patients needing emergency care.

If Canada has any chance of avoiding that, Kindrachuk said, now is the time to take social distancing seriously, regardless of the exact number of cases. “It’s the calm before the storm in a lot of ways. We cannot become complacent,” he said. “If we don’t do anything different, we know where this is going.”","['76,000 tests']",,,

When Amanda developed a fever, sore throat, and dry cough at the end of March she immediately thought of one thing: the new coronavirus.

With Canada, and much of the world in lockdown amid the deadly pandemic, she went online to the Ontario Ministry of Health website to see if she needed to be tested — it told her she didn’t.

“The fear is that if I get a severe version of this illness I will need a lengthy hospitalization and I have two young children,” said Amanda, who agreed to speak with Global News on the condition of using a pseudonym.

“But I hadn’t technically been in direct contact with someone who had travelled, or who had been diagnosed as being positive.

Amanda, an attorney in Toronto, self-isolated for 14 days and, along with millions of other Canadians, is working from home. But she is left wondering if she did in fact, have COVID-19.

“When I looked into it a little bit further, I discovered that the reason [that she was not advised to be tested] is that in Ontario there is a lack of testing,” she said.

Provinces like Ontario, Alberta and B.C., have limited who is being tested for COVID-19 amid a shortage of testing swabs, reduced lab capacity and a lack of reagents — the specific chemicals needed by labs to complete the tests. The priority, for now, is front-line health care workers showing symptoms, hospitalized patients or recent travellers.

But experts worry that narrow focus will cause health officials to miss hundreds or even thousands of cases and Canada may not know whether it is truly “flattening the curve.”

“We would like to see greater access to testing so that we aren’t left in a situation where there’s uncertainty around whether a particular person may or may not have the disease,” said Peter Phillips, a clinical professor specializing in infectious diseases at the University of British Columbia. “And that applies to even people with mild disease in the community.”

Phillips said that while a positive test may not necessarily change treatment, it’s important in terms of managing community spread as people generally become more compliant with self-isolation.

Sean Wormsbecke, an emergency doctor at Royal Columbian Hospital in New Westminster, B.C, said he sends several COVID-19 cases home without testing — given current guidelines.

“There isn’t currently a tracking system for those cases that don’t warrant admission to hospital,” he said, noting that he can’t be certain they are COVID-19. “But I’m seeing patients who have the exact same symptom profile, in terms of how they describe their cough, how they describe shortness of breath.”

He urged people to take social distance seriously and to follow all self-isolation protocols.

Nearly two-thirds of reported COVID-19 cases in Canada as of March 28 are related to community spread, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, meaning a case that results from the virus being passed within a community, rather than being contracted through someone who has recently travelled.

“It’s more likely that if their friends and family know [a person] is positive they’re going to stay away,” he said. “And if you don’t have that information, then it’s likely there are going be breaches of the self-isolation protocol.”

Global health experts have pointed to South Korea as​ one of the few countries to contain the oubreak, reporting just 89 new cases of the novel coronavirus Thursday, down from 101 new cases a day earlier, and seemingly flattening the curve of new infections.

“They had very aggressive testing and they went after these cases and did very detailed contact tracing, including the use of cell phone and credit card data,” Phillips said.

Canada, meanwhile, is acquiring almost 1,000 new cases a day and has over 9,700 cases and over 110 deaths as of Thursday morning.

“We’re blowing right by South Korea,” Phillips said. “We’re going to have way more cases.”

Canada has tested more than 255,000 people for a per capita rate of 650 tests per 100,000, well ahead of Italy and the U.S. the hardest hit by COVID-19, but well back of South Korea who has done roughly 800 per capita.

Since its first case in February, Iceland has launched ambitious testing for the virus. Anyone on the island – home to about 364,000 people – can get tested. They do not need to have recently travelled abroad or even have to be showing any symptoms.

As a result, about five per cent of the population has been tested.

Dawn Bowdish, Canada Research Chair in aging and immunity at McMaster University, said Canada tested “aggressively” in the early months of January to February, but ran into trouble as global supply chains became squeezed.

“In the very, very early days, we were on the higher end of average for testing,” she said. “At the time, most of our cases were travel-related or they were with contacts of people who had travelled. “

As countries began to fight for limited supplies of nasal swabs and chemicals needed to do the tests, provinces, especially Ontario which had high case numbers in Toronto, started to limit testing.

“At that point, compromises had to be made and I believe that our public health agencies are doing the best they can with what they have,” Bowdish said.

And now with more cases appearing to be asymptomatic, meaning people are displaying little or no symptoms, there are calls for testing to be widened.

“One of the compromises is that we are not testing as widely as I’m sure everyone in public health would like,” Bowdish said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also announced a $74-million investment in a new made-in-Canada testing technology to help provinces increase testing capacity.

Alberta and Ontario also announced they signed deals with Spartan Bioscience Inc., an Ottawa-based company, that produces a portable DNA analyzer that can provide COVID-19 test results in about 30 minutes.

However, it remains unclear when provinces can start using the technology as it has not yet been approved by Health Canada. The company said in a statement it expects to begin shipping thousands of test kits to provinces “soon.”

Ontario has faced criticism for its slow testing rate, with the lowest per-capita testing rate in the country at about 350 per 100,000 people, despite having nearly 40 per cent of Canada’s population.

“We are surging the system and testing as many people as possible,” Premier Doug Ford told reporters Monday during a press conference. “We need more kits to get out there, but it’s not as quick as we would like.”

Canada,,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52161032,Coronavirus: US 'wants 3M to end mask exports to Canada and Latin America',"Image copyright Reuters

A major US mask manufacturer, 3M, says the government has asked it to stop exporting US-made N95 respirator masks to Canada and Latin America.

The request had ""significant humanitarian implications"", it warned, and could prompt other countries to act in kind.

On Thursday, the US invoked the Korean War-era Defence Production Act to demand that 3M provide more masks.

Canada's prime minister said stopping 3M's exports would be a ""mistake"".

President Donald Trump said he had used the Defence Production Act to ""hit 3M hard"", without providing additional details. The law dates back to 1950 and allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence.

In a statement on Friday, 3M said the government had invoked the act ""to require 3M to prioritise orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) for our N95 respirators"", and had also requested that 3M import more respirators made in its overseas factories into the US. It said it supported both moves.

However, 3M added that the government also requested that it stop exporting respirators made in the US to Canada and Latin America.

""There are significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators,"" it said.

3M added that such a move ""would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same"", which would lead to the overall number of respirators being made available to the US decreasing.

The company says it manufactures about 100 million N95 masks per month - about a third are made in the US, and the rest produced overseas.

The Trump administration has not provided details on its communications with 3M. On Thursday night, Mr Trump tweeted: ""We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their masks... Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!""

Meanwhile, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Thursday: ""We've had issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world, enough of it is coming back here.""

A shortage of beds during periods of peak demand, like the flu season, is a longstanding problem in the publicly funded system. While health spending has risen gradually in recent years, beds have not kept pace with population growth.

“You’ve got people in broom closets and auditoriums and conference rooms across the country,” said Michael Gardam, chief of staff at one Ontario’s newest hospitals, the 656-bed Humber River Hospital.

Canada has 925 cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and 12 deaths.

A preliminary model published by Canadian researchers this week estimated that if cases increase by 7.5 percent each day, Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will run out of ICU beds and ventilators in about 37 days.

Between Sunday and Thursday, daily case counts grew an average of 16% a day.

In British Columbia, which has seen the most virus-linked deaths in Canada, the majority of hospitals are running between 110% and 140% of their official capacity, said Christine Sorensen, president of the BC Nurses’ Union.

Most current Canadian hospitals were built between the 1940-1960s, under a federal program. Budget cuts forced closures, and in recent years, growing demand for long-term care has further strained the system.

Canada had 12.9 adult intensive care beds per 100,000 people, according to a study based on 2013-14 data, with variations across the country. British Columbia had only 10.5 beds, and the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador had 21.8, according to a report from Canadian Institute for Health Information.

Quebec’s government recently said it has 1,000 ICU beds, or 11.8 per 100,000.

In contrast, the United States had 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 as of 2009, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information.

CARE BY EMAIL AND IN HOTELS

With little time left to prepare, officials are moving to make the most of what they have.

British Columbia’s College of Physicians and Surgeons put a call out to doctors who retired in the last two years to re-register under a special emergency class.

Ontario told hospitals this week to ramp down elective surgeries and non-urgent treatment. It also said it would invest C$100 million to increase capacity, but it is not clear how quickly that can be done.

An Ontario committee set up to address the crisis is looking at how to move more patients out of hospitals and into long-term care or home with care, a document obtained by Reuters showed.

Alberta is enabling doctors to bill for phone consultations, in an effort to keep patients at home.

Its College of Physicians and Surgeons told doctors that unregulated technology, like email and texting, may be justified under the “extraordinary circumstances.”

Some hospitals have the capacity to re-open beds that have been closed over the years, said Michael Hurley, president of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, but that is not occurring quickly enough.

“So far we haven’t talked about approaching this virus with the intensity that the Chinese have,” said Hurley, citing China’s move to open up thousands of hospital beds in a matter of days to handle the influx of coronavirus patients. China assembled new hospitals in Wuhan using prefabricated buildings.

One top priority will be protecting healthcare workers, for their own safety and so they can continue to see patients.

“It’s going to be a burden on the staff; it’s going to be a burden on the system,” said Paul-Émile Cloutier, president of hospital advocacy group HealthCareCAN.

“The challenges of COVID-19 underscore the challenges that already exist in the system.”",,,"['1,000 ICU beds']",

As the global demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) continues to grow amid the novel coroanvirus outbreak, Canada’s chief public health officer says the country is looking into whether or not some of these supplies can be reused.

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, Dr. Theresa Tam, said officials are “looking at multiple entities in Canada” that might be able to properly disinfect medical masks.

She said if the supplies can be properly disinfected, officials will be able to tell provinces and territories which items shouldn’t be thrown away, in an effort to preserve Canada’s stock.

“I think that it is one of the most important, and I think worthwhile, lines of pursuit for PPE right now,” Tam said.

Asked by reporters just how dire the shortage of masks is in Canada, Tam said the situation is dynamic, with the available supply changing every time supplies are utilized or delivered.

She said, though, that measures taken in some regions to designate wards, or areas of hospitals just to treat COVID-19 patients has been helpful for rationing the PPE.

“Because it’ll be one specific area, one specific hospital where patients are being looked after so that they can look after that supply of the PPE,” she explained.

But, Tam said ultimately, protecting health care workers is the “absolute priority” and that the government has pulled out all the stops to ensure they are protected.

Research underway

Last week, researchers at the University of Manitoba announced they may have found a way to reuse N95 masks up to 10 times.

The researchers tested four different types of N95 masks with four different sterilization methods including repeated cycles of standard autoclaving, ethylene oxide gassing, ionized hydrogen peroxide fogging, and vaporized hydrogen peroxide treatment.

According to a release from the U of M, the results show several of the decontamination methods can be used repeatedly without degrading the masks’ effectiveness.

The study has yet to be peer-review or be published in a medical journal, but the team hopes to eventually share their research findings so that jurisdictions can assess the options that will enable their health-care workers to be appropriately protected.

What’s more, on Saturday, Manitoba’s chief nursing officer said housekeeping staff at the province’s acute care centres will start collecting used N-95 masks for re-use if they’re are deemed safe.

Lanette Siragusa says the province has been in touch with vendors to be ready for possible supply interruptions of protective equipment, but has also started gathering “ gently used” N-95 respirators from all its acute care sites for sterilization.

However, she said soiled, wet, damp and stained N-95 masks will continue to be discarded.

“Millions” of masks from China

On Saturday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that “millions” of masks would be delivered on a chartered cargo flight from China “within 48 hours.”

Ottawa is expecting the plane to deliver between seven and eight million surgical masks.

According to Trudeau, Canada has also leased a warehouse in China so additional supplies can be collected and distributed “as quickly as possible.”

But, while Canada continues to receive goods from international suppliers, Trudeau said the country is also depending on PPE from domestic manufacturers.

Canada’s deputy chief public health officer, Dr. Howard Njoo said on Sunday that Canada is looking to increase its domestic capacity.

“That won’t happen overnight,” he said, “But certainly efforts are underway to make sure that here in Canada that we have the capacity down the road — hopefully sooner rather than later — to make our own personal protective equipment.”

Njoo said currently an “allocation framework” is in place with “lots of factors in play” that help determine where supplies are sent.

“For example, if a given part of the country has a specific outbreak or region that’s particularly affected, certainly that would be a priority to get the masks that are available to that specific area,” he explained.

Asked by reporters if Canada is looking into other measures for healthcare workers, including providing a place to stay if they become ill and need to self-isolate, Tam said nothing is off the table.

“We are looking at everything to slow the spread of the virus and this epidemic, and so these are some of the kinds of discussions that we do have with provinces and territories,” she said.

She said in Manitoba, officials are already considering these types of supports to protect frontline workers and their families.

“So absolutely, that’s one aspect of our response that we can offer support for should that be needed,” Tam said.

Rabat – Osang Healthcare, a South Korean manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies, is set to provide 100,000 COVID-19 test kits to Morocco.

The Moroccan government secured the deal with Osang on March 26.

The kits include in vitro diagnostic tests, which use samples taken from the human body such as blood. The kits comply with WHO Guidelines and are certified to be sold in Europe.

The kits detect the virus through DNA testing, providing a fast and easily accessible way to identify the clusters of infection promptly, as a result contributing to containing the spreading of COVID-19. Early testing is an efficient method for preventing the spread of viral diseases.

The contract agrees on priority supplies of 100,000 kits for Moroccan people. Osang Healthcare has added extra 10,000 kits free of charge as a goodwill donation.

The kits will reach Morocco via a special flight that will also return Korean citizens from Africa, decided in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Moroccan ministry is also helping to negotiate the supply of kits for other African governments.

An official from Osang Healthcare has described the direct visit of the Moroccan Ambassador to South Korea and the “quickly concluded contract” as reasons for Osang Healthcare to provide Morocco with 10,000 diagnostic kits free of charge “on a humanitarian basis.”

As of March 29, Morocco has confirmed 450 cases of COVID-19, including 26 deaths and 12 recoveries.

Since the start of the outbreak, Morocco has carried out 2,125 tests for suspected cases of COVID-19, out of which 1,665 have texted negative.

More than 2,300 people suspected of contamination in the country are currently under daily monitoring, while close to 700 have finished the 14-day monitoring period without showing any signs of the virus.","['2,125 tests']",,,

It will spend the money on 1,000 more intensive care beds, 550 ventilators and 100,000 testing kits, as well as medicine and other equipment, the ministry added.

The government has put 1 billion dirhams into a special fund for its coronavirus response, which has been topped up with private donations.

The same fund will also finance stipends ranging from 800 dirhams ($80) to 1,200 dirhams to every head of a household operating in the informal sector whose activity was impacted by the lockdown to contain the virus, the finance ministry said.",,['550 ventilators'],,

Morocco took a package of special measures to cushion the economic and social impact of the pandemic.

Morocco has decreed a state of health emergency, locked its borders and instituted general confinement since March 20, and had mobilized to support the populations most affected by the slowdown in economic activity.

In this connection, Morocco set up, at the initiative of the King, a special fund for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic that has so far raised over $3.2 billion.

The fund, destined among others to upgrade health equipment and infrastructure, has disbursed $200 million to buy ventilators, intensive care beds and laboratory equipment.

According to the Finance Ministry, the amount was destined to buy 1000 intensive care beds, 550 ventilators, 100,000 testing kits, 100,000 collection kits, imaging and scanning devices, pharmaceutical products and other equipment key to treating coronavirus cases.

The fund will also assist the MSMEs impacted by the lockdown through the suspension of the payment of social charges, the deferral of bank loans etc…, and more importantly the employees affiliated to the National Pension Fund, CNSS, notably through the disbursement of specific allowances.

The informal sector employees, who represent a large part of the population and who have lost their income due to confinement, will also be allowed compensations over the three coming months ranging from $80 to $120 according to the family size.

Morocco is also stepping up efforts to increase the number of hospital beds and intensive care unit beds to increase the country’s capacity to accommodate coronavirus patients. The government announced recently that it intends to increase the number of intensive care beds to 3000.

Meanwhile, several industrial units have adapted their production activities to meet needs of local and national markets in medical gears in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the civil society is very active providing assistance to the needy and the elderly.

Several international media have hailed the precautionary measures taken by Morocco, the latest being the Forbes France Magazine which underlined this Monday April 6 that “taken together, these measures constitute a veritable Marshall Plan deployed by the King of Morocco, who from the start of the crisis applied the principle of maximum precaution in order to preserve the Kingdom from the pandemic.”",,['550 ventilators'],,

On 23 March, Saudi Arabia helped airlift WHO medical equipment and supplies from WHO’s logistics hub in Dubai to Aden, Yemen. The shipment, which included personal protective items for health workers, laboratory screening tests, trauma medication and other medical supplies, will be distributed to Sana’a and Aden to support readiness for COVID-19, as well as the humanitarian response to the ongoing conflict. Earlier on 9 March, Saudi Arabia delivered a shipment of medical equipment to Wuhan city in China.

In response to an urgent WHO appeal, Saudi Arabia is also donating US$ 10 million to support all countries of the Region in their national COVID-19 response to combat the spread of the disease. An additional US$ 10 million is in the process of being donated to provide WHO Yemen with essential equipment and supplies as part of Yemen’s national readiness and response plan.

“Infectious diseases such as COVID-19 know no borders. We have seen how a public health threat in one country can quickly affected entire regions and spread to become a global pandemic. This funding will help WHO intensify its efforts as it takes regional and global action to combat the spread of the disease,” says Dr Ahmed Al Mandhari, WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean.

With cases of COVID-19 also reported within Saudi Arabia, the country’s Ministry of Health is scaling up surveillance and testing measures. All suspected cases are investigated, particularly at points of entry, and confirmed cases are immediately isolated and treated. The Ministry has designated 25 hospitals, amounting to 80 000 hospital beds and 8000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, for the treatment of COVID-19 cases. 2200 beds have been designated for the isolation of suspected/quarantined cases.

Based on its experience with other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, in early January Saudi Arabia developed country-specific guidelines based on WHO guidelines to deal with the new virus. The country is also drawing from its unique expertise in managing mass gatherings and emergency preparedness during the annual hajj pilgrimage.

To stop the spread of COVID-19, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Health is reaching out to the press and the public through all possible outlets, especially on social media. The country has also produced ‘Your Ultimate Guide to COVID19’ to give citizens and residents access to COVID-19 facts and precautionary messages in 12 languages. Actions to engage the public in prevention and control activities, and to combat rumors and false information about the disease, have been significantly scaled up.

“As the world holds its breath, WHO and its member states are working with all possible speed to prevent the spread of this disease, especially to countries where health systems are frail. We acknowledge the efforts of Saudi Arabia in the prevention and control of COVID-19 by adopting a “Whole of Government” approach as recommended by WHO for their national response to COVID19. Saudi Arabia has taken all precautionary measures including preparedness, detecting, testing, tracing and isolation.

Here's a roundup of developments in RFE/RL's broadcast countries.

Russia

Authorities in Moscow will impose on March 30 tighter restrictions on residents in an attempt to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said.

Residents of the Russian capital will only be allowed to go out to buy food or medicines at their nearest shop, get urgent medical treatment, walk the dog, or take out the trash.

Those needing to go to work will also be allowed to leave their homes, and authorities will introduce a system of passes in the coming days.

""Gradually but steadily, we will keep tightening control as needed in this situation,"" Sobyanin said on his website on March 29.

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia has exceeded 1,500, with 270 new cases in the past 24 hours, health authorities reported.

Eight fatalities have been recorded so far, Russia's anti-coronavirus crisis center said on March 29.

Most of the news cases -- 197 -- were reported in Moscow, which accounts for more than 1,000 infections, according to Sobyanin.

Earlier on March 29, Sobyanin said the “situation with the coronavirus spread has entered a new phase. More than 1,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded in Moscow.""

Russian health officials have warned that a sharp increase in the number of cases in the country is expected in the coming days due to expanded testing in Moscow.

Authorities in Moscow also closed shopping centers, restaurants, and larger parks from March 28 for at least a week. Moscow authorities have encouraged people to stay home, and begun restricting public transit.

Meanwhile, the Russian government has announced it will “temporarily” close the borders starting on March 30 to curb the spread of the outbreak.

The measure will not apply to Russian diplomats and the drivers of freight trucks, among others, the government said on March 28.

Earlier, the Kremlin said that a member of President Vladimir Putin's administration has been infected with the coronavirus, but the person had not been in direct contact with Russia's leader.

On March 25, Putin postponed next month's referendum on sweeping constitutional changes that could allow him to remain in power until 2036 because of concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.

Putin also called for the week between March 28 to April 5 to be a nonworking week -- essentially a weeklong holiday for the country to ""prevent the threat of the quick spread of the illness.""

The government also ordered all vacation and health resorts closed until June.

Other restrictions ordered by the government included the cancelation of all international flights.

Uzbekistan

Less than 15 days after Uzbekistan detected its first coronavirus infection, the government in Tashkent reported 11 new cases on March 29, bringing the nationwide total to 144.



""Another 11 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the country, the total number of infections is 144,"" the press service of the Health Ministry said in a statement.



The Central Asian country reported its first case of the respiratory illness on March 15 and on the same day authorities imposed a quarantine in all preschools and educational facilities and canceled all mass gatherings.



Outdoor markets, commercial stores, and eateries were also shuttered.



Uzbekistan, a country of 32 million people, has since March 24 been closed off for entry and exit for all modes of transportation.



Interregional transportation connections were suspended on March 27.



An order is in place for the wearing of protective masks in all public areas.

Iran

Iranian authorities said they have extended the temporary releases of thousands of prisoners in an attempt to curb the spread of the new coronavirus in the country’s overcrowded jails.

Authorities said they would also temporarily free another 15,000 prisoners, bringing the total number released to 100,000.

Iran is one of the countries worst hit by the virus, with a declared death toll of 2,640 as of March 29, although experts estimate the total to be much higher.

Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told state TV on March 29 that the release of 15,000 more inmates on temporary releases ""had already started.""

He said all 100,000 prisoners would be temporarily released until April 19.

On March 17, Iran said it had freed about 85,000 people from jail temporarily, including political prisoners.

Iran said it had 189,500 people in prison, according to a report submitted by the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran to the Human Rights Council in January.

In recent days there have been several prison riots and mass escapes from prisons, as inmates try to avoid the coronavirus amid substandard prison conditions.

Meanwhile, President Hassan Rohani said ""the new way of life"" in Iran was likely to be prolonged by the coronavirus outbreak.

Rohani told a cabinet meeting on March 29, ""We must prepare to live with this virus until a treatment or vaccine is discovered, which has not yet happened to date.""

""The new way of life we have adopted"" is to everyone's benefit, he said, adding that ""these changes will likely have to stay in place for some time.""

Tehran on March 25 decided to ban all intercity travel until at least April 8.

Without an official lockdown in place, the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay home ""as much as possible.""

Schools and universities in some provinces were closed in late February and the closure was later extended to the whole country.

The reopening of schools following this year's Persian New Year holidays of March 19 to April 3 appears unlikely after Rohani's warning.

Iran has refused the United States' offer of humanitarian assistance, saying that Washington should lift sanctions if it wants to help Tehran fight the epidemic.

Iran has been under crippling U.S. sanctions in connection with its nuclear and missile program.

Kazakhstan

Kazakhstan has locked down its fifth major city as part of measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus and will tap into its emergency fund to help alleviate the economic effects of the outbreak, authorities said on March 29.

Karaganda and several of its satellite towns were added to the list after seven cases of the disease were diagnosed in the city on March 29.

The Central Asian nation has confirmed 265 coronavirus cases and has already locked down its capital, Nur-Sultan, its biggest city, Almaty, as well as Shymkent, a large city in the south, and Aktau, a Caspian Sea port.

Among the satellites under lockdown is Temirtau, home to Kazakhstan's biggest steel mill owned by steel giant Arcelor Mittal.

Energy-rich Kazakhstan will tap its $60 billion National Fund for an additional 1.825 trillion tenge ($4.1 billion) this year, Information Minister Dauren Abayev said on March 29.

The money will help finance Kazakhstan's $10 billion stimulus package aimed at softening the blow from the coronavirus outbreak and the plunge in the price of oil, the Central Asian nation's main export.

Armenia

Armenia has reported two more deaths of patients who had been infected by the coronavirus, raising the Caucasus nation’s total to three fatalities.

Armenia's Health Ministry on March 29 said the total number of confirmed cases has reached 424.

On March 28, in a Facebook post, Health Minister Arsen Torosian wrote: “I regret to inform you that two deaths have occurred in [Yerevan’s] Nork infectious diseases hospital during the past hour.”

“The victims are a 55-year-old woman and a 73-year-old man who had the new coronavirus in combination with other chronic diseases,” he added.

On March 26, Armenia reported its first fatality among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 -- a 72-year-old woman who Armenia’s health authorities said had suffered from multiple medical conditions, including heart disease.

According to official data, 30 patients with COVID-19 have recovered in Armenia.

A state of emergency was declared on March 16, set to run until at least April 14.

On March 25, to further slow the spread of the highly contagious and potentially deadly virus, Armenia’s government introduced a one-week self-isolation regime throughout the country, restricting the movement of citizens.

Under the order, citizens can leave their homes only for permitted work and for a number of vital reasons, such as the purchase of food and medicine, or to exercise.

Torosian, the health minister, said on March 28 that he did not exclude that the self-isolation period could be extended beyond April 1.

Ukraine

Ukraine's Health Ministry on March 29 said that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases reached 475, including 10 deaths.

Five people have recovered, Deputy Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer Viktor Lyashko told journalists on March 29.

Ukraine’s parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, has scheduled an extraordinary session for the afternoon of March 30 to adopt legislation that would protect the Eastern European country during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Meanwhile, a second transport of medical equipment arrived in Kyiv from China on March 29.

The plane carrying 300,000 respirators, 35,000 protection suits, and 1.8 million surgical masks landed at Boryspil airport, said Kirill Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.

Romania

Romania on March 29 reported 308 more confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus and two more deaths, bringing the total number of infections to 1,760 and the fatalities to 40.

Romania's crisis group dealing with the outbreak said one of the two victims was a 27-year-old woman who was suffering from diabetes -- the youngest victim so far -- and the other was a 71-year-old man. Both fatalities were from northeastern Romania, where most cases have been identified.

As of March 29, a total of 21,460 Romanians have been tested.

Some 8,666 people are in quarantine, and 132,641 are in isolation at home under medical supervision.

A total of 12 Romanians died from the coronavirus abroad, eight of them in Italy. An estimated 4 million Romanians work in Italy and Spain, two of the world's worst-affected countries.

Romania declared a state of emergency on March 16 over the pandemic and went into a ""total quarantine"" on March 25, with army troops deployed to help enforce the order.

Pakistan

Pakistani authorities said that 121 more coronavirus cases were recorded in the country over the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 1,526 cases, including 13 deaths.

Health Minister Zafar Mirza said on March 29 that 71 percent of coronavirus cases in Pakistan were imported, mainly pilgrims who returned from neighboring Iran, which has seen the Mideast's worst outbreak.

Cases in Pakistan have been gradually increasing despite the imposition of a lockdown in the country of 220 million.

Lawmakers and experts have voiced fears of an exponential increase in the coming days and urged the government to conduct more testing.

“The data coming in of patients across the country is not indicative of the true picture. The real number of patients is much higher,” Attaur Rehman, the head of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s task force on science and technology, told reporters.

The Health Ministry said that there were 13,324 suspected cases of the new coronavirus. More than 8,000 were in quarantine across the country.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is ramping up coronavirus tests in preparation for the ""worst scenario"", as it grapples with Southeast Asia's highest number of infections, a health ministry official told Reuters.

The World Health Organisation has urged countries to widen testing to contain the virus. Malaysia's tally of infections has jumped six-fold in just ten days to more than 1,500, exceeded only by China, South Korea and Japan in Asia.

By the end of the week, Malaysia will double daily testing capacity to 7,000, before stepping that up to 16,500 by the first week of April, the official, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said.

""We are preparing for the worst scenario, but hope for the best outcomes,"" Noor Hisham, the director general of Malaysia's health ministry, added in a text message late on Monday.

""Once we have the capacity ready, we will scale up active case detection, testing, isolation and treatment.""

Ministry data shows Malaysia had done 17,923 tests by Monday, when the biggest daily increase of 212 new infections took the country's total to 1,518.

That works out to about 560 tests per million people, fewer than neighboring Singapore's 4,500 tests per million, according to the city-state's most recent data, but well above Indonesia's single-digit figures.

Malaysia has recorded at least 14 virus deaths.

It has linked nearly two-thirds of its infections to a religious gathering last month near the capital, Kuala Lumpur, that the government says drew more than 16,000 people. The event is also linked to more than 100 cases across Southeast Asia.

On Monday, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Malaysia may extend beyond the end of the month travel and movement curbs imposed to contain the spread of the virus. [nL4N2BG1XK]

The number of infections in Malaysia has doubled in a week to 2,161, the highest total in Southeast Asia. Many are linked to a religious gathering at a mosque that was attended by 16,000 people.

Malaysia is testing rapid antigen test kits from South Korea that show if someone has COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, Health Ministry Director General Noor Hisham Abdullah said.

“If the accuracy is high, we may place 1 million order,” Noor Hisham said at a news conference. “Hopefully the decision will be reached tonight.”

Rapid test kits could help determine if somebody has the virus faster than diagnostic tests that draw on a nasal swab to confirm active infection.

Noor Hisham said Malaysia’s diagnostic testing capacity has been increased to 7,100 cases per day. Earlier this week, he said the capacity would be increased to 16,500 by the first week of April as it braces for the “worst scenario”.

Malaysia has done a total of 30,948 tests as of noon on Friday, ministry data showed.

More than 1,000 cases of confirmed infections in Malaysia are linked to the mosque gathering. The ministry has said it has seen five generation of infections from the event participants.

Malaysia currently has in place travel and movement curbs to contain the spread of the virus.

Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced a stimulus package worth 250 billion ringgit ($58 billion) to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic.","['30,948 tests']",,,

The Transport Minister said 100 beds were ordered from Pukang Medical Equipment, the largest medical equipment manufacturer in Hebei, China.

He said the task of bringing in 100 ICU beds was not easy and three planes had to be deployed to transport the beds – each weighing 250kg – back home.

“As the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) had barred entry of foreigners into the country, the Transport Ministry had to specially appeal to CAAC to allow Teleport – the logistics and cargo arm of AirAsia – to fly to Tianjin and Beijing to transport the 100 beds back to Malaysia in stages.

“In the end, CAAC allowed AirAsia’s Airbus A330 to fly to Tianjin to transport 28 ICU beds, as the size of such beds are too big and reached the maximum capacity of the planes, ” he said in a Facebook post on Monday (April 6).

The Ayer Hitam MP said the government is waiting for the green light from CAAC to for another AirAsia flight to transport the remaining 72 ICU beds as soon as possible.

He added that many countries such as Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States are also importing beds from China.

He also thanked Yayasan Petronas for their generous donation in contributing 100 electric ICU beds to the Health Ministry to treat Covid-19 patients.

“The ICU beds are a great help to save the lives of the patients who need it.

“Thank you to Yayasan Petronas, Teleport, AirAsia Kargo, the Chinese Embassy in Malaysia and Wisma Putra who facilitated the transport of the ICU beds, ” he said.",,,"['28 ICU beds', '100 ICU beds', '72 ICU beds']",

While the COVID-19 pandemic has reached nearly every corner of the globe, one country stands out, for now, as unmarked by the virus. Wrecked by five years of brutal war, Yemen is already home to the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. There are currently no reported cases in the country, which is very fortunate: The coronavirus’s spread in the country would be particularly catastrophic.

Despite that potential disaster scenario, the Trump administration announced on Friday that it is cutting $70 million worth of aid to northern Yemen, where the country’s humanitarian crisis is the most acute. International organizations say this funding could have gone to health programs that Yemenis desperately need. The country’s medical facilities have been routinely attacked during the war between the country’s Saudi-backed government and Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. According to Yemeni government statistics, there are only 700 ICU beds and 500 ventilators in the country for a population of about 30 million.

“It’s a very big problem as the U.S. was one of the biggest donors,” says Caroline Seguin, Doctors Without Borders deputy program manager for the Middle East. For example, in northern Yemen, there is now no funding to open a COVID-19 treatment center, she said: “If you don’t have any money to pay doctors’ salaries, it will be very difficult to open any center that treats the coronavirus.”

The official reason for the U.S. cutting is that the Houthis, who control northern Yemen, have been siphoning off food supplies and other aid intended for the Yemeni populace. The move also fits into a strategy employed by the Saudi coalition in its war against the Houthis: limiting the rebels’ resources in order to pressure them into political concessions. Yemeni civilians have suffered as a result, but despite the outcry from human rights groups, the U.S. and U.K. have continued to provide military and logistical support to the Saudi coalition.

Meanwhile, fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi coalition has kicked up a notch over the past few days despite United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres’ recent call for a global cease-fire so the world can work together to fight COVID-19. The Houthis fired two ballistic missiles at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, over the weekend. Saudi Arabia responded by bombing the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which the Houthis control. The pattern of fighting is consistent with Houthi-Saudi sparring over the past few years as negotiations consistently break down between the two warring sides. While these most recent attacks may only be posturing before the two sides begin negotiations yet again, less promising for a cease-fire is the increase in deadly fighting between the Houthis and Saudi-supported government forces along the border of Houthi territory in Yemen, eastward of the capital.

“The truth is that even if the fighting were to stop, a COVID-19 outbreak would be catastrophic for millions of very poor, very hungry, and vulnerable people in Yemen, but if it does not stop, it will be far worse,” said Peter Salisbury, Yemen senior analyst at International Crisis Group.

Additionally, it’s unclear if the country’s beleaguered health system would be able to keep track of COVID-19 even if it had arrived. COVID-19 isn’t the only health crisis Yemen faces. In 2017, the country went through the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with about 1.2 million cases, and Yemen often seems to be on the brink of a resurgence, while also fighting outbreaks of dengue fever and typhoid.

“It would be very lucky to have no cases in Yemen, for sure,” said Seguin.

According to the World Health Organization, it has distributed about 1,000 COVID-19 testing kits to medical facilities across Yemen. So far, only suspected cases who have symptoms and a history of exposure are being tested. “It’s nowhere nearly enough where you could test every suspected case that walks into a hospital,” said Christine Cool, WHO spokesperson in Yemen. Because Yemen hasn’t announced any cases yet, it’s not considered a priority country for receiving more coronavirus-related supplies from WHO.

Still, at the time of a pandemic, Yemen’s isolation may have turned into a strange blessing. Even before COVID-19, Yemen was relatively cut off. Houthi-controlled Yemen received no commercial air travel, and Sanaa’s airport had only been functioning for the past few months. While the Saudi blockade on Houthi territory has led to humanitarian catastrophe, it may have had the unintended consequences of helping keep the coronavirus at bay. Now the Houthis are enforcing a quarantine for any Yemeni entering their territory from government-controlled Yemen, even if the person is just returning home. The conditions of the quarantine are reportedly grim.

Even in the rest of the country, nominally under control of Yemen’s internationally recognized government, there were few international commercial flights a day from neighboring countries on the national carrier, Yemenia, and only into two cities, Aden and Seiyoun. These flights were suspended in mid-March, though it is certainly possible that Yemenis traveling home from Cairo, for example, could have brought COVID-19 into the country. In preparation for the virus’s arrival, Yemen’s government has tried to take steps to enforce social distancing by suspending gatherings for Friday prayers and closing markets that sell qat, the mild narcotic that is widely consumed in Yemen, though local reports show that these efforts have not always been obeyed.

There is one part of Yemen, however, that did receive international travelers prior to the flight suspension: the island Socotra, south of the mainland in the Indian Ocean. Over the past few months, a few dozen tourists, mostly from Europe, have been flying from Cairo to the island each week. So far, there have been no known cases of COVID-19 in Socotra, but given that medical care is quite limited on the far-removed island of 60,000, it could swiftly turn into a coronavirus nightmare if there are cases. There also are no testing kits on Socotra, according to WHO. Swabs would have to be sent to Aden.

I was one of those visitors in early February. I recall being required to complete a medical form upon arrival, attesting that I hadn’t visited China recently. Little did Socotra authorities know that it would have been wiser to ask if I had come from Europe.",,['500 ventilators'],['700 ICU beds'],

Save the Children warns","COVID-19: in Gaza, Syria and Yemen fewer than 730 ventilators and 950 intensive care beds for over 15 million children and their families. The fight against coronavirus, therefore, becomes unsustainable

Less than 730 fans and 950 intensive care beds for over 15 million children and their families in the areas most difficult to reach by humanitarian organizations in Yemen, northern Syria and Gaza to fight eventual infection by COVID-19.

This is the alarm launched today by Save the Children, the international organization that for over 100 years has been struggling to save children at risk in areas where the health care is poor and guarantee them a future. the lack of health facilities in these areas makes them highly unprepared to respond to the spread of COVID-19. The lack of ventilators and intensive care beds is an issue, too.

Coronavirus in areas of crisis

Gaza has been under blockade for 13 years, Syria has just entered its tenth year of conflict – with strong tensions continuing to occur in the north of the country – and Yemen is in its sixth year of the war, says Save the Children.

In all three areas, health systems have been severely compromised, and in some cases are now collapsing, and have medical resources that are already unable to respond to current needs and would therefore not be able to face a global pandemic. Intensive care units do not have enough beds to host possible infected people.

In Syria, at the moment, 9 COVID-19 cases and one death are confirmed, 9 cases of positivity also in Gaza, while Yemen has not yet declared any of them. But there is much tension.

Beds in the intensive care units

In north-west Syria, the Organization explains, there are a total of 153 fans and 148 intensive care beds, compared to almost one million displaced people living in overcrowded areas and a population of 3 million people, including 1.5 million children.

Likewise, there are fewer than 30 ICU places in northeastern Syria, only ten adult ventilators and one pediatric ventilator, for a population of 1.3 million people, half of whom are children. There are no tampons available across the country.

In Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a high percentage of the population living in refugee camps with limited access to water and other basic services, only 70 beds are available for 2 million people in intensive care and 62 fans.

A worrying scenario that also concerns Yemen, where only half of the hospitals are still fully functional and where 700 intensive care beds are available, including 60 for children, and 500 fans, all for a population of over 30 million people, of which over 12 million are children.

SARS-CoV-2 and humanitarian organizations

The support of humanitarian organizations to people in need is essential to slow down the spread of COVID-19 in this critical phase, but the possibility of reaching children and their families is often hampered by conflicts, movement restrictions and other problems.

Preventive measures such as social distancing and hand washing are very complicated if not impossible in overcrowded areas such as Gaza and refugee camps in northern Syria.

Furthermore, water sources are often not safe and daily water shortages can occur. In Gaza, for example, 96 per cent of the available water is not clean and many times undrinkable for human consumption.

“What I’m most afraid of is that there are so many people in Gaza and we don’t have the means to deal with the virus,” Rafaat *, 13, told Save the Children.

“Because of this pandemic, we have to stay home and our family is unable to earn anything,” added 11-year-old Jood *.

“I have heard of COVID-19. My family members say it is very dangerous and that if it arrives in Yemen we cannot survive. My mother walks to the well every day for 15 minutes to fill the water container and then takes another 15 minutes to go back.

The water is not clean, but it is the closest source for us. We use it for cooking, drinking and washing. We try to use it as little as possible, so as not to go out again to pick it up, ”said Moneer * of Taiz, Yemen.

“In places where medical care is scarce, prevention is essential. However, measures such as social distancing are extremely difficult in conflict countries.

In Gaza, for the Palestinians to be able to respect the distance of two meters from each other, the territory should be ten times larger than it currently is; Syrian families living in IDP camps should expand into other tents that are not there, while in Yemen, where about 2 million children suffer from acute malnutrition, the priority is to get food, “said Jeremy Stoner, Regional Director of Save the Children in the Middle East.

“Many children in Gaza, Syria and Yemen already have worrying health conditions due to a childhood consumed by the war. They risk suffering from malnutrition, being injured or not being vaccinated. The same goes for their parents, many of whom have little or no family support and cannot even afford to get sick. It is literally a matter of life and death to ensure the support needed in these areas for a COVID-19 outbreak to be contained, “added Stoner.

Save the Children calls on the government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the de facto authorities of Gaza to assume their international responsibilities and guarantee the right to health for children in Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem. Restrictions on the entry of humanitarian and medical aid to Gaza must be lifted and people in need of medical care must have access to it.

The organization also calls on the parties to the conflict in Syria to observe a complete ceasefire in the northwest, in order to guarantee unhindered humanitarian access to reach people in need. Similarly, even in Yemen, all warring parties must fully implement the recently announced ceasefire to help the country prepare for a possible COVID-19 outbreak.

Due to the closure of international borders, blocking flights and new restrictions on movement, Save the Children is already facing a slowdown in its humanitarian response. In this context, field operators must, therefore, be able to reach people in need with existing humanitarian aid and distribute hygiene products, telephone cards, economic aid without hindrance and conduct awareness-raising sessions for prevention.

Save the Children is strongly committed in Syria, Yemen and Gaza so that projects for children can be carried out. The safety of children, communities and our staff is a top priority and for this, we take all measures to deal with the epidemic. Like other international organizations, we are working on emergency plans to ensure that our work can continue in the area and we are preparing to respond to the needs of children affected by the pandemic.

The Houthini rebels opposed to the U.S and Saudi backed government in Yemen have interfered with aid assistance, making it difficult for the US Agency for International Development to know if the aid is being used for legitimate purposes. The decision comes after the U.S has declared a national state of emergency due to COVID-19, which has infected more than 200,000 known U.S citizens.

Yemen, a country stuck in one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, has yet to report any cases of the virus. They are seriously underprepared. If COVID-19 reaches Yemen as aid is cut, it would be a catastrophe for the entire population. Lacking supplies and medical staff, Yemen will likely see people dying at a quicker rate than equipped countries, such as the U.S and Italy who are struggling to keep the curve flattened themselves.

A spokesperson for USAID has said, “This decision is a last resort. The United States, other donors and international aid organizations have been advocating with the Houthis for years to allow aid groups to operate independently, but we have now reached a point where continued obstruction has made it impossible to ensure aid is reaching those who need it most.” Trump is cutting 70 million in humanitarian aid to the region, leaving about 12 million for lifesaving emergencies.

According to slate news, Yemen officials have said they have “700 ICU beds and 500 ventilators to equip a country with a population of about 30 million.” Democrats have highly advised against this current measure until after the crisis, as Yemen is already having trouble delivering basic needs to its citizens. 80% of Yemenis depend on international assistance. An outbreak, which the WHO has warned about in the Middle East, will be fatal and deadly to the Yemen population without essential aid to boost healthcare systems.

According to Al-Monitor, Yemen only has 500 tests. More than half the population is malnourished and most hospitals are not accessible due to bombings and the Saudi-blockade. COVID-19 has been a disaster situation in some of the most prepared western countries. If it reaches a country such as Yemen, it will escalate to a point where millions will die.

Democrats are pushing for a war powers lawsuit against Trump to end the long supported Saudi led coalition under the Trump regime in Yemen. This would make support of this war unconstitutional and US participation would eventually end. The UN recently issued a ceasefire in Yemen, demanding that the war be put on halt during the current crisis, but Houthini rebels seem unfazed. However, as the situation progresses so may international peace. The corona virus has put many disputes at a halt to combat the disease, and it may change the way the world looks at humanitarian crises forever.

The Houthinis, Iranian lead rebels, have been attempting to overthrow the Saudi-lead government that the U.S has backed. Many anti-war efforts have worked towards bringing this to an end and opening up communication between the two rivals to create negotiations between both sides to end the conflict. However, Trump has taken a very hands-off approach, which has only evolved the escalation of the war as Iranians are getting stronger in the region. Now, they have successfully grown strong enough to block aid. The U.S diplomats need to cease fighting and start making treaties using soft power approaches, as cuts to aid will only merely halt some attacks during this time but could end up killing a huge portion of the population. Iranian forces will persist and potentially create new terrorist threats emerging in the region. Diplomacy is needed now more than ever. Before this proves to be a full-blown crisis once corona virus hits the region. Negotiating now will bring a long-awaited end to the war, which is something that many officials warned should have been dealt with months ago.

In maintaining international peace with many unstable countries, it is important to create an environment that brings both sides together without neglecting huge populations of people. Thirty million Yemini’s are depending on assistance and healthcare if an outbreak happens. Unless diplomacy is created before an outbreak ravages the population, then we will be unable to stop rebel forces from blockading basic health care facilities and taking supplies.

Peace is the most important aspect of this situation, yet the virus seems to be escalating tension. While the US is seeing an overload in its own healthcare system, this should be a wakeup call for governments to push for peace in the future, as we have seen the devastating impacts worldwide from avoiding long-term issues that could have been solved years ago through diplomacy.

It is clear now international governments should stop holding off diplomacy and find peaceful solutions to the crisis in Yemen. Best before it is too late to stop an outbreak.

Yemen,,https://reliefweb.int/report/yemen/more-15-million-children-and-their-families-yemen-syria-and-gaza-set-face-covid-19,"More than 15 million children and their families in Yemen, Syria and Gaza set to face COVID-19 with fewer than 1,700 ventilators and beds - Yemen","Save the Children calls for an easing of restrictions on aid for hard to reach areas

Fewer than 730 ventilators and 950 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds are available for more than 15 million children and their families in areas that are hard for aid agencies to reach in Yemen, northern Syria and Gaza - meaning they are critically underequipped to respond to an outbreak of COVID-19, Save the Children is warning.

The Gaza Strip has been under blockade for 13 years, Syria has just entered its tenth year of conflict - with the Northern front currently the most active - and Yemen is in its sixth year of war. Healthcare systems across all three areas have been decimated, in some cases to the point of paralysis, and have minimal do not have nearly enough medical resources to respond to ongoing needs, let alone a global pandemic. As of March 29, Syria had confirmed 9 COVID-19 cases and one death, Gaza 9 cases, and Yemen is yet to declare any.

In North West Syria, there are a total of 153 ventilators and 148 beds in ICU, while nearly a million recently displaced people are living in overcrowded areas. In North East Syria, there are fewer than 30 ICU beds, only ten adult ventilators and just one paediatric ventilator.

In Gaza, there are 70 ICU beds and 62 ventilators for 2 million people. It is also one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a high proportion of the population living in refugee camps with limited access to water and other basic services.

In Yemen, where only half of the hospitals are still fully functional, there are 700 ICU beds, including 60 for children, and 500 ventilators.

The continued support of humanitarian organisations to people in need is vital to slow the spread of coronavirus in this critical phase, but access to children and their families is often hampered by conflict, movement restrictions and other challenges. Preventive measures such as social distancing and hand washing are difficult if not impossible in overcrowded areas like Gaza and displacement camps in Northern Syria. Water sources are unreliable across all three locations, and shortages can occur daily. In Gaza, 96 percent of the available water is unsuitable for human consumption.

Children in Gaza told Save the Children about their fear. Raafat*, 13, said: ‘What I’m most afraid of is that Gaza is highly populated and doesn’t have enough resources to face the virus.’ Jood, 11, said: ‘This pandemic affects us, because we have to stay home and there is no income for the family.’

In Yemen, Moneer*, 17, from Taiz said: ‘I have heard about Corona. People in my family said that it was very dangerous and we wouldn’t survive it if it came to Yemen. Every day, my mother walks for 15 minutes to the well to fill the container with water and then walks back for another 15 minutes. The water doesn’t look clean, but it is the nearest source for us. We use it for cooking, drinking, and washing. We try to use as little as possible so we don’t have to go fetch it again.’

Jeremy Stoner, Save the Children's Regional Director, said: ‘In places where medical care is scarcely available, prevention is critical. Yet measures like social distancing are hugely challenging in countries in conflict. If people need to stay two metres apart, for Palestinians living in Gaza to comply with this, the territory would have to be ten times larger than it currently is; for Syrians living in displacement camps, families would need to spread out in numerous tents currently unavailable; and for Yemenis, of whom about 2 million children suffer from acute malnutrition, the priority would be getting food.'

Many children in Gaza, Syria, and Yemen suffer from pre-existing health concerns caused by childhoods consumed with war. They will be malnourished, injured, or will not have been properly vaccinated. The same is true for their parents, many of whom have little or no family support and cannot afford to become ill. It is literally a matter of life and death to support these areas in their efforts to contain a COVID-19 outbreak,’ he added.

Save the Children is calling on the Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the de-facto authorities in Gaza to uphold their international responsibilities by ensuring the right to health is fully provided to children in the West Bank including Jerusalem, and Gaza. Restrictions on humanitarian and medical relief items entering Gaza must be lifted, and people in need of medical care must be afforded access to it.

We are also calling on warring parties in Syria to observe a complete ceasefire in the North West to allow for the full and unhindered access to people in need. In Yemen, all warring parties must fully and truly implement the recently announced ceasefire to help the country prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak. As an aid agency, Save the Children is already facing a slowdown in its response because of closure of international borders, grounding of flights, and new limitations to movements in country. Teams on the ground need to be able to reach people in need with existing humanitarian aid, and distribute for example hygiene products, awareness sessions, sim cards, and cash without any impediments.

China rescues Ghana in coronavirus fight

play videoThe delegation which received the donation at the Kotoka International Airport

Ghana has received some over 30,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs), from the People’s Republic of China.



This forms part of efforts to help some 17 West African countries including Ghana help deal with the situation of Coronavirus in their countries.



The medical supplies, totalling 38,800 include 3,000 N95 protective face masks for frontline health workers, 10,000 protective face masks for all, 2,500 disposable overalls, 800 Infra-red Thermometers, 2,500 medical goggles, 10,000 single-use gloves and 10,000 disposable shoe covers.



Health Minister, Kwaku Agyemang Manu, speaking at the arriving ceremony in Accra, expressed gratitude to the People’s Republic of China, emphasizing how much of help and relief it will serve the country in the interim, whilst government puts in measures to produce its very own locally manufactured PPEs.



“We are very grateful to the People’s Republic of China. As we sit here, I can only say that the systems for health in West Africa are very very fragile. We haven’t positioned ourselves strong enough to do what China did and we’ll definitely need some support. We never had source for emergency response when the problem started but Government has done a lot to put in protective equipment especially for our health workers working in the frontline.” He said



Adding, “As we move ahead, it is becoming more clear that we may need, all of us, to begin to wear some of these things, so this gesture is not something we can underscore as Ghana makes efforts to add all”



He further noted that some 5 local companies have been selected and will soon begin work to produce and manufacture several of these PPEs for use in the country.



“We are continuing to develop some of these equipment, for protection in-country and soon you’ll see government efforts also coming. By the end of the week, about 5 selected companies will start sewing some of these overalls, protective masks and all that we need we will be able to provide in our country.”







The Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, H.E. Shi Ting Wang on his part reiterated China's commitment to helping other countries and continents including West Africa, battle the disease considering China has seen a significant drop in figures and casualties as far as the pandemic is concerned.



""Many Chinese companies are also doing their best to support Ghana and other African countries. The Chinese government, for its part, will further strengthen medical cooperation with African countries in a bid to contain this pandemic...As a truthful friend of Africa, we will spare no effort in our support to African countries."" he said.



Foreign Minister, Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey and China's Ambassador to Ghana,

H.E. Shi Ting Wang, among others were present at the Arriving Ceremony of Chinese Aid to 18 African Countries for the Fight Against COVID-19.

In view of that, he announced that his government was placing priority on the procurement of PPEs for them, comprising of 350,000 masks, 558,650 examination gloves, 1000 reusable goggles.20, 000 cover-alls, 7,000 N-95 respirators and 500 waterproof gumboots among others.

President Nana Addo said that he was encouraged by the numerous responses from local manufacturers from the private sector of Ghana to domestically produce face mask, head covers, surgical scrubs and gowns, which would commence on Tuesday. He added that 3.6 million would be produced locally with estimated daily output of 150,000.

Other measures the president announced were 50% salary allowance for frontline health workers, free three months water bill to be enjoyed by all consumers and to be absorbed by government from April to June, soft loans scheme for small and medium enterprises and constant supply of power and water throughout the period.

KATHMANDU, Nepal—Officially, there have been only five coronavirus cases in Nepal. But despite the tiny numbers, the country entered full lockdown on March 24 for at least a week—a decision the government made after finding only the second case, a Nepali student arriving home from France via Qatar. Flights and long-distance buses have been suspended, and the country’s borders are sealed—even to its own citizens.

Originally, Nepal treated the outbreak as a distant threat. The local jokes around the supposed immunity of Nepalis to the virus even caught on with government officials, who declared the country a “coronavirus-free zone” to boost the Visit Nepal 2020 tourism campaign.

As the coronavirus has spread worldwide, however, the mood in Nepal has become increasingly serious. The border closure is aimed in part at Nepali workers abroad—who are now stuck in foreign countries with little aid from their governments.

So far, most citizens appear to be observing the lockdown—in part because the police have been strict enforcers, including delivering beatings. In a country where most people live on less than $1,000 a year, and which is highly dependent on tourism, the economic impact is likely to be brutal—but no measures have yet been announced. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday morning for heart issues and has not yet announced any financial measures since his discharge on Friday.

Sher Bahadur Pun of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital told Foreign Policy: “The government has prepared, but no country is really perfect to deal with this virus at this time. We need to actively trace and contain the virus so that we can prepare for the worst scenario.” Pun added that he was hopeful that conditions in Nepal might mean people had stronger immune systems and that frequent hand-washing was a cultural norm.

Initially, there were many false theories and pieces of fake news around the virus—such as the idea that Nepalis might somehow be immune to the virus or that China’s air pollution and poor hygiene were the main culprits, sparing a people who pride themselves on cleanliness.

Like many nations, Nepal was also lethargic in testing. According to the Ministry of Health and Population, Nepal has tested just 802 people so far—with 799 negative results, one person in recovery, and three4 in isolation. The Health Emergency Operation Center reported on Thursday that 17 people were in isolation as a precaution and that 44 new cases were detected but they were found negative. The ministry has also designated 25 hospitals across the country to deal with the virus and rolled out more than $200,000 for the purchase of medical equipment.

The World Health Organization (WHO) examined Nepal’s only testing facility, the National Public Health Laboratory in Kathmandu, and made a statement that the center was capable of accurately testing the virus. WHO, however, recommended that the center repair and upgrade its facilities. According to Bikash Devkota, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health and Population, the laboratory has the ability to conduct 4,000 tests in a week, but a lack of swab kits and extensive guidelines for swab testing have limited the daily test to 50 only.

Testing is likely to ramp up, as the government on Saturday sent a flight to Guangzhou, China, to bring back medical equipment (including swab kits) that it purchased. On March 22, the Jack Ma Foundation announced that it would donate medical supplies to Nepal, and medical supplies provided by China are arriving via the Tatopani border in the north.

Despite the low numbers, Nepal’s poverty and lack of doctors could prove catastrophic—though its demographics may be an advantage. Hospitals lack personal protective equipment (PPE), ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and intensive care units, which has made medical staff wary of treating patients. The hospitals are frantically searching for new staff due to a lack of health workers.

Sameer Dixit of the Center for Molecular Dynamics told Foreign Policy: “If we face a situation like in Italy, Spain, and the United States, then we cannot handle it. But fortunately, we have a young population, and the most at-risk group makes up only 10 percent of people. So the government needs to focus on protecting the old and vulnerable groups. Only 4 percent of people are over 60.”

The social entrepreneur Mahabir Pun has started to produce PPE from his National Innovation Center, which focuses on the promotion of research and development in Nepal, but medical staff worry the gear may not be up to standards—and say there isn’t nearly enough.

Swornim Gyawali, a doctor at a private hospital in Kathmandu, said: “Our hospital has provided PPE to medical workers but not up to standard. Front-line workers are worried about getting infected, as happened in China and Italy. But there’s a lack of coordination and equipment from the government and the system, which scares us.”

The lack of medical preparation has created an exodus of Nepalis, many of whom have residence or citizenship elsewhere and who fled abroad in large numbers while it was still possible. Fear of total brain drain was another prompt for the flight ban announced on March 20, due to last until at least March 31.

Nepal’s huge southern neighbor, India, has posted only small coronavirus numbers so far, but experts fear spread there will grow fast. China, however, may become a source of aid in a country the two Asian powers have often fought for influence over.

Nepal is expected to extend the lockdown to two more weeks and probably announce an economic relief package. With luck, Nepal might escape the worst of the coronavirus itself—but it can’t shake off the damage done by a crashing world.","['4,000 tests']",,,

Compared to other South Asian countries, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in the Himalayan nation Nepal has been relatively modest to date. The first instance of the virus was reported in the country on January 24, and the second case in the third week of March. Soon after the second case was reported, the Nepal government enacted a week-long lockdown across the country. Kathmandu is operating under the reality that if the virus spreads, Nepal may not be equipped to handle it. The first lockdown expired on March 30 and has been extended.

As the number of coronavirus cases gradually increases, it’s clear the government has made some mistakes. When the virus was spreading rapidly in other countries, Nepal did not impose travel restrictions. Meanwhile, visitors to Nepal did not all strictly follow government requests that they self-quarantine for 14 days and the government did little to follow up with travelers to ensure compliance. A ban on international flights was only imposed in the third week of March and subsequently the border with India was closed.

If case numbers swell, observers say it would be very difficult for Nepal to fight the coronavirus alone due to its limited resources and fragile healthcare system. The Nepali healthcare system is not fully prepared to deal with a large-scale pandemic that is straining healthcare systems even in developed countries.

Local governments in Nepal, which have a key role in contact tracing and treatment, are facing a serious resource crunch and have been slow to act.

Nepal only recently adopted a federal system. The previous centralized structures have crumbled, but new effective mechanisms are not all in place. There is a lack of coordination among the three tiers of government: federal, provincial, and local. According to Dr. Sushil Nath Pyakurel, former director general of the Department of Health Services under the Ministry of Health and Population, there was a robust chain of command from center to the grassroots, which was broken after the country adopted the federal structure two years ago.

“First, the federal government has failed to properly manage human resources. The adjustment of civil servants has not been completed even in over three years; there is either over- or under-staffing. Second, management of logistics and infrastructure has been faulty. Third, there is lack of effective coordination and information sharing-system among three-tier of government,” he said.

There are not sufficient resources and manpower for the massive testing and treatment of people that may be needed. Testing facilities are concentrated in Kathmandu valley, with a capacity to test just 30-40 people in a single day. To date, only about a thousand people have been tested. That said, the government has started to set up testing labs in other regions of the country. Still, there is a lack of sufficient manpower and logistics for testing. There is not a specific agency to deal with the pandemic, such as the Centers for Disease Control that exist in some countries, nor has Nepal done any long-term planning to deal with a pandemic.

When last time Nepal faced a serious crisis — the earthquake of 2015 — the international community rushed to offer support. But with this crisis, the powerful and well-resourced countries that had previously assisted Nepal in its hour of need are themselves facing the same crisis. They are not in the same position to offer assistance. Nevertheless, some countries — such as the United States and Germany — have announced monetary assistance to Nepal to fight the coronavirus. However, Nepal desperately needs further support for basic needs such as testing kits, personal protective equipments (PPE), and other medicines.

Donations from China’s Sichuan province and the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu include different kinds of masks, thermometers, chloroquine phosphate tablets, protective clothing, and portable ventilators weighing 1.1 tons, according to Chinese media. Similarly, donations from the Alibaba Foundation and Jack Ma Foundation include 100,200 N95 masks and 20,064 test kits weighing 1.4 tons, according to media. The Nepal government has also purchased relevant goods from China.

India, so far, has not announced any medical assistance but media reports say that Delhi is ready to send a rapid response team to Nepal. According to The Hindu, “Army medical teams and two Indian Navy ships were on standby to provide required assistance to friendly countries in the neighborhood.” In 2015, after the earthquake, India was the first country to send rescue teams followed by China, the United States, and others. In this crisis, India is not in a position to send largescale medical logistics and equipment because of its own domestic needs.

In the past, big countries used to compete in providing assistance to Nepal; this crisis is different in that all countries are facing their own domestic troubles too. For example, in 2015 India and China competed with each other to announce ever bigger assistance packages. To date, the United States has announced it would provide $1.8 million to fight the coronavirus in Nepal. Earlier, the United States provided some personal protective equipment. Germany has announced that it is enhancing its existing health program in Nepal with an extra 1 million euro grant to respond to emergency situations related to COVID-19.

Due to an open border, there is a need for strong collaboration between Nepal and India to fight the coronavirus. Approximately 1 million Nepali migrant workers are in India. Due to the the 21-day lockdown enacted by the Indian government, Nepali migrant workers are returning to Nepal and hundreds are stranded along the border area. The Nepal government has decided to allow them to return with the condition that they live in quarantine for 14 days. However, some of those who returned in the past are violating the isolation directive. Due to the open border, it is very difficult to restrict the movement of people.

Similarly, Nepal is heavily dependent on India for essential supplies, including medicines. If lockdown in India results in the interruption of supply chains, Nepal will obviously face difficulties.

Regional organizations such as the South Asian Association for Regional Coordination (SAARC) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) are arguably in a position to coordinate and provide support to member countries. But both organizations are now almost obsolete.

On March 15, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with SAARC members proposing a common strategy to fight the coronavirus. In the same meeting, Modi proposed the establishment of a fund to help support countries in their fight with the virus, but the move has not progressed far enough. Other countries have announced that they would contribute to the SAARC fund, but Pakistan held back. Lately, Pakistan has proposed to keep the COVID-19 emergency find under the SAARC Secretary General, but other member countries have not reacted to the proposal. Sar far, BIMSTEC has not taken any measures to collectively fight the coronavirus.

Small developing countries like Nepal, hamstrung by resource constrains and fragile healthcare systems, cannot fight the coronavirus alone. Bigger, wealthier, and more developed countries, despite their own constraints, and regional organizations are in a position to lend support to smaller countries.

Stuck between two emerging powers, China and India, Nepal finds itself in a tight spot geopolitically. The existing powers perceive the Himalayan country as having a difficult choice to make between China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the United States’ Indo-Pacific Strategy. Although Nepal already made a statement by signing a BRI agreement with China on May 12, 2017, the controversy surrounding U.S. engagement in Nepal persists. The issue here is that the great powers continue to make moves based on hackneyed interpretations of the Himalayan nation’s interests.

Since the signing of BRI, Nepal and China’s relationship has only grown stronger, while its southern neighbor India is trying to mend its 2015 mistakes — such as the imposition of an economic blockade after Delhi disapproved of Nepal’s promulgated constitution. Why does India’s relationship with Nepal matter for the success or failure of the Indo-Pacific Strategy? This is simply because the United States has handed the baton of overseeing the South Asian region to India for a long period of time now – and to make this clearer U.S. President Donald J. Trump approved this in his recent India visit. This move to use India to manage other South Asian countries, however, hasn’t gone well for the struggling superpower.

In a recent article, Alyssa Ayres of the Council of Foreign Relations says that “The Indo-Pacific framework inherently places India at the heart.” On the other hand, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal and the incumbent U.S. ambassador to Nepal have continuously put forward the rhetoric that the United States doesn’t see Nepal from the eyes of India. American officials in Washington D.C. and those visiting Nepal have given a completely different version of this, stating that the Indo-Pacific is the United States’ strategy to deal with Nepal. These divergent statements not only confuse policymakers and critics within Nepal, but also pit the Indian administration against the United States. Unlike Ayres, who argues for trusting India more, I argue that the United States needs to deal with Nepal on a face-to-face basis if it desires to keep China at bay. However, with the emergence of the BRI and Nepal’s tilt toward China, this is unlikely.

Nepal is a young federal democracy and although its government is now stable, it is a communist one. The United States has a slight advantage over China to reap fruit from it, simply because Nepal still adheres to a democratic state structure. This was evident in the recent call by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to reignite the slumbering South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on March 25. At that meeting, Modi proposed a $10 million fund and a number of other initiatives to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Nepali Prime Minister K.P. Oli, meanwhile, pledged $1 million on March 20 during his live telecast address to the nation. This sudden cooperation is lauded by many, with the hope that perhaps SAARC will come to life again.

Meanwhile, with China bringing the coronavirus outbreak under control, it has now reached out to Nepal, India, and other as many as 10 other Eurasian and South Asian countries as of March 20 to help out these nations in their respective fight against the virus. Nepal has already provided a list of items it needs to China on their request. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba Group, also tweeted on March 21 that they are providing 1.8 million masks, 210,000 test kits, 36,000 protective suits, plus ventilators and thermometers to Nepal, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. All these developments only suggest that China is in no mood to lose to the United States.

But the United States was ahead of both India and China in helping out Nepal. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Nepal government on March 6 and also assisted the Nepal Army on February 18, with seven sets of medical personal protection equipment, 400 sets of latex gloves, and 110 biohazard bags to evacuate Nepali students from Wuhan city, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. The United States also pledged $1.8 million in assistance to Nepal on March 19 for its fight against the virus. In this sense, the geopolitical picture is clear.

Despite the United States playing a key role in assisting Nepal’s democratic institutions to flourish through various assistance programs, geopolitics and geopolitical distance come to make a difference. Like in the past, the U.S. administration continues to tackle Nepal through the lens of India – which, in itself, is problematic to Nepali policymakers, analysts, and even the Nepali people. The outcome of the coronavirus outbreak and the help of India, China, and the United States toward Nepal will manifest in its future and in how the country responds to the geopolitical competition as the global economy is hit and a landlocked nation like Nepal largely depends on India and China. A temporarily closed border on the south will, of course, prove an advantage to China, and a disappointment for India.","['210,000 test kits']",,,

Colombia — like many other countries in the region — has shut down all nonessential businesses and declared a 19-day quarantine that runs through April 13.

The decision to sacrifice the economy in order to save lives has hit everyone in the nation of 50 million. But for those already living on the edge, the results have been devastating. And few groups live closer to that edge than the 1.8 million Venezuelan migrants residing in Colombia.

Beli Fonseca, 20, said she now spends her day trying to keep her 2-year-old son entertained and hoping neighbors will bring them food. The one day she tried to work on the street she was run off by police enforcing the quarantine.

More than 4.9 million Venezuelans have left their country in recent years, as the once wealthy South American nation is mired in a political, economic and social crisis without precedent in the region.

The coronavirus is not only depriving migrants of making an income but has also shuttered many of the institutions they relied on.

In the Colombian border city of Cúcuta, David Cañas, a Catholic priest, was providing free meals to about 5,000 Venezuelans a day. But he had to close the operation, called Divina Pastora, on March 13, when the government issued orders to enforce social distancing.

“First they said no gatherings larger than 500 people, then they said no gatherings larger than 50 people, and now they say no gatherings,” Cañas said from his home in Cúcuta where, like everyone else in the country, he’s been on lockdown.

The border town is usually buzzing with Venezuelan migrants washing windshields or selling trinkets on the corner. Now it’s dead.

“This is a ghost town,” Cañas said. “If they catch you on the street, you have to pay a fine, so Venezuelans have no one to sell to, no one to provide services to. They’re just going hungry.

“Even if you wanted to rob someone, you couldn’t; there’s no one to rob,” he said.

Colombia has been one of the most generous nations in the region amid the Venezuelan crisis. It has offered temporary work permits to more than 415,000 Venezuelans and given them access to already strained emergency medical services.

But the pandemic is testing the limits of the region’s largesse.

While Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and others are rolling out financial aid programs to help their most vulnerable citizens amid the lockdown, those benefits don’t extend to migrants, who are often undocumented.

When Colombia announced its quarantine, thousands of informal workers, many of them Venezuelans, protested in the capital.

“We’re worried that migrants are going to become invisible in this crisis,” said Juan Viloria, the coordinator for Coalición por Venezuela, an association of groups that work on behalf of the Venezuelan diaspora. “Countries are taking care of their own, which is understandable. But Venezuela, which should be taking care of its citizens inside and outside of the country, is not doing it, because the regime is more worried about staying in power than saving people’s lives. ... That’s why so many of us have had to leave.”

His organization has delivered about 6,000 pounds of produce to Venezuelan migrants stranded in Barranquilla in three days, but the demand is far greater, he said.

Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro is ruling over an economy in shambles. The nation is highly reliant on oil sales to stay afloat, but a combination of crashing crude prices, widespread corruption and U.S. sanctions have gutted the economy. While human rights organizations are asking Washington to lift sanctions during the pandemic, the Trump administration is doubling down, indicting Maduro and some of his closest allies last week on drug trafficking and terrorism charges — further complicating the government’s ability to get outside financing.

By all accounts, Venezuela is woefully unprepared to handle the pandemic. Its hospitals often struggle to keep water running and the electricity on. By some counts the entire country of 32 million has fewer than 90 ICU beds. When the United Nations launched a $2 billion COVID-19 appeal last week, it singled out Venezuela, Haiti and Venezuela’s more than 4 million refugees and migrants being hosted by Latin America and Caribbean nations as being in most desperate need of help.

Carrie Fipiletti, the deputy assistant secretary for Cuba and Venezuela in the U.S. State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Venezuela’s shortcomings will likely have a regional impact.

“If Venezuela is not able to address the challenges it faces with controlling COVID-19, then going into the future [we’ll see it] going into Brazil and Colombia and the surrounding region,” she said during a conference hosted by the Americas Society/Council of the Americas. “Just as we have seen with the refugee crisis, we will too see an expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

As of Wednesday, Venezuela had reported 135 cases of the coronavirus and three deaths, but health experts say the actual number is likely much higher. Colombia, by comparison, has reported 798 cases and 14 deaths.

Daphne Panayotatos, an advocate and program coordinator with Refugees International, a nonprofit, said that the pandemic threatens to shove refugee and migration issues into the background, even as those populations are some of the most vulnerable.

A report issued by the group this week found that migrants like Beli Fonseca often live in cramped conditions with little access to healthcare, basic sanitation and the information they need to stay safe.

“Viruses don’t recognize borders, they don’t discriminate between migrants, refugees and citizens,” Panayotatos said. “We are only as strong as the least healthy person of our society.”

In that sense, caring for migrants “is not just morally right, it’s the smart thing to do,” she said.

While Colombia has declared a moratorium on evictions during the health emergency, that’s not being respected. Viloria said his organization is tracking at least 50 Venezuelan families who have been thrown out of their homes for not paying rent.

Beli Fonseca said she’s trying to stay calm and wait for the quarantine to lift so she can get back to work. Despite the depth of her hardships, she has no intention of returning to Venezuela.

“They are even worse off there than we are here,” she said. “Even when you can find food there is no way to make enough money to buy it. ... Things were ugly there when I left, and that was before the coronavirus.”",,,['90 ICU beds'],
Venezuela,04-07-2020 02:08,https://theunionjournal.com/venezuela-faces-two-viruses-international/,Venezuela faces two viruses,"The effort to confront the Covid-19 crisis in Venezuela is inseparable from the fight against the dictatorship. They are not, as the regime tries to promote, areas that can be solved separately. Nor could one hand over financial or other resources to a dictator who steals everything in his path: a power that has demonstrated its criminal nature.

It is not possible to face the pandemic without facing the dictator. And this, in essence, because the absolute responsibility for the Venezuelan debacle lies with Nicolás Maduro. At this time, when contagion is spreading across the country, the dictatorship and the pandemic constitute for Democrats a single and simultaneous objective.

Both health systems, public services and the oil industry have been destroyed and looted by the regime. The country, which due to its population should have at least 100,000 hospital beds, does not reach 15,000. In other words, the capacity is today well below the minimum necessary 20%. Even more alarming, is the data on the availability of ICUs with mechanical respirators: only 84 in the public sector and 120 in the private sector. Just 200 units to respond to a disease that attacks the functioning of the lungs and if it were to affect half the population as estimated in most countries, at least 150,000 intensive care services will be required.

The narco-dictatorship has turned the pandemic into its human shield

The complaints and testimonies of doctors, paramedics, unions and hospital users are unanimous: the Venezuelan hospital system is in ruins. Many do not have water -read well: hospitals without water-, the most basic and essential resource for health action and the basic input for the basic recommendation: washing hands. In most of them, electric service failures are recurring – read correctly: hospitals without electricity. All, absolutely all, lack the basic minimum supplies to care for patients and to protect health professionals. There are no gowns, caps, gloves, masks, supplies of alcohol, soap and other items to avoid the rapid spread of infections. There are no medications – read it well: hospitals without medications. There are no disinfectants. The only resource they have is the will of health workers, who right now are wondering how they will save the lives of the sick, when most have difficulty reaching their health center due to lack of fuel. that has paralyzed the country in recent days. It has been the policies spearheaded by Maduro that have created this hecatomb.

The concern that prompts me to write this article does not stem solely from the catastrophe of the public health system. At the center of our anguish is the growth of precariousness, the most marked deterioration in the living conditions of the vast majority of Venezuelans. We have the Democrats of Venezuela and the world, who press the alarm button, when we read that less than 7% of the population has constant drinking water, and that almost 18% never receive it. We must press the alarm button when we read that less than 10% receive constant electrical service. We must raise our voices in all scenarios, to say that only 6% of the population has guaranteed access to the food necessary to live. It is necessary to do the unspeakable to attract the attention of the world, to warn that, right now, less than 1% have access to fuel. I repeat: the sole responsibility for the almost non-existence of public services and fuel lies with the dictator.

We must act without delay to prevent the disease from sweeping the country

I must add that, in our country, 87% of families do not have the money to allow them to stay at home without going out on the streets in search of sustenance. Not a day. They do not have food in their cupboards, nor disinfectants, nor soap, nor water – I insist on it. At least two thirds have a biological age that does not correspond to the actual time of life: their bodies have aged, due to hunger, diseases and the conditions in which they live. A malnourished body is a fertile field for the virus.

The first wave of Covid-19, which had its epicenter in the Asian region, taught the precious role that information plays as a barrier to disease. The second wave, in full swing in Europe, has tested the response capabilities of governments and health systems. This is its main lessons. The third wave, of which Venezuela is part, has its main foci in Latin America and Africa, where the spread of the virus could exceed the worst forecasts. A third wave that is just beginning and that the WHO has recommended to developing countries to “prepare for the worst”.

What actions has the Nicolás Maduro dictatorship taken to respond to the action of Covid-19? First, make jokes and minimize danger and create a false expectation of control. Then lie: affirm, with arrogance, that the Government has all the necessary resources. Then, take advantage of the situation, to ask your reviled International Monetary Fund for $ 5 billion. Subsequently, militarizing the country and turning the sale of fuel into a -another- gigantic network of corruption and political controls, and most seriously, the repression has intensified, imprisoning doctors and journalists who have dared to speak out, thus like many members of President Guaidó’s close team, whose persecution has become more intense during the pandemic. No one can be misled: the narco-dictatorship has turned the coronavirus into its human shield, into its tool, into the excuse it needed to prolong the usurpation, increasing social control and repression.

An emergency government may enable the necessary resources

Maduro has fused with the virus. They are the same entity, to which it is not possible to grant a truce. It must be fought in all areas, without rest. We have a responsibility to act without delay to prevent the pandemic from devastating Venezuela. The Interim Government, under the leadership of President Juan Guaidó, has proposed a route for the solution:

1. Form a National Emergency Government with representation from all sectors of the country. In order for it to be in line with our Constitution and to fully reintegrate into the international community, it cannot be conducted by defendants with charges of drug trafficking or terrorism, or by human rights violators.

2. To delegate to the Council of State the executive powers to attend the emergency, until the holding of free presidential elections.

3. Once the Emergency Government is established, the sanctions will be gradually lifted.

4. Strengthen the presence and capacity for action of international humanitarian and human rights agencies in Venezuelan territory.

5. To approve a Law of Guarantees that generates the mechanisms to guarantee national stability and the care and reparation of victims.

6. Execute a national emergency plan with international humanitarian and financial support that allows hospitals to be provided with medical supplies, humanitarian food aid, direct subsidies for the most vulnerable population, import of gasoline and gas to supply the country, and facilitate access to water, among other priorities.

7. Hold free elections in a period not exceeding 6 to 12 months, essential to resolve the political crisis and resume the constitutional and democratic thread of Venezuela.

This proposal is inclusive, enjoys broad support from the international community, and is aimed at all sectors, both the democratic sectors and those who make life within the Venezuelan State, particularly in the military sphere, and even those who, being from the circle close to the dictator and realizing that he is lost, decide to avoid further trauma to our people in exchange for some benefits that international justice has agreed to give.

The proposal has received prompt support from the United States and from countries in Europe and Latin America, which now total 47 countries. That emergency Government will be able to enable, very quickly, the necessary financial resources and the help of international agencies for the enormous task that would have to be addressed.

But, I must insist on this, it is a single fight: against that unique and murderous entity that makes up the dictatorship and the pandemic.

Leopoldo López, Venezuelan politician, imprisoned in 2014, since April 2019 has been protected at the Spanish Embassy in Caracas. He is the coordinator of the Juan Guaidó Government Center.

Venezuela,03-24-2020 00:00,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/venezuela-coronavirus.html,"Opinion | Whenever I Throw Away a Mask, I Think of Venezuela and I Freak Out","What will happen in a country like Venezuela, where hospitals have already collapsed, and institutions treat people as a latent threat that must be monitored and dominated at all times? Just in February, there were an average of 26 protests a day, largely fueled by a lack of basic services such as water.

On Sunday, President Nicolás Maduro announced that there were 77 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country, and claimed the infected were all “imported” from other countries like Spain, the United States, Italy and Colombia. He also declared that 135 people had been tested and that “two million more tests” would be carried out this week.

But it’s unlikely that a country in the throes of a deep economic crisis, with 3.7 million undernourished people and a health care system that’s been practically incapacitated by decades of poor management and corruption, would be able to manage the coronavirus. “These are the conditions for a perfect storm,” Dr. José Félix Oletta, a former minister of health, said earlier this month. “We could have a huge problem.”

The virus will ravage an already devastated system. Hospitals can’t serve the current population even under normal conditions. They are overcrowded, dirty and lack basic equipment and medicines. When I was doing my residency in Mérida, I often had to bring my own bottles of water in order to be able to wash my hands or face during shifts. Finding a working, clean bathroom was a challenge. In 2019, at least 50 percent of I.C.U.s reported significant shortages of medicine and supplies.

Just two weeks ago, 70 percent of hospitals didn’t have the tests to diagnose Covid-19. And there are only two centers authorized to carry out the diagnosis of the virus using molecular tests. One is at the National Institute of Hygiene in the capital of Caracas, and the other is the University of the Andes in Mérida, where I studied, which has the capacity to perform 20 tests a day. Testing kits, provided by China, will be transported to these centers alone — increasing the time required to obtain results and making the monitoring of the infection more difficult in a country of around 26 million people. (Since 2016, nearly six million Venezuelans have left the country because of its economic collapse and political instability.)",['20 tests'],,,

Why that claim is hard to believe,"If the country is to be believed, North Korea is one of maybe a dozen nations not yet invaded by a deadly virus that has spread across the globe from remote islands in the South Pacific to outposts nestled high in the Pyrenees or the Greater Himalayas.

North Korea’s assertion would mean that despite sharing a nearly 900-mile border with China, one tens of thousands have crossed to escape or navigated as part of a robust smuggling trade, the isolated nation has managed to block a mercurial virus that has upended richer and more powerful countries.

The U.S., its longtime existential foe, has more than a quarter of a million confirmed cases of the coronavirus. China, its erstwhile backer and most important trading partner, has more than 80,000.

North Korea’s official coronavirus count is zero.

The tightly controlled country has boasted to its people that international organizations and public health experts were marveling at its success in keeping the virus at bay. As recently as this week, a state health official rebuffed suspicions that the country was being less than forthcoming about its coronavirus situation, telling foreign reporters in Pyongyang that not a single person had come down with COVID-19 thus far.

The lack of free media and scant independent monitoring make it nearly impossible to vet the official account. Yet many outside observers and officials have questioned the country’s claim, alleging the regime of Kim Jong Un may be suppressing information or willfully blind to potential local outbreaks because it lacks the capacity to conduct widespread diagnostic testing.

With a poorly equipped medical system ravaged by sanctions in recent years, the country has struggled with a population susceptible to infection, widespread malnutrition and inadequate sanitation. An outbreak of the coronavirus may be an impending disaster, former North Korean health professionals and outside experts say.

“You can’t trust North Korean statistics,” said Choi Jung-hun, who worked for a decade as a physician in North Korea before escaping in 2011. “The epidemic really plainly shows the nature of the North Korean regime. ... The regime’s face saving is more important than citizens’ health or life.”

In fact, North Korea was one of the first countries in the world to take swift action as the coronavirus began spreading in China. It closed its borders to foreign tourists in January, around the same time China imposed travel restrictions in Wuhan. It imposed strict, lengthy quarantines on foreign diplomats and canceled virtually all international flights. More than 10,000 of its citizens were placed under isolation or travel restrictions as measures against the virus.

Nagi Shafik, a public health advisor and a former project manager for the World Health Organization in North Korea, said the early drastic steps indicated how cognizant the government was of the threat that an epidemic could pose to its stability.

“They don’t have medicine,” he said. “They don’t have reagents to diagnose cases. They don’t have protective equipment. If I were them, I would do the same thing, this is the only thing I have. To close borders with China, this is the lifeline for them. It shows you how desperate they were.”

But as much as North Korea’s authoritarian system is able to impose severe restrictions on its citizens’ movements, the virus is likely to make it into the country at some point if it hasn’t already, he said.

“Sooner or later something will spill over,” said Shafik, who last visited the country in 2019 to consult on a humanitarian mission. “Whatever you try, everywhere in the world, some people go through the borders without being noticed.”

Choi, the North Korean doctor who now works as a research professor at South Korea’s Korea University, said even though North Korea was plagued with infectious diseases, its capacity to conduct laboratory tests to diagnose them was minimal during his years of working there. When an illness began spreading in the country’s northern region around 2006, officials mistook it for scarlet fever for more than two months before finding out that it was, in fact, measles, he recalled.

In the absence of testing, patients would die from symptoms matching an infectious disease without doctors ever getting confirmation of what the person was sick with, according to Choi. Many patients simply turned to antibiotics across the board, creating drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis or typhus, he said.

“It’s not like there’s proper treatment even if people are diagnosed,” Choi said. “The basic infrastructure like electricity and water isn’t a guarantee even at medical clinics. Medical supplies and equipment are antiquated.”

In mid-February, North Korea quietly reached out to international organizations and nonprofits requesting assistance such as diagnostic test kits, protective gear and equipment, including ventilators and oxygenators. Russia in late February sent 1,500 coronavirus test kits to North Korea at its request, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.

Groups including Médecins Sans Frontières, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent and the World Health Organization obtained humanitarian exemptions from the U.N. committee overseeing sanctions to send in coronavirus-related relief supplies.

Since some of the outside supplies have arrived, the country has been conducting about 60 tests a day for the coronavirus, having completed about 1,000 as of this week, according to a person familiar with humanitarian efforts in North Korea who asked not to be named so as not to jeopardize their work in the country.

That’s a far cry from the widespread testing that’s being done in places like South Korea — which has tested more than 420,000 as of this week — to get a full picture on how the virus is spreading.

Even more dire than the virus’ potential impact might be the economic repercussions of sealing the border. Many North Koreans heavily rely on a network of unofficial markets, much of which is supplied by trade from China. For months before the coronavirus outbreak, many working on humanitarian assistance to North Korea had warned of food shortages in the country exacerbated by drought and international sanctions imposed in response to its weapons tests.

“This was a massive decision, with huge implications not just for the people but for the state economy,” said Kee B. Park, a consultant for the WHO and lecturer at Harvard Medical School who frequently travels to North Korea. “You might think it’s overreacting in a way, but they really understand the idea of breaking the transmission chain.”",['60 tests'],,,

April 7: Malawi records death, Infected mothers deliver in Cameroon, Uganda

Malawi’s coronavirus tally has reached eight with the Ministry of Health confirming the first casualty in the southern African nation.

The patient was a 51-year-old Malawian woman of Indian origin who had recently returned to the country from the UK. The ministry said she had an underlying heath condition.

Of the three new cases announced today, two of the patients are in the city of Blantyre and the other in Chikwawa town. Malawi was one of the African countries that recorded a case very late. So far only Comoros and Lesotho have yet to be infected.

Infected women deliver in Cameroon, Uganda

The BBC reports that a patient undergoing treatment for coronavirus in the Cameroon’s capital, Yaoundé, gave birth to a baby girl over the weekend, quoting a doctor at the hospital’s isolation ward.

The mother, 19-year-old Marie, gave birth normally but has since been separated from her newborn baby. The patient was connected to an oxygen supply when her contractions started, the report added.

“We just arranged the room and she delivered on her bed while on oxygen,” Dr Yaneu Ngaha Bondja Junie, a gynaecologist at the hospital, told the BBC.

The baby was born prematurely weighing 2.1kg (4.6lb) and is in the neonatal unit. It is not clear if the baby is infected as her tests are still being processed, but she is being fed with breast milk from her mother.

It is the second known birth of a child by a COVID-19 patient. Over the weekend, portals in Uganda confirmed the birth through Caesarean section of a healthy baby.

The Daily Monitor report gave the following details. The 22-year-old Ugandan mother gave birth to a healthy baby girl at Entebbe Grade B Hospital. She was reportedly infected by her husband who returned from Dubai recently.

“The patient gave birth very well this afternoon through a Caesarean Section and the mother and baby are in good health,” Dr Moses Muwonge, the director of the hospital is quoted to have said.

April 6 – 7: Ghana case spike, Sao Tome index case, cases pass 10,000

Cases in Ghana reached 287 as at Tuesday April 7, the health surveillance outfit reported in an update posted on its website. “Following measures for enhanced contact tracing and testing, Ghana has detected an increased number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.

“As at 6th April 2020, 23:30 hr, a total of 287 cases of COVID-19 with five (5) deaths have been recorded. The regional distribution of the cases are as follows: Greater Accra Region has most cases (258) followed by the Ashanti Region (18), Northern Region (10), Upper West Region (1), Eastern Region (1) and Upper East Region (1),” the update stated.

Ghana is West Africa’s third most impacted country by the development. The country is ranked behind Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast with 364 and 323 cases respectively.

Meanwhile, the continental tally has passed the 10,000 mark with close to 500 deaths and 1,000 deaths. South Africa is the continent’s most impacted with over 1,600 cases. Only two African countries are without cases – Lesotho and Comoros.

Meanwhile Sao Tome on Monday became the 52nd African country to record first cases of COVID-19. The Prime Minister confirmed that four persons had tested positive.

Sao Tome and Principe became the 52nd African country to record cases of the COVID-19. The island nation confirmed its first four cases on Monday, April 6.

Prime Minister Jorge Bom Jesus disclosed that the confirmation came after test results returned from Gabon. The development leaves Lesotho and Comoros as Africa’s virus free countries as of April 6.

The continent’s confirmed COVID-19 cases is heading towards 10,000, with over 400 deaths. Another 900+ patients have recovered.

Rwandan ministers and top officials have joined the growing trend of public officials donating their salaries to the fight against COVID-19. Cabinet ministers and others have agreed ti donate their April salaries to aid the countries fight against the pandemic

A statement from the prime minister’s office confirmed that other officials who agreed to forgo their salaries are leaders of national institutions and top government officials. The country has 105 confirmed cases with four recoveries. It is East Africa’s third most impacted behind Mauritius and Kenya.

A strictly enforced lockdown remains in place having been extended last week by the cabinet. The government has since last week been distributing food to citizens who had been relying on receiving pay every day.

Lawmakers in Nigeria weeks back agreed to forgo their salaries as contributions towards the COVID-19 fight. Kenya’s president and top government officials also took salary cuts for the same reason.

Over in Malawi, President Peter Mutharika also announced taking a 10% salary cut along with his ministers. “The coronavirus attack has a huge negative impact on the economy and businesses everywhere.

“There are many business people and industry players who are uncertain about the situation as it is unfolding. I know that everyone is worried,” he said.

“Therefore, government will take measures to protect jobs and incomes, protect businesses and ensure continuity of the supply chain and the survival of the economy.”

Amongst other measures, the president directed the Reserve Bank of Malawi to allow banks to offer a three-month moratorium on interest payments on loans to small- and medium-sized businesses.

He also ordered the country’s Competition and Fair Trading Commission to put in place strict monitoring of price controls and punish anyone found increasing prices at the expense of Malawians.

April 5: South Sudan index case

South Sudan has announced its first case of COVID-19, making it the 51st of Africa’s 54 countries to report the disease.

A U.N. worker who arrived in the country from Netherlands on Feb. 28 is ill with the disease, confirmed First Vice President Riek Machar and the U.N. mission in South Sudan. The patient, a 29-year-old woman, first showed signs of the disease on April 2 and is recovering, said officials.

South Sudan, with 11 million people, currently has four ventilators and wants to increase that number, said Machar, who emphasized that people should stay three to six feet apart from others. “The only vaccine is social distancing,” said Machar.

The patient is under quarantine at U.N. premises and health workers are tracing the people who had been in contact with her, said David Shearer, head of the U.N. operations in South Sudan. He said he hoped the measures would contain the case.

To prevent the spread of the virus in South Sudan, President Salva Kiir last week imposed a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for six weeks and closed borders, airports, schools, churches and mosques.

President Paul Kagame had in a national address late last week highlighted the resolve of government to do everything possible to support vulnerable Rwandans during the lockdown citing its social and economic challenges.

The hard-hit Rwandans living in urban centres without a salaried income are the most affected. The initiative kicked-off in some parts of the three districts of Kigali, state-run New Times said.

The food relief is being drawn from the country’s National Strategic Grain Reserve under the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources which is used in case of food shortage, the portal added.

March 27: Lesotho to lockdown on Saturday

Despite being among Africa’s virus-free nations, Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane, has announced a lockdown starting from Saturday, March 28, South African portal Eye Witness News reports.

The Mountain Kingdom landlocked by South Africa has not recorded any confirmed COVID-19 cases. It relies on South Africa to help with testing as it does not have the capacity to do so.

But on Friday, Ethiopian Airlines delivered coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits, masks, and protective suits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. The consignment arrived a day earlier than expected.

Lesotho’s ambassador to the African Union Mafa Sejanamane said delivery of the consignment was moved forward to ensure that it didn’t clash with South Africa’s national lockdown.

Meanwhile South Africa has revised the death toll of two to one after Health Minister Mkhize said one of the two persons announced earlier on Friday did not die of the virus.

The lockdown took effect with largely reports of obedience but also defiance in parts of the country leading security forces to make arrests and force others out of the streets. South Africa is Africa’s most impacted country with over 1,000 cases so far.

Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa also announced late Friday that the country will go into lockdown from Monday, March 30, in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus.

So far, the country has recorded five cases and one death, 30-year-old journalist Zororo Makamba. The low number of cases though “need not induce complacency”, Mr Mnangagwa said in an address to the nation.

For three weeks from Monday, Zimbabweans will be required to stay at home, except to buy food and access vital health services.

The southern African country is allowing the use of the US dollars again, reversing last year’s ban on foreign currencies – a move aimed at supporting the already struggling economy against the effects of coronavirus.

Africa could be underreporting figures

“You know as of today (March 18), the number of cases reported from sub-Saharan Africa are 233 cases and four deaths, that is actually in terms of confirmed cases, it is the lowest region.

“But as Mike said, we cannot take this number as the amount of, or the number of cases we have in Africa, probably we have undetected cases or unreported cases. But in addition to that, even if we take this 233 cases as true, we have to prepare for the worst.

“In other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point. So the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today. It is actually better if these numbers are really true, to cut it from the bud.

“And that is why we are saying we have to do the testing, we have to do the contact tracing, we have to do the isolation and cut it from the bud,” the words of Ethiopian Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.

He was speaking on Wednesday March 18 in the WHO’s daily press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic.

He stressed the need for mass gatherings to be avoided because of the propensity of aiding quick spread of the virus. “I think Africa should wake up, I think my continent should wake up,” he added.

President Paul Kagame had in a national address late last week highlighted the resolve of government to do everything possible to support vulnerable Rwandans during the lockdown citing its social and economic challenges.

The hard-hit Rwandans living in urban centres without a salaried income are the most affected. The initiative kicked-off in some parts of the three districts of Kigali, state-run New Times said.

The food relief is being drawn from the country’s National Strategic Grain Reserve under the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources which is used in case of food shortage, the portal added.

Over in Nigeria’s commercial hub of Lagos, the state government announced an Emergency Food Response as a means of supporting indigenes and the vulnerable. Neighbouring Ekiti State has announced a similar measures.

“We are all aware that this is a trying time for our citizens and since the partial drop in economic activities, our government deemed it necessary to reach out to the vulnerable ones in the society,” Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said.

For his part, Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, issued a new set of Executive Order with a raft of

orders which included reactivating the State’s food bank to support the vulnerable.

“I have directed that the Ekiti State Food Bank be reactivated immediately to provide food items to the poor and vulnerable families in our communities. The Task Force will announce the modalities as soon as the process is fully activated.

“The State Government will consider providing a stipend to our self-employed citizens whose daily income will be interrupted at this time as subsidy for their loss of income,” the order read in part.

March 27: Lesotho to lockdown on Saturday

Despite being among Africa’s virus-free nations, Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane, has announced a lockdown starting from Saturday, March 28, South African portal Eye Witness News reports.

The Mountain Kingdom landlocked by South Africa has not recorded any confirmed COVID-19 cases. It relies on South Africa to help with testing as it does not have the capacity to do so.

But on Friday, Ethiopian Airlines delivered coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits, masks, and protective suits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. The consignment arrived a day earlier than expected.

Lesotho’s ambassador to the African Union Mafa Sejanamane said delivery of the consignment was moved forward to ensure that it didn’t clash with South Africa’s national lockdown.

Meanwhile South Africa has revised the death toll of two to one after Health Minister Mkhize said one of the two persons announced earlier on Friday did not die of the virus.

The lockdown took effect with largely reports of obedience but also defiance in parts of the country leading security forces to make arrests and force others out of the streets. South Africa is Africa’s most impacted country with over 1,000 cases so far.

Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa also announced late Friday that the country will go into lockdown from Monday, March 30, in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus.

So far, the country has recorded five cases and one death, 30-year-old journalist Zororo Makamba. The low number of cases though “need not induce complacency”, Mr Mnangagwa said in an address to the nation.

For three weeks from Monday, Zimbabweans will be required to stay at home, except to buy food and access vital health services.

The southern African country is allowing the use of the US dollars again, reversing last year’s ban on foreign currencies – a move aimed at supporting the already struggling economy against the effects of coronavirus.

Libya, Guinea-Bissau and Mali record infections

Libya, the last country in North Africa has announced its first case of coronavirus. The Centre for Disease Control confirmed the case amid a continued battle between UN-backed government in Tripoli and the Benghazi rebel bloc led by Khalifa Haftar.

The country which has been in a state of conflict since 2011 has closed its borders according to orders by the rival governments.

Concerns have long been raised about the impact of the virus reaching the country whose health systems have been suffering in the amed conflict that has torn the country apart.

Over in West Africa, Mali confirmed its first cases of coronavirus – involving two citizens who returned from France on 12 and 16 March.

The patients are a 49-year-old woman from the capital Bamako and a 62-year-old man living in the western city of Kayes, the government said in a statement. The two are currently being treated as contact tracing efforts are carried out.

An AP report last week said the country’s under-resourced health system was one of the biggest headaches for authorities as cases continued to spread in the West African region. For now, only Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau are virus-free in West Africa.

Guinea-Bissau has registered its first two cases of coronavirus, Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam said on Wednesday.

The patients are a Congolese U.N. employee and an Indian citizen, and both have been placed in quarantine, he said, adding that public transport would be suspended to limit the spread of the virus.

Africa could be underreporting figures

“You know as of today (March 18), the number of cases reported from sub-Saharan Africa are 233 cases and four deaths, that is actually in terms of confirmed cases, it is the lowest region.

“But as Mike said, we cannot take this number as the amount of, or the number of cases we have in Africa, probably we have undetected cases or unreported cases. But in addition to that, even if we take this 233 cases as true, we have to prepare for the worst.

“In other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point. So the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today. It is actually better if these numbers are really true, to cut it from the bud.

“And that is why we are saying we have to do the testing, we have to do the contact tracing, we have to do the isolation and cut it from the bud,” the words of Ethiopian Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.

He was speaking on Wednesday March 18 in the WHO’s daily press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic.

He stressed the need for mass gatherings to be avoided because of the propensity of aiding quick spread of the virus. “I think Africa should wake up, I think my continent should wake up,” he added.

Sudan: The Sovereign Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency to help control the coronavirus pandemic. The country has only a case which has resulted in the death of the patient in question.

The council “decided to close all airports, land and sea border crossings, except to humanitarian aid,” spokesman Mohammad al-Fakki Suleiman told journalists. State news agency Suna quoted a military spokesman as saying that cadets and trainees would be given leave as a precaution.

Tunisia: The North African country announced it will be closing its land borders and airspace to all commercial activities from Wednesday, in a bid to protect the country from the spread of coronavirus.

Health officials say the number of confirmed cases has risen to 24. The latest announcement by Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh comes three days after a 16:00 curfew was announced for restaurants, cafes and bars.

All commercial flights are to be cancelled, but arranged evacuation flights will be permitted. Trade and cargo will not be affected by these measures.

Ivory Coast: The country via an announcement by President Alassane Ouattara on Monday evening announced a temporary ban on foreign visitors especially those from countries hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

The ban only applies to countries that have more than 100 confirmed cases, the authorities said in a statement on Monday. This includes the US, France, the UK and most of Europe.

For the next 15 days, only Ivorian nationals and permanent residents of the country will be permitted to enter from abroad following a mandatory two-week quarantine on arrival.

The security council headed by President Alassane Ouattara also ordered the closure of all schools and universities from Tuesday for a period of 30 days.

Chad: Despite being virus-free, Chad on Monday announced suspension of all flights effective midnight of March 19, 2020 in an official government statement.

Only cargo planes will be allowed to land at N’Djamena International Airport. Earlier reports said government quarantined a group of French passengers who arrived Sunday. Chad remains the sole Central African country unaffected.

Botswana and Zambia who are also virus-free have announced a series of measures similar to what most African countries have in place.

All schools, colleges and universities in Zambia to close indefinitely this Friday in response to the pandemic. The announcement has been made by the country’s minister of health, Dr Chitalu Chilufya. Zambia yet to report a confirmed case.

Zambia missions abroad have been directed to review visa applications for would-be travelers to Zambia. Foreign travel to high risk countries should be be postponed.

Buses from outside Zambia will not dock at the usual station—the InterCity—but at a dry port. This is to ensure a thorough screening of passengers. Isolation centers have been identified in different parts of the country.

Bars and churches will have restricted hours of operation. The southern African country has so far investigated 28 alerts but results have been negative.

Rwanda, Burkina record new cases

Rwanda and Burkina Faso have recorded increase in their tallies. Rwanda confirmed two new cases of coronavirus bringing the total number to seven.

The country’s ministry of health says of the two, one is a Rwandan woman whose husband had earlier tested positive. The other patient is a German who arrived in Rwanda from Germany on 13 March, then developed a cough and went to the hospital on 15 March.

Authorities in Burkina Faso also said five new cases had been recorded putting the overall tally at fifteen according to the WHO’s coronavirus tracking site.","['30,000 tests', '20,000 tests', '9,315 tests']",,,

This was revealed by the Minister of Public Health Malachie Manaouda on his Twitter account on March 23.

He was replying to a suggestion made by a user to organize mass testing like polio vaccine campaigns. “You will certainly be informed of the collection centers as soon as possible,” the official added.

On his Twitter account, when questioned why suspected covid-19 cases are not quarantined in the Olembé social housing, in Yaoundé, Malachie Manaouda replied that the country was preparing itself to do so.

Let’s note that Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba, promised to donate 20,000 test kits, 100,000 masks, and 1,000 protection equipment to each of the 54 African countries.

On the morning of March 24, the minister indicated that in Douala, Bafoussam, and Yaoundé, the number of confirmed cases was respectively 12, 3 and 51. This brings the number of people tested positive to the covid-19 in the country to 66.

A state-by-state breakdown,"Each state and territory has different rules about Covid-19 tests, from random testing in the ACT to hotspot clinics in NSW and Queensland

A reduction in the number of new confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia has coincided with a decline in the number of people returning from overseas. Australian health authorities in a number of states and territories are now easing up previous restrictions on testing so that at-risk workers or those in hotspots can be tested for possible community transmission.

If you suspect you have coronavirus in Australia and want to get tested, here’s a guide to the criteria in each state and territory. In all jurisdictions you remain eligible for testing if you are showing symptoms and you have recently been overseas or been in contact with a confirmed case.

Australia's coronavirus social distancing rules explained: state by state guidelines Read more

New South Wales

People with fever or flu-like symptoms in Sydney – Waverley, Woollahra, Dee Why, Manly, Ryde, Macquarie Park – and regional NSW: Broken Hill, Lake Macquarie, the Manning Valley, Nowra, south Nowra, Byron Bay and Port Macquarie can now get tested due to concerns about clusters in those areas. You also meet NSW testing criteria if you have a fever or respiratory illness and live in a high-risk location (aged care facilities, boarding houses etc), are an aged care or healthcare worker, identify as Aboriginal in a regional or remote community or have been referred by a GP for testing.

Victoria

Victorians who are over 65, school teachers, childcare workers and firefighters who attend medical emergencies can also get tested if they have symptoms. Healthcare workers, police, and aged care workers were already eligible to get tested.

Queensland

The Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young announced on Monday testing would be done in hotspots on the Gold Coast, Brisbane and in Cairns after 32 cases where the source of the transmission was unknown. The state’s other testing criteria includes people with a fever or respiratory illness and living in a high-risk location (aged care facilities, boarding houses etc), aged care or healthcare workers, and those who identify as Aboriginal in a regional or remote community.

Western Australia

Western Australia expanded its testing last week to include any member of the general public who presents at a Covid-19 clinic with both a fever and an acute respiratory infection. High-risk workers with either of those conditions can get tested, and anyone in a high-risk setting like an aged care facility or detention centre where two or more people have either symptom can get tested.

ACT

The ACT has random testing at Weston Creek and a drive-through testing clinic at Epic (Exhibition Park in Canberra), where anyone with coronavirus symptoms can get tested.

South Australia

You can get tested if you have symptoms and have travelled overseas or interstate in the past 14 days, if you have symptoms and have been in contact with a confirmed case, or if you have symptoms and you are a health or aged care worker.

Tasmania

The existing conditions remain in place. That is, only people with symptoms who have travelled internationally or interstate recently or have had contact with a confirmed case can get tested. However, health and aged care workers with both a respiratory illness and fever can get also tested.

Northern Territory

You can get tested if you have returned from interstate or overseas in the past 14 days and develop a respiratory illness, or have been in contact with a confirmed case, or have severe community-acquired pneumonia and there is no clear cause, or you are a healthcare worker who has a respiratory illness and a fever.

Community transmission

On Sunday, Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said the biggest concern in Australia was the community transmission, which accounts for about 10% of cases nationally.

“I may sound like a broken record at times but community transmission is what worries me most of all,” he said.

“Those are the reason we have brought in the social distancing measures and all the measures to stop the spread.”

He said Australia was in a good place, and achieving good control because the community was mostly complying with what had been asked. He urged people to not travel or have parties over Easter.",['19 tests'],,,

States have set up web pages with locations for coronavirus testing, which has mostly been taking place in hospital wards set apart from regular emergency rooms.

It hasn’t been perfect — there have been lines at some clinics and complaints about communication. But anyone with symptoms who has traveled through countries with an outbreak of the virus, or who might have come into contact with someone who did or who seems sick, can be tested at a wide variety of locations.

There is even a drive-through clinic in South Australia that will let you stay in your car for a swab, a model also used in South Korea.

Planning has been similarly robust in Canada. Health care is normally provided by the provinces there, but after the SARS outbreak, the federal government established an agency to coordinate and help finance testing and treatment during any kind of viral or disease outbreak.

A national laboratory was expanded to become the clearinghouse for tests, which are conducted in some provinces by local authorities.

As in Australia, all medical tests are free under Canada’s public health system, and on Thursday morning, a lawmaker with responsibilities for federal health care told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that there were currently enough test kits for 16,000 patients.

So far, Canada has 103 confirmed cases and has performed 642 tests.

In the United States, little if anything about the process has been efficient or convenient. Tests have been slow to arrive across the country, in part because of a manufacturing problem, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",['642 tests'],,,

Health authorities have privately asked Australian universities to search their campuses for material that could be used to prevent Covid-19 testing shortages.

Brendan Murphy, the chief medical officer, has warned of “extreme pressures” on Covid-19 testing kits, swabs, and the chemical reagents used to extract the genetic material critical to the testing process.

Australia has now conducted more than 160,000 Covid-19 tests, a relatively high number compared to other nations.

But both Murphy and the World Health Organization say a stronger testing regime, with broader testing criteria, is needed to effectively slow the spread of Covid-19.

Australia’s ability to test more broadly has been hampered by pressure on the stocks of testing material available.

'Clarity and compassion': what Australia can learn from New Zealand's coronavirus response Read more

The Guardian has learned that last week Australian universities were asked to search their campuses for stores of flocked swabs, nucleic acid extraction kits, and PCR instruments, which help amplify and detect genetic material. They were also asked to identify any capability to produce the primers and probes used in PCR instruments.

Universities were asked to report back to the chief medical officer, detailing their available supplies.

Correspondence from within the University of Queensland suggests its academics were doubtful they held any such supplies.

“Institutions have been asked to report on stores of reagents to the chief medical officer as they are needed for Covid-19 testing, and there are shortages,” UQ’s pharmaceutical academics were told.

“The faculty realises that for most, perhaps all, of you it is very unlikely you will have stores of [the] reagents in question.”

A health spokeswoman confirmed the department was conducting contingency planning to deal with compromised global supply chains caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

“The department is exploring a number of possible pathology resources including through the university sector,” she said. “This is consistent with contingency planning for pandemic response when global supply chains are uncertain and may be compromised.”

Universities are not the only ones being asked to supply the government with testing material.

Last week, the government issued an urgent callout to industry – both in Australia and abroad – to identify companies who could manufacture swabs.

Companies were asked to provide “nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs which will be suitable for Covid-19 sample collection”, tender records show.

Potential suppliers were given until midday Wednesday to express their interest, and the government will immediately begin asking for quotes once the expression of interest process is complete.

“The [expression of interest] will provide us with an understanding of domestic suppliers, as well as potential new suppliers internationally,” the industry department said in a statement.

Earlier this month, the Guardian revealed that Murphy had written directly to GPs, warning them of the strain on supplies of testing material and personal protective equipment.

“Unfortunately, the extreme pressure on our personal protective equipment stocks continues, and the situation regarding pathology test kits, reagents and swabs is deteriorating rapidly, with kits no longer being available in some regions of the country,” Murphy wrote.

“Pathology collection centres have also experienced large backlogs in testing appointments in some parts of Australia, and emergency testing facilities have had to be established in some areas to ensure that urgent patients can get access to testing.”

Australia has since received significant stocks of testing kits. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, confirmed that an additional 63,000 coronavirus test kits had arrived on Tuesday and almost 100,000 were received in the past week.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration has also approved four companies to supply a different type of test to Australia.

That test – an initial screening test – detects antibodies deployed by the body to fight the virus, and does not need laboratory process. Some experts have voiced concern about that method of testing, because antibodies only emerge some days after symptoms appear.

But the TGA said its expedited approval of the testing kits was “based on evidence provided to the TGA at the time of application”, and the health department and World Health Organization say that antibody testing has merit and could prove important in tackling the pandemic.

One of the companies that secured TGA approval is Melbourne-based MD Solutions, which will begin importing the tests within a fortnight. The company plans to supply about 500,000 kits in its initial shipment.",['19 tests'],,,

To ensure compliance, state authorities enacted sweeping powers to impose hefty fines and potential jail terms on anybody breaching rules that include a ban on public meetings of more than just two people.

Health Minister Greg Hunt reported there were about 4,400 coronavirus cases nationally, with the rate of growth in new infections slowing to an average of 9% over the past three days from 25-30% a week earlier.

The death toll in a country of almost 25 million stood at 19, putting the death rate for Australian cases below 1%, which is under the 10% reported by some countries and suggests “early promising signs of the curve flattening,” Hunt said.

“That’s an achievement to which all Australians have contributed,” he said in a televised news conference.

Countries around the world are seeking to “flatten the curve” representing growth in infections by implementing social distancing and other containment measures so that hospitals are not overwhelmed with critically ill patients.

Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital, said while Australia stopped short of full lockdowns imposed elsewhere, it had introduced social distancing measures relatively early.

“We acted much earlier than the likes of Italy and the United States,” Collignon told Reuters. “We had much less community transmission and we still shut our borders and implemented social distancing policies such as shutting down bars and pubs, and did much more testing.”

Collignon noted there may be an element of luck in the current trend, and backed official moves to keep social interactions to a minimum.

Several states introduced penalties on Tuesday for people flouting social distancing requirements. The repercussions differ from state to state, but include fines of up to A$11,000 ($6,780), a potential six-month prison term and the requirement to wear an electronic tracking device.

CURVE FLATTENING

Philip Russo, president of the Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control, said talk of curve flattening was “premature”.

“We need to have weeks on end of decreasing numbers of new cases on a daily basis,” Russo said. “What we are seeing now is quite possibly normal daily variation.”

The government’s own caution was highlighted by a deal to boost the public health system with an extra 34,000 hospital beds sourced from private hospitals, along with thousands of doctors and nurses. Australia will also take delivery of more than 5,000 ventilators at the end of April, Health Minister Hunt said.

Health officials said earlier they wanted to increase testing, especially in places of COVID-19 clusters like Sydney’s Bondi area, which drew attention this month after people ignored social distancing rules and flocked to the beach. State officials said the virus may have been transmitted in the Bondi community via a backpacker unaware of having the disease.

Qantas Airways Ltd said on Tuesday that six baggage handlers at Adelaide airport have tested positive for the virus, adding that other employees who had come into contact with the infected staff would self-isolate.

Like many countries, Australia’s financial and jobs markets have been roiled by the outbreak, prompting the government to unveil several stimulus packages.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said 113,000 businesses had registered for a A$130 billion ($80 billion) six-month wage subsidy designed to stop spiraling unemployment and business closures.

I’ve been here 25 years, 10 of them in intensive care. This is like nothing I’ve ever seen before,” Michelle Spence says.

“I’ve described it as like preparing for a war. There’s no doubt about it.”

Spence is the nurse unit manager of Royal Melbourne Hospital’s intensive care unit, a 32-bed operation staffed by teams of highly-trained clinicians.

Not infrequently, at least 30 of those beds will be occupied by critically ill patients.

But right now, there’s a lull. The effect of physical distancing restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus has slowed the flow of patients into the hospital.

Fewer people on the streets means fewer road accidents and less of the trauma that is the bread and butter of intensive care and emergency hospital departments.

It’s given doctors, nurses, allied health workers and the myriad support workers in Australia’s major hospitals something their colleagues in Italy, the United States and Spain missed out on: time.

Time to plan. Time to buy supplies and test equipment. Time to build space and hire and train staff. Hospitals care for critically ill patients every day but not in the numbers or at the scale that has become globally associated with Covid-19.

Guardian Australia interviewed health workers around the country, from densely populated cities such as Melbourne, up to remote communities in the Torres Strait, about how they are preparing for a potential influx of patients requiring treatment for the highly contagious disease.

The general public and the community can save more lives than intensive care will be able to Chris MacIsaac

The approach hospitals are taking varies based on geography and the volume of resources and clinicians they have to call on. But frontline workers uniformly described the work under way as regimented, repetitive, with “thousands of hours” put in.

Most expressed a single fear. That even the best planning will not be enough if individuals do not follow government restrictions related to physical contact.

“I think right now, the general public and the community can save more lives than intensive care will be able to,” Chris MacIsaac, the head of Royal Melbourne hospital’s intensive care unit, says.

“It’s vital that the curve is flattened so the peak is not as high.”

The major metropolitan hospital

In the intensive care unit of Royal Melbourne hospital, a major public hospital in the inner suburb of Parkville, doctors and nurses are practising intubation of a coronavirus patient experiencing respiratory failure.

The hospital’s ICU has not yet had a Covid-19-positive patient but clinicians are running simulations using a dummy.

It’s a complex task, typically performed by one to two critical care doctors and specially-trained nurses who administer medication to stop the patient breathing, insert a tube into the mouth and through the voice box, and initiate artificial breathing using a ventilator.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Royal Melbourne hospital intensive care unit nurses perform drills in readiness for Covid-19 patients. Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian

It’s a procedure that comes with a high risk of exposure to the infection, so Royal Melbourne is practising intubating patients using a minimum number of staff, clothed in personal protective equipment (known as PPE), in a negative pressure room.

The drills are run daily in intensive care, the emergency department and theatres.

MacIsaac says the whole hospital is now running as an emergency operations centre. It’s a framework that exists for major external emergencies, such as a disaster with mass casualties, that demand a large-scale response.

“This is a little different because we’ve got such a lead-up time, but the structure of control and command has been in place for weeks,” he says.

For hospitals responding to the coronavirus pandemic, the critical element is their ability to care simultaneously for a large influx of seriously ill patients.

In the worst-hit countries, hospitals have been overwhelmed and the contagious nature of Covid-19 has led to high rates of infections, as well as deaths, among healthcare workers.

Looking after a critically ill patient is more than just connecting them to machines Chris MacIsaac

One of the greatest times of risk of contamination is when staff remove protective equipment, so clinicians are refreshing their knowledge of how to don and doff protective gear safely.

ICU patients require sophisticated treatment. Monitoring of heart rates and oxygen levels. Administration of medication and nutrition.

Teams are regularly practising how to flip a patient into a prone position, a technique that has been effective for some Covid-19 patients whose oxygen levels fall dangerously low.

“Looking after a critically ill patient is more than just connecting them to machines,” MacIsaac says.

“A lot of care goes into looking after a critically ill patient and they require highly trained people.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Royal Melbourne hospital head of intensive care Chris MacIsaac. Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian

The hospital currently has 32 staffed beds in its intensive care unit. They’re looking to increase that to 100 by repurposing other parts of the precinct, including the old ICU that closed in 2016, and the recovery room of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Even that might not be enough.

MacIsaac says right now they could ventilate 50 patients. The hospital is in negotiations with the Victorian government as to what their allocation from any new supplies will be.

But it is his view that “the rate-limiting step” in their capacity to treat people will not be equipment.

“What we’re putting a lot of effort into is staffing,” he says.

Across the country, state health departments have been seeking expressions of interest from nurses and midwives, medical workers, allied health professionals, paramedics and patient services assistants.

Spence, as the nurse unit manager, has carriage of a recruitment drive that will train 100 to 200 additional nurses to work in intensive care.

Team members are cold-calling and interviewing potentially suitable candidates but the majority will be nurses who are already working on other wards within the hospital.

Typically, they would complete a six-month training course but there is only time for what Spence calls a fast-tracked program in survival skills.

“We’re providing that over four days,” she says.

The equipment problem

As hospitals race to prepare themselves for the pandemic’s peak, three critical resourcing issues repeatedly crop up: access to ventilators, personal protective equipment and beds.

Ventilators are used to assist the failing lungs of the most seriously-ill Covid-19 patients.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ventilators in the Royal Melbourne hospital intensive care unit. Photograph: Christopher Hopkins/The Guardian

Shortages in places like Italy have caused disaster and pointless loss of life as ICUs struggle to meet extraordinary demand with limited resources.

In Australia, estimates of the current level of resourcing suggest there are 2,378 beds across 191 ICUs, each with a ventilator.

The government wants to dramatically boost that number.

The question is: are there enough ventilators – and the staff needed to operate them – to support such a surge?

Modelling released this week suggests Australia has capacity to surge to an additional 4,261 beds, up by 189%.

But there are only an extra 2,361 invasive ventilators to support such a surge.

To address a potential shortfall, the federal government has set up a ventilator taskforce, made up of government and industry experts, which is working urgently to bolster stocks.

The current strategy is four-fold. First, significantly boost the production of Australia’s only onshore manufacturer of ventilators, a company named Resmed.

Second, activate all reserves of ventilators that exist in Australia, including those currently being used in veterinary clinics. Third, purchase more ventilators from overseas suppliers, like Draeger, a German company.

And finally, set up arrangements for new domestic manufacturers to utilise existing ventilator designs held by overseas manufacturers, already approved by foreign regulators, to begin producing the machines or parts in Australia.

Australia's major measures to tackle coronavirus are now in place, Scott Morrison says Read more

There is confidence from members of the taskforce that this will be enough to meet even the worst-case scenarios.

But adequate supply of ventilators is not the only problem. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association’s chief executive, Alison Verhoeven, says the issue will be ensuring the machines are deployed in a way that maximises their coverage of the population.

“[It will be about] having smart plans in place to shift patients out of areas where there might not be ventilators available – and I’m thinking rural and regional areas – to centralised facilities,” Verhoeven told the Guardian.

“That’s part of the planning that state health departments have been doing and each of them will have slightly different responses.”

Similarly, access to PPE – masks, gowns, goggles, and gloves – remains a risk to hospital preparedness. Adequate PPE is critical to safely treating Covid-19 patients. Yet many hospitals are already reporting dwindling stocks, particularly in the not-for-profit sector.

University of Sydney decision sciences expert, Professor Ben Fahimnia, said he would not be surprised if “hospitals will soon rely on public donations of face masks for health workers”.

“Building new production capacity in Australia where we have spent decades economising through offshoring is not easy,” he said. “Even if it is possible to force local production today, it is very unlikely to keep pace with this current pandemic-spurred demand.”

The referral centre

This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said Australia’s trajectory – that is the rate at which Covid-19 infections are increasing – was showing “promising, encouraging” signs of slowing after the implementation of enforced social distancing measures.

“But there are no guarantees,” he said.

If we get to three to four weeks down the track and things aren’t mayhem, we’ll be encouraged Dr Bruce Ashford

Dr Bruce Ashford a head and neck surgeon at Wollongong hospital, on the New South Wales coast thinks it’s too early for optimism. He is coordinating the hospital’s Covid-19 task force, a multidisciplinary team that includes respiratory, emergency and logistical specialists.

Ashford describes planning a response to the pandemic as “looking over a cliff into the unknown”.

“If we get to three to four weeks down the track and things aren’t mayhem, we’ll be encouraged,” he says.

“But I just don’t think there’s enough history to indicate how this is going to go, which is why we have to plan for the worst-case scenario.”

Wollongong hospital is the major referral centre in the Illawarra Shoalhaven local health district, which comprises eight hospitals.

It has had what Ashford calls a “disproportionate” number of Covid-19 patients relative to population size. This week the hospital recorded its first death, a 75-year-old man who had been a passenger on the Ovation of the Seas cruise ship.

Ashford and colleagues have spent countless hours poring over issues such as how patients with Covid-19 will move through the hospital upon their arrival. Core areas – emergency, theatres, intensive care – have been arranged so they are close together, the goal being to minimise contact between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients.

The ICU is being separated and expanded to 45 beds for Covid-19 patients and 21 for critically ill non-Covid patients. There’s capacity to increase that by another 10, with 40 to 50 ventilators.

Coordinating a response to a 24/7 emergency is complex and several people need to contribute. Doctors and nurses, cleaners, supply and logistics teams, caterers. Strategies have had to be developed to help Covid-19 patients, who can receive no visitors, communicate with their loved ones.

Everything before a pandemic seems like an overreaction and everything after seems like an underreaction Dr Bruce Ashford

At the same time, the day-to-day running of the health service continues and the impact of every decision on other, smaller, hospitals in the region has to be weighed.

“The whole effort is based around this idea that everything before a pandemic seems like an overreaction and everything after seems like an underreaction,” Ashford says.

He says one advantage in Australia’s favour is that the health system has been able to observe and learn from the experience in other countries. This week, the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced an extra $1.3bn towards integrating the private hospital system into the Covid-19 response.

“However, does that mean our efforts are going to be adequate? Probably not,” Ashford says.

“I can’t imagine that there’s something so special about Australia that we’re going to be different to the rest of the world.

“You look at New York, Milan and Madrid, they are on their last legs. And you think, what would that be like for us?”

A hospital committee including a medical ethicist and senior clinicians is discussing what will be done in the event there are more critically ill patients than resources or ventilators to care for them. There are similar committees, or frameworks, looking at this dilemma in other health districts around the country.

Ashford says if it gets to that stage, extremely tough decisions will be inevitable and there will be frank conversations with patients and families about their wishes, as well the constraints on the hospital.

The two meetings that changed the trajectory of Australia's coronavirus response Read more

Sara Arcioni, a senior registrar in the hospital’s ICU, says frontline workers are used to the emotional load that comes with treating critically ill patients.

“It’s just that we may be dealing with many more,” she says.

The nation’s capital

Around the country, plans are being drawn up for how hospitals could increase their capacity beyond their existing facilities.

Important regional facilities like Wagga Wagga base hospital have increased ICU capacity and set up procedures to separate the flow of suspected patients, while in Sydney, the Royal Prince Alfred hospital has prepared a dedicated and specially-designed Covid-19 intensive care unit.

Major hotels, already being used as quarantine zones for returned travellers, could be converted into wards. In Victoria, the government is developing plans to convert the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition centre into a hospital and morgue.

In Canberra this week, the ACT government announced it was working with healthcare company Aspen Medical to rapidly build a temporary emergency department for moderately to severely ill Covid-19 patients.

It is also setting up an unregistered workforce made up of volunteers from the community – academics, students and a range of people with health backgrounds – after issuing a callout. Nine hundred people registered.

At present, Australia’s capital has emergency departments at two of its hospitals – Canberra hospital in the city’s south and Calvary Public hospital in the city’s north – and has recorded 93 cases of coronavirus, including two deaths this week.

Emergency folk are practical folk. I know several of my colleagues, myself included, have made their first will David Caldicott

From Monday, Canberra healthcare workers will start looking more actively for evidence of transmission of the disease in the community by testing a random selection of people who would otherwise not meet the criteria for testing.

David Caldicott is an emergency department consultant to Calvary Hospital and a lecturer at the Australian National University Medical School.

He said there was anxiety, but not panic, in the emergency community about the potential impact of Covid-19 on frontline workers’ own health.

“Emergency folk are practical folk. I know several of my colleagues, myself included, have made their first will,” Caldicott says.

He says the biggest concern for health workers was that people who were not in essential roles such as aged care, retail, delivery and cleaning, followed the physical distancing measures.

“The frontline is at your front door. It’s entirely up to the public to decide how bad this is going to be,” he says.

At Canberra’s hospitals, teams are running drills in full PPE to prepare for how they will manage different types of Covid-19 positive patients, such as a woman in labour, or a deteriorating patient who needs to be transferred to theatre.

Working in PPE – mask, goggles, gown and gloves – takes a physical toll. It’s hot and there’s a risk of dehydration. The greatest physical burden is often borne by nurses who have the most direct contact with patients.

Bernadette McDonald, the chief executive of Canberra Health Services, said considerable time was being spent on staff welfare and support for workers who might be feeling anxiety.

Some major Australian hospitals have been expanding their existing staff support services by bringing in additional psychologists and social workers, and organisations that will supply meals and nutrition for frontline teams.

“At this point in time they are the most important people because they’re the people who care for everyone that gets sick,” McDonald says.

The regions

In Emerald in Queensland’s central highlands a rural fever clinic has been built out of four dongas, each consisting of two rooms, a shower and toilet.

Only a week ago, the site was empty space next to the practice run by GP and obstetrician Ewan McPhee, who is also the president of the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine.

The clinic – one of 100 GP-led respiratory clinics the federal government is funding as part of its Covid-19 response – has been set up to direct patients with symptoms away from the hospital.

Nurses and GPs at the clinic will swab people who meet the criteria for coronavirus testing.

Emerald itself has a population of about 15,000 people. There are another 45,000 in the wider district. Emerald hospital has 30 beds and four ventilators.

“The worst-case scenario for Emerald in the next three months would be 60 people requiring ventilation and we only have four ventilators,” McPhee says.

Federal and state leaders and mayors of councils have pleaded with Australians in recent weeks not to make unnecessary travel into regional and remote communities where the health infrastructure is not set up to cope with a massive surge in patients.

Rural Australia already battles with shortages of frontline medical workers. The arrival of Covid-19 and quarantine restrictions has complicated that further in some places with doctors that were on fly-in fly-out arrangements.

Emerald has not yet had a patient test positive for Covid-19 but McPhee is concerned the disease will ultimately make its way into the community via southern Queensland. He thinks the testing criteria needs to be expanded so that doctors can test when they suspect a patient has coronavirus and start monitoring community transmission.

Separating Covid and non-Covid patients is immediately difficult for rural hospitals in terms of having the physical building space available. McPhee says medical teams in Emerald were having to consider solutions such as managing some hospital patients in their homes.

Some very unwell patients would need to be transferred by helicopter or with the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Rockhampton or Brisbane.

If the town becomes overrun, they would have to either convert the clinic into a treatment space, or call on the military to establish a field hospital.

McPhee said there was enormous pressure on rural health workers who would have “nowhere to hide” in the face of such an emergency and he feels the urgency of the situation has not been fully grasped.

“It’s the community that has to make the decision about their future. We can’t fix the problem once it’s in a surge situation,” he said.

“That’s what’s going to save Emerald. It’s not going to be a GP-led respiratory clinic. It’s going to be people doing the right thing.”

Further north, Tony Brown is the incident controller for the Covid-19 response for the Torres and Cape hospital and health service.

Ordinarily he works as a rural generalist, gynaecologist and obstetrician on Thursday Island but for the duration of the pandemic he will be based in Cairns.

The majority of the population in the area covered by the Torres and Cape Health Service is Indigenous. There have been no confirmed Covid-19 cases so far and much of the health strategy is focused on trying to keep the disease out of the community. There is a 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers to the islands.

If a doctor or nurse suspects a patient has coronavirus, that person has to isolate themselves at home. Brown says the health service intends to transfer confirmed positive cases to accommodation in Cairns for isolation but “we need to be ready for anything”.

“We don’t know what’s coming our way and how many people are going to be affected,” Brown says.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities are among the Australians most at risk of becoming severely ill due to Covid-19.

Last week frontline doctors said they were preparing for “death and suffering” in these communities because of a lack of resources and many have gone into lockdown.

The Torres and Cape hospital and health service has four hospitals – Thursday Island, Bamaga, Cooktown and Weipa – the largest of which has 26 beds and the smallest about six. There are 31 primary healthcare clinics run by nurses. Three new ventilators are on order but the plan is for any patient requiring ventilation to be flown to Cairns.

If demand on the small health teams becomes too great, they would need to ask for assistance, including from the army.

“We’ve got the capacity to deal with only a certain number of people in our hospitals because we only have so many resources to manage them,” Brown said.

“So we have a tipping point where we turn to the state and say ‘we’re not coping’.”

By creating more space between yourself and others you decrease the risk of person-to-person spread.

Read more: Coronavirus: why should we stay 1.5 metres away from each other?

It’s also essential that confirmed cases, those awaiting test results and people who have recently returned from overseas self-isolate for a minimum of 14 days.

The purpose of these public health measures, and others such as practising good hand hygiene and cough etiquette, is to “flatten the curve” or mitigate the spread of COVID-19.

If we don’t slow the spread of the virus and decrease the number of people with it at any given time, our health-care system – and intensive care units in particular – will struggle to cope.

What would uncontrolled spread look like?

As Australian mathematician Joel Miller, from La Trobe University, wrote on The Conversation, without public health interventions, the virus could spread quickly and infect a large proportion of the population:

COVID-19’s observed doubling time has been about four days. That means every four days the number of cases has been roughly double what it was four days prior. We would calculate it takes about three months for one infection doubling every four days to cause 15 million infections. After the peak, we expect the total time to drop to be about the same as it took to rise. This gives a crude prediction of six months.

Read more: Scott Morrison has said we'll face at least 6 months of disruption. Where does that number come from?

According to data from China, around 5% of people who test positive to COVID-19 will experience severe symptoms and require admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for around four weeks.

So, three months into the pandemic, without public health measures to control the spread, we could have expected to see 750,000 severe cases requiring admission to ICU in the first three months.

What can our ICUs cope with?

We currently have just over 2,200 ICU beds.

Assuming all ICU beds will be reserved for coronavirus patients, statistician Megan Higgie from James Cook University has estimated that when Australia has 44,580 infected patients, all our ICU beds will be full.

Based on these estimates, Higgie suggests we could run out of ICU beds in early April.

And, of course, chronic conditions and traumatic injuries will persist and people without coronavirus will continue to need intensive care.

What impact can public health measures have?

Modelling published this week by Imperial College London suggests that implementing all available mitigation options, including social distancing and home isolation, could dramatically reduce pressure on ICUs.

The researchers estimate that over a three-month period, these measures could reduce demand for ICU beds by 69%.

But even with the public health measures we have in place to control the spread of COVID-19, the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society suggest the number of ICU beds may have to double to cope with the increased demand.

We don’t just need more beds, we need nurses to staff them

Nurses will need to be mobilised to provide this additional ICU care.

In Australian ICUs, the nurse to patient ratio is 1:1, so one nurse looks after one patient. This is due to the highly complex care needs of these patients who require constant observation, assessment and treatment to remain stable.

We need to identify nurses with critical care qualifications or experience who can be redeployed to address this increased demand.

Nurses who specialise in medical and surgical fields could also be deployed to work in ICUs under supervision.

Recently retired nurses could be called on to rejoin the workforce, as well as those with registration but not practising.

Current leave and future leave from work may need to be limited or cancelled and other health professionals, including defence personnel and student nurses, working under supervision, could be called on to boost the overall nursing workforce.

What else can hospitals do to cope with the increased demand?

As the pandemic evolves, hospitals will experience a triple threat of more patients, reduced numbers of clinical staff as some become infected, and increased illness intensity.

We need to protect front-line health workers from contracting COVID-19 or becoming exhausted, which will also reduce absenteeism.

Hospitals may also need to:

discharge patients from hospital more quickly than previously

postpone admissions for all non-critical procedures

increase the remote and virtual care capabilities, such as telehealth and care hotlines, to treat patients at home

activate alternate care sites such as hotels or small private hospitals for patients requiring low levels of care so we can save large tertiary hospitals for those with greatest need.

This is an unprecedented global public health crisis. Our health systems will be under tremendous pressure over the next several weeks and months, requiring rapid adaptation to meet the needs.

The social distancing measures we adopt now will help us to deliver the best care to patients and each other when we need it.

Australia,04-05-2020 00:00,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/manufacturing-face-shields-mat-bowtell-3d-printing-australia-fight-coronavirus,Manufacturing face shields within days: how Australian industry is pivoting to fight coronavirus,"Mat Bowtell’s charitable prosthetics enterprise has swiftly moved to personal protective equipment, as the manufacturing sector responds to Covid-19

A choice lay before engineer Mat Bowtell as he walked out the gates of Toyota’s Altona factory for the last time. He could watch on, helpless, as the local car manufacturing industry fell apart around him, or he could put his skills to better use.

Bowtell used his redundancy payout to set up a 3D printing facility in a small warehouse on Victoria’s Bass coast, where he began manufacturing free prosthetic hands for children with a disability.

Now, as Covid-19 fractures the economy and brings entire industries to their knees, Bowtell’s skills have again found a new purpose.

Fourteen of his 20 3D printers are now being used to manufacture thousands of face shields for healthcare workers, who are struggling to access personal protective equipment amid widespread shortages.

“With 3D printing, we’ve been able to go from making hands to making face shields in a matter of, well, days,” he told the Guardian. “To completely revamp our line, that’s how agile this technology is and how flexible it is.”

“It’s mind-blowing.”

Bowtell’s story is not unique. All across the country, catastrophe has caused remarkable transformations. Industry in the pandemic age is finding strange ways to meet the strangest of demands. Local gin distilleries are making hand sanitiser. Carmakers are offering design expertise for hospital ventilators.

Detmold, a food packaging company, is now producing surgical masks. Textor, a company that previously created materials for nappies, sanitary pads and baby wipes, has repurposed its business toward personal protective equipment (PPE) with the help of the CSIRO.

The manufacturing industry’s guide during this pandemic-induced transformation is the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, a not-for-profit working with the federal government.

It is trying to help the sector pivot into Covid-19-related work, setting up a central portal where businesses can register their skills, supplies, and capabilities.

“Once we set up the portal, heaven broke loose,” the AMGC managing director, Dr Jens Goennemann, told the Guardian.

“Up to today, we had 1,000 registrations from companies who not only said ‘I want to help’, but they said how they could do that.”

“So that means we can make a heat map of different skills and capabilities, which we can then throw at the most targeted need.”

The speed of the pivot has been remarkable. But it has also raised a broader question.

Before the crisis, only a single Australian factory, Med-Con’s Shepparton plant, was producing surgical masks. Similarly, there was only one significant onshore producer of ventilators, a company named Resmed.

Labor senator Kim Carr, a former industry minister, says this highlights a failing that extends well beyond just PPE and ventilators.

How, he asks, has Australia allowed key strategic industries to disappear? And why has it taken a crisis for Australia’s shortcomings to be so greatly exposed?

“This is a profound problem now,” Carr says. “For even the most simple-minded of our rightwing economists, understanding the implications of these matters surely now demonstrates the importance of us developing a more economically complex society and a more sovereign nation.”

The consequences of shortages in PPE, as one example, have been thrown into sharp relief in recent weeks.

The paucity of supplies forced hospitals to stop elective surgeries and left aged care providers with serious threats to their ability to deliver services.

Workers at dialysis units have been left to scrounge for their own masks, despite their patients being one of the most at-risk groups from Covid-19. A cancer treatment centre had to begin producing its own sanitiser using donated chemicals after vast quantities mysteriously went missing from its stores.

Catholic Healthcare Australia, which represents members with 80 hospitals, warned the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, the situation was dire and that it held “grave concerns” about PPE access.

Local manufacturing has now become a critical part of the pandemic response, both in Australia and across the world.

The World Health Organization has urged every country to boost its domestic PPE production by 40%.

“Without secure supply chains, the risk to healthcare workers around the world is real,” WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can’t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first.”

The Australian government has responded with a multifaceted strategy. It issued a callout to domestic industry to understand who may be able to pivot into PPE manufacturing, while releasing stocks from the reserves in the national medical stockpile. It has also sent the army in to help Med-Con, which is aiming to double or triple its production.

Exports of PPE have also been banned.

Some say Australia’s current situation exposes a failing of crisis planning.

The chair of the Australian Healthcare Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett, said the gradual offshoring of PPE production was “clearly extremely risky” in the event of a pandemic.

“This situation should prompt a rethink of our approach over the past several decades to move away from domestic manufacturing towards a reliance on imports,” she said. “This may save money in the short term but it is costing us now. In a wealthy country like Australia, it is unacceptable to risk the lives of health professionals because we do not have the facilities to manufacture simple materials such as masks and swabs.”

Unions take a similar view. The national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union, Paul Bastian, told the Guardian: “I think this crisis has certainly exposed the dangers of destroying Australian manufacturing and relying entirely on an import-based model.

“Of course, as we move forward out of this crisis sometime in the future, we hope that government continues to invest in Australian manufacturing, as they have to do right now when they don’t have an alternative.”

Adamm Ferrier, a lecturer in public health at La Trobe University who helped set up Health Purchasing Victoria, agrees that there has been a “movement offshore of many manufacturing processes to countries where labour costs are more competitive”.

But Ferrier also says the problem is partly explained by the way hospitals had changed their stocking of PPE in recent years.

“Since the 1990s there has been a movement towards a ‘just in time’ supply practice that replaced a ‘just in case’ practice, where hospitals held vast quantities of supplies that often went out of date,” he said.

“The ‘just in time’ practice has served the system well, but was always predicated on the ability for the manufacture and medical supply chain to respond nimbly to changes in demand.”

Goennemann, a leader in the industry, disputes suggestions that manufacturing is in decline in Australia.

He is careful to distinguish Australia’s manufacturing sector from what people generally associate it with – producing things in factories. Production, he says, is just one part of the manufacturing process, along with research, development, design, logistics, distribution, sales and services.

In fact, Goennemann said Australia may be uniquely placed to respond. He points to 3D printing, of which Australia has an “incredible onshore capability”, as an example.

“The 3D printing capability onshore is a massive distinguisher for Australia to step up to the crisis,” he said.

When asked how else 3D printing might be deployed in practice, Goennemann points to the supply of ventilators, which are needed to assist breathing in the most seriously ill Covid-19 patients.

A lack of ventilators has been a critical issue in countries like Italy, where doctors in swamped intensive care units have been forced to make heart-wrenching decisions about who gets access to the life-saving machines.

Australia has about 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the country. The government wants to increase the number of ICU beds dramatically to prepare for the peak of the pandemic, and is attempting to source more ventilators through a combination of domestic production, procurement from abroad, and the conversion of existing equipment, including from veterinarians.

Goennemann says Resmed, the main ventilator manufacturer, could struggle to get parts due to the disruption of global supply chains.

That’s where 3D printing can help.

“I don’t want to speak on behalf of Resmed, but that’s an area where we have critical supply, and parts can be 3D printed onshore rather than being procured offshore,” he said.

The industry minister, Karen Andrews, is heading up the government’s efforts to ramp up domestic production of PPE and ventilators. A special unit has been convened within her department to specifically look at PPE supply.

Aboriginal health services warn of 'catastrophic' shortage of coronavirus protective equipment Read more

Andrews says the response of industry is a testament to the ingenuity that exists in Australia.

“So many companies are putting up their hands to help – whether it’s ramping up manufacturing, looking to switch up what they produce, or even just connecting with each other to make sure they have what they need,” she said.

For Bowtell, the decision to shift his production to face shields had nothing to do with profit. It was about doing what he could in the most extraordinary of times.

“It’s about survival at the moment,” Bowtell said. “Just helping people to get through this together.”",,"['2,300 ventilators']",,
Taiwan,03-10-2020 00:00,https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-03-10/lessons-learned-from-taiwans-response-to-coronavirus,Lessons Learned From Taiwan’s Response to Coronavirus,"With conflicting and at times contradictory messages coming out of the White House, the Dow Jones Industrial Average seesawing and even the most basic supplies such as hand-sanitizer in short supply, the United States – a country with a history of helping other nations conquer pandemics – got off to an agonizingly slow start in trying to contain coronavirus.

Wondering what an aggressive pandemic response looks like? Look to Taiwan, says Dr. C. Jason Wang, director of Stanford University's Center for Policy, Outcomes and Prevention.

Following the 2003 SARS epidemic, Taiwan dramatically built up its public health infrastructure to launch an immediate response to the next crisis.

Well-trained and experienced public health officials were quick to recognize the crisis and launched an emergency public health response to contain the emerging outbreak, Wang and colleagues from the United States and Taiwan reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

""If you let the fire burn, you could lose control of the critical moment when we could deal with it and put it out faster,"" Wang says. ""The impact is much greater.""

An island just 81 miles off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan was a COVID-19 catastrophe waiting to happen. More than 850,000 of the island's 23 million citizens actually live in mainland China. Another 400,000 work there. Last year, nearly 3 million people from mainland China touched down in Taiwan, bringing billions of microbial hitchhikers with them, as travelers always do.

The virus picked the worst possible moment, just days before the Lunar New Year, to shift its base of operations from the animal kingdom into humans. It is a time when millions of Chinese and Taiwanese travel for the holidays. Many stream through Wuhan, the outbreak's apparent point of origin and one of just four major Chinese railway hubs.

Yet, against all odds, Taiwan has remained relatively coronavirus free. As of March 8, the World Health Organization had logged just 45 COVID-19 cases and one death since China notified WHO of the outbreak in late December. Not a single case has been reported in the last 24 hours. China's caseload now stands at about 81,000 with 3,100 deaths.

""It really does speak to the importance of planning,"" says Jeremy Youde, dean of liberal arts at the University of Minnesota Duluth and an internationally recognized expert on global health politics. ""Not just the policy responses, but knowing what kinds of assets we have on the ground.""

""We don't suddenly have 100,000 hospital beds lying around that could be used in the event of an outbreak.""

How has Taiwan, a country on China's doorstep, managed to contain COVID-19 when so many countries have failed? One answer is leadership, and at the very top. Taiwan's vice president, Chen Chien-jen, is an epidemiologist who received his doctorate at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. He was formerly vice president of Taiwan's premier research institution.

Taiwan learned the hard way – in the SARS coronavirus epidemic in 2003 – what can happen when something goes wrong. For the first couple of months after the World Health Organization posted its first global SARS alert, Taiwan was spared the brunt of the epidemic. The island tallied just 29 probable cases and no deaths and the growth rate was relatively slow, typical of a minor outbreak.

That changed on April 22, 2003, when a cluster of seven infections were reported in Hoping Hospital in Taipei. Desperate to limit the spread of the infection within the hospital, administrators dispersed SARS patients to other hospitals.

Those infections sparked a cascade of local transmissions that culminated in 116 probable cases and 10 deaths in just two weeks, according to a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.

By mid-May, Taiwan's caseload soared to 264 cases and 34 deaths. By June 1, the outbreak had roughly tripled, reaching 680 cases and 81 deaths, a six-fold increase in less than a month. Ten of the dead were Taiwanese health workers; seven worked at Hoping Hospital.

Subsequent after-action reports laid blame for the massive flare-up on a lack of preparation, mismanagement and carelessness. Taiwanese health officials vowed not to get caught unprepared again. They established a National Health Command Center as the hub of a number of smaller centers charged with responding to epidemics, biological pathogens, bioterrorism and medical emergencies.

The instant Taiwanese officials learned that China notified the World Health Organization of a pneumonia of unknown origin, on Dec. 31, 2019, they sent health workers to board planes from Wuhan and assess passengers for fever or pneumonia before they were allowed to disembark on the island.

Within a week, they expanded their surveillance net to include anyone who had traveled to Wuhan in the previous two weeks. And by Jan. 20, the government activated the Central Epidemic Command Center and charged it with coordinating all government efforts to combat the growing health crisis. In an effort to contain the epidemic, Taiwan employed the most powerful tools at its disposal – big data and analytics.

The country, which has a national health insurance program, was able to link its national health insurance database with its customs and immigration records and quickly identify anyone who entered the country from China and sought medical care. Health officials began testing patients for coronavirus if they had severe respiratory illness and a negative influenza test so they could identify unsuspected cases and anyone with whom the patients might have had contact.

A toll-free number was established so that citizens could report suspicious symptoms or cases. As the outbreak grew, the hotline was overwhelmed and cities were asked to establish their own toll-free numbers.

In a matter of days, the government created a list of 124 ""action items,"" including land and sea border controls, active case finding and quarantine of people with suspected infection and making sure the health system has the resources needed to manage disease.

The government also launched an educational campaign to inform and calm a frightened public and combat misinformation. On the policy front, plans were drawn up for dealing with infections in child care settings, schools and businesses. Taiwanese schools are easier to manage than U.S. schools, because the students do not disperse and rotate from class to class. Instead the teachers rotate.

When a Taiwanese student gets sick, school administrators can cancel the class. If two students in a school get sick, the school closes down. If a third of the schools in the community are closed, all the schools shut down, according to the action plan.

In the U.S., where students travel from class to class, Wang says, ""If one student gets sick, the virus has rotated everywhere.""

Imposing such stringent measures in the U.S. would be almost impossible, Wang says. The U.S. is vast, geographically, and places public health authority at the state and local level. The federal government must wait for an invitation to launch public health activities at the state level, such as the U.S. Public Health Service ""strike team"" that was dispatched to Seattle last week.

Making matters worse, the U.S. doesn't have a national health insurance plan – and medical insurance plans don't share their records. It would be next to impossible to do the kind of proactive case finding, contact tracing and surveillance in the U.S. that is central to Taiwan's pandemic response.

The U.S. could, however, mount a far more effective response than it has so far. Wang says.

""The United States has enormous capacity. We have more capacity, more talent, and more money than any place in the world,"" he says. ""It's a matter of recognizing that this is a crisis that needs to be dealt with in a speedy, coordinated fashion.""

By Naveen Dewage

2 April 2020

Sri Lankan medical experts have called on government authorities to immediately introduce mass testing for COVID-19 in order to stop community transmissions spreading the virus throughout the country.

Their appeals, which were published in several newspapers this week, came as confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to 146 and fatalities climbed to a total of three. The number of people officially held in quarantine centres is currently about 1,700. Health authorities have placed many villages under isolation and hundreds of people have been asked to home quarantine.

The call for mass testing was issued by University of Colombo Family Medicine faculty chief Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa and publicly endorsed by professors Vajira H.W. Dissanayake, Harendra De Silva and Dr. Ravi P. Rannan-Eliya.

Dr Ruvaiz

“There is a dire need to rapidly increase and expand testing if we want to have a positive impact. The strongest point of our response to the pandemic from a healthcare perspective should be how we can improve our weakest point, which at the moment is testing for COVID-19,” Haniffa said.

Some of those infected may not show symptoms and, because of Sri Lanka’s scandalously low and dangerous testing policies, can go undetected and spread the virus. As of March 29, Sri Lanka had only conducted 2,082 tests. These have revealed 115 infections, an alarming 5.5 percent positive rate.

“If we do not expand testing and identify those with the virus,” Professor Dissanayake observed, “the curfews would be useless.” He also stressed the urgent necessity to protect health workers. When health workers, without prior knowledge and experience and no protective equipment, are exposed to infected patients then they have to be quarantined and cannot work, he warned.

Dissanayake pointed out that longer quarantine periods could be avoided if mass testing was introduced immediately. Several health workers—from the state and private sectors—are currently in quarantine.

Professor De Silva bluntly declared: “We cannot be complacent. We are sitting on the tip of the iceberg… We are not looking out to detect and track cases actively. We are passive: only a selected lot of those seeking treatment are tested. If we do not actively detect the iceberg, it will become a volcano.”

Dr. Rannan-Eliya commented: “More extensive testing means increasing our testing capacity by at least ten-fold so we can test up to 10,000 people a day in an emergency.” Infected people would keep entering Sri Lanka, he said, until “a global solution” was found. “We need to provide ample facilities for people to test and re-test and diagnose COVID-19 cases,” he stated.

Several doctors spoke to the WSWS yesterday, confirming the medical experts’ warnings. They complained about a lack of sufficient ventilators and test kits and pointed to the serious dangers facing medical workers.

Many health workers, the doctors explained, were using hurriedly made and substandard personal protective equipment (PPE), endangering their own lives and those of their patients. These conditions are the result of decades of cuts to health services by consecutive Sri Lankan governments.

While medical experts are calling for mass testing, the Rajapakse administration is mainly concentrating on “social distancing,” “tracing” and its lockdown and curfews. These measures are being enforced by the police and the military.

Colombo, Gampaha, and Kaluthara districts in the Western Province, the Northern Jaffna district, Puttalam in the Northeast and the central Kandy district have all been named as “vulnerable zones” and are under total lockdown. Special Task Force police commandoes are being used for “security” in Colombo where barricades and patrols have been instituted.

The curfew was lifted in several districts for a few hours on Tuesday to allow people to buy essentials, which are, however, becoming scarce. Some of the communities that have been completely isolated include Atalugama village and five villages in Beruwela, in Kalutara district, Akurana in Kandy and the Darawela Tea Estate near Hatton.

The lockdown and curfews are creating enormous hardships for workers, the poor, the self-employed and other sections of society. There are no proper mechanisms for people to buy essentials. The mass of the population is simply ordered to obey government dictates, which are then enforced by the police and the military.

President Gotabhaya Rajapakse has appointed a Special Presidential Task Force, headed by his younger brother Basil Rajapakse. The task force has issued numerous statements about special “relief packages” for the needy. The packages contain a small quantity of dry rations, which are sold to raise money for the poor.

Samurdhi welfare program beneficiaries, who are paid a pittance by the government, have been promised a 10,000 rupee ($US52) payment in April and May. The “payment” is an interest free loan that must be repaid in 18 months.

Workers and elderly people from the Theresa Estate in Bogawanthalawa in the Central Hills waited in line for about eight hours when the curfew was lifted yesterday. They were led to believe that they would be given a charity payment for the elderly and a relief package from the Samurdhi Department. No official turned up and they returned to their estate line room accommodation empty handed.

On Monday it was revealed during a discussion at the Badulla district government administrative office that the distribution of “relief packages” to villages and low-income groups in the municipal area had failed because no essential food items could be obtained.

Remote farmers from Girandurukotte village in Badulla told the WSWS that they have not received any relief. The farmers said that the village officer and local policemen had collected food items from the farmers themselves and distributed them among several families.

About 800 farming families live in Girandurukotte. Many of the village youth have migrated to get work in Sri Lanka’s free trade zones or other jobs in the cities. Following the imposition of the lockdown and the closure of factories they have been forced to return home, but without any way of earning an income.

Last week the curfew required tens of thousands of free trade zone workers to stay inside their boarding houses. As workers’ anger began to mount, the government intervened and sent them back to their villages. The government, however, failed to ensure that the workers were paid last month’s wages and that they continue to receive their pay until the factories reopen.

President Rajapakse is using the coronavirus pandemic to step up the militarisation of his administration. At the same time, in the face of rising discontent, his government is bringing the “opposition” parties on board to assist in the suppression of the inevitable mass resistance to the lack of food and other essentials, including proper healthcare.

On March 24, the United National Party and its splinter group, the Jathika Samagi Balavegaya, along with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the Tamil National Alliance and several Muslim parties, participated in an all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse. All those in attendance pledged their support. The Sri Lankan prime minister has invited these organisations to attend another all-party conference today.

The number of positive cases reported in Sri Lanka so far is 146.

According to the Government Medical Officer’s Association (GMOA), around 80% of the patients infected by SARS_CoV-2 show mild symptoms. “Hence, there is the possibility that they will remain unidentified as carriers of the new coronavirus... those who are in close contact with them too will go undetected unless they start showing symptoms. If tests are carried out, they can be identified early,” the GMOA said in a statement published in the Daily FT.

Sri Lanka’s state-run Medical Research Institute and eight other designated centres are currently conducting COVID-19 tests, according to health officials. So far, nearly 2,500 tests have been conducted in all.

“We are still largely testing only those with suspected symptoms,” Dr. Nalinda Herath of the GMOA, which is also known to be politically influential. “We have conveyed this to the government and hope they will scale up the tests soon,” he told The Hindu.

‘Don’t lift curfew’

The GMOA has also suggested that the government should not lift the curfew — which it has been doing in select districts — pointing to the higher risk of transmission on days when people gather in public places. Sri Lanka has been on a nationwide curfew for over 10 days now, with the government partially lifting it in select districts for a few hours. On Tuesday, health authorities reported 21 cases, the highest number detected since the coronavirus outbreak in Sri Lanka. According to a situation report released by the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, Colombo district has recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country — a total of 32 of the total 146.

Direct-General of Health Services Anil Jasinghe said health authorities were planning to carry out sample testing among those in “high risk groups”. “So far, we have confined testing to those who are in quarantine centres, but we want to get an assessment of the spread of the virus in the community. For this, we plan to start sample testing shortly,” Dr. Jasinghe said, according to media reports.","['2,500 tests']",,,

“We are now conducting tests on people who had maintained contact with the affected patients,” a senior health ministry official, who did not wish to be named, told News1st.

Approximately 150 tests were carried out daily between March 25 and 30, authorities said pointing out that it had been increased upto 300 since March 31.

The country is capable of conducting 1500 PCR tests daily, authorities noted.

However, responding to calls to scale up testing, officials cited lack of resources and funding to make the facility widely available.

But Dr. Anil Jasinghe, the director general of health services said on Monday said that they hope to introduce the rapid test once authorities validate the rapid test kit which can be used to carry out tests effectively.

A PCR test – considered to be highly effective in identifying COVID-19 patients, is carried out at state hospitals using imported test kits, and costs the government Rs 6000 a test.

Private hospitals too were recently permitted to carry out tests under certain regulations.

– Need to carry out more tests

The Government Medical Officers Association, in its latest report on Monday, said “tests need to be carried out on all those who develop symptoms”.

“We should be able to confirm that the 42,000 people who maintained contact with the affected patients are not tested positive for the virus,” the report added.

Health authorities confirmed six deaths due to the coronavirus on Monday with the number of active patients standing at 134, and the number of recoveries at 38.

The medical association urged to carry out tests on before discharging people from quarantine centres.

On Monday, the Sri Lanka Medical Association, Ceylon College of Physicians and Sri Lanka College of Microbiologists requested the government to increase RT-PCR testing capacity to 1,500 tests a day.

Sri Lanka has carried out approximately 3500 tests since a Chinese woman tested positive for the virus in mid-February.

– Cheaper methods

The Department of Molecular Science and Biochemistry at the University of Colombo has designed a kit that could assist in reducing the cost for a PCR test.

“Our product can be given for one fourth of the price (of imported kits). We are offering it for Rs 80,000,” Professor Ranil Dassanayake who led the team which invented the product told News1st.

The new kit will assist in extracting the RNA molecule – which comprises normal human cells and virus cells, from a sample.

The PCR test will determine whether there are virus cells in the RNA molecule.

Prof. Dassanayake stated that the product is being evaluated by the Medical Research Institute as the health ministry has insisted that it should be of a very high standard.","['1,500 tests', '3500 tests', '19 tests', '150 tests']",,,

28 March 2020

More than 100 COVID-19 cases have been reported in Sri Lanka and 255 people are under supervision in 18 hospitals.

Health workers are making a huge effort to treat patients as the number of cases rises daily. The protective gear they need, however, is severely lacking.

As the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on March 3, health workers face “real danger” due to the lack of protective equipment. The WHO statement warned that “without protecting health workers” COVID-19 “cannot be stopped.”

President Gotabhaya Rajapakse’s government, however, has ignored these warnings.

A doctor working at a public hospital told the WSWS: “Personal protective equipment (PPE) like eye masks, face masks and coats required for staff members at out-patient departments, intensive care units (ICUs) and wards for treating diabetes, asthma and fever were severely inadequate even before the pandemic crisis began.”

He added that the shortage has since taken a serious turn. Some hospitals have been forced to produce PPE using substandard materials. “Staff and patients have been put in severe danger by this situation,” he said.

The doctor explained that this state of affairs was not just created by the COVID-19 pandemic. It had developed systematically due to successive governments slashing the health sector. “Now, it has become a crisis.”

“Even the director of the Angoda Infectious Disease Hospital examined patients using a polythene coat made up by doctors themselves, until recently.” If a doctor was infected due to a lack of proper security, “he or she will have to quarantine for 14 days.”

The doctor added: “If large numbers of doctors are forced to quarantine, the situation will become dangerous and other health workers will have an unbearable amount of work.”

Some health workers in the Colombo and Ragama hospitals have been quarantined for infection already.

“Standard PPE equipment must be made available to all the workers, from doctors to minor staff,” the doctor said.

Another public sector doctor told the WSWS: “The time from the 2nd patient to the 50th patient in Sri Lanka was seven days. In Italy it was 24 days. During the first week, 47 patients were reported in Sri Lanka. In Italy, it was three.”

He said the number of patients in the 3rd week in Italy passed 1,000 and all this data pointed to the dire risk of the virus spreading in Sri Lanka. To prevent that, “a proper and sufficient quarantine program is essential and mass testing must be carried out.”

This doctor said the 500 ICU beds in Sri Lankan hospitals were sufficient to treat only 3,000 patients a month. “Even during normal periods, finding an ICU bed for a patient is difficult.”

The available number of ICU beds in Sri Lanka per 100,000 people is just above 2. In Italy, there are 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 but that has proved inadequate. If the pandemic worsens in Sri Lanka, a higher proportion of patients could die than in Italy because they won’t have access to intensive care treatment.

“Considering this situation as an emergency, the number of ICU beds in Sri Lanka should be increased at least five-fold,” the doctor warned.

Explaining the lack of facilities for testing, he said: “A person can be directed to testing only if that person suffers from the symptoms coming within government-provided guidelines.”

The WHO recommendation is to upgrade the facilities so all those suspected of being infected are tested. Following that step, Japan and South Korea was able to reduce the curve of increase of infected patients.

The lack of essential protective gear is a major issue facing nurses and other workers, according to Menaka Priyanthi, the head nursing officer at Ragama Teaching Hospital. She said: “We face such a situation where sewing machines at home have to be brought here and used to sew protective dresses.”

There is deep and growing opposition to the government’s indifference to lack of protective equipment and the severe risk now facing health workers. Seeking to deflect health workers’ anger, the trade unions have issued a series of perfunctory, half-hearted statements about the lack of PPE.

Government Nursing Officers Association president Saman Ratnapriya told a press conference on March 20 that health workers had not yet received a “guideline” outlining steps to control the disease. Two days earlier Government Medical Officers Association secretary Haritha Aluthge complained to reporters that doctors and other health employees at district hospitals were working without masks.

These unions have systematically collaborated with successive Sri Lankan governments to implement health service cuts in line with International Monetary Fund austerity dictates.

The lack of PPE is a real danger facing health workers internationally. In China and Italy, even senior medical officers have died due to COVID-19. Out of the 627 people who died in Italy on March 22, 17 were doctors. And 3,654 Italian health workers have been infected.

These disastrous statistics reveal the utter negligence and unpreparedness of capitalist governments all over the world as public health services have been slashed to transform healthcare into a profit-making enterprise.

The countrywide curfew - imposed last week and due to expire on Monday morning - has now been extended in Colombo, Gampaha, Puttalam, Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mullaitivu, Kilinochchi and Mannar districts until Friday and in all other districts until Thursday, according to a statement by the president's office on Monday.

More:

While Sri Lanka reported its first COVID-19 patient as early as January 27, the country's second case came weeks later on March 11, as the pandemic spread across most parts of the globe.

Since then, the outbreak has also accelerated on the island nation of roughly 21 million, reaching at least 95 cases on Monday, according to the country's health ministry.

Most patients appear to be recent travellers from countries that were some of the worst-hit by the global outbreak of the highly contagious virus, including Italy and South Korea.

At least 3,506 people, including 31 foreigners from 14 countries, remain quarantined in 45 centres across the country, according to the National Operation Centre for Prevention of COVID-19 Outbreak.

""There is fear that the numbers could rise up as some of the returnees from COVID-19-hit countries escaped from quarantine process,"" said Ananda Wijewickrama, consultant at Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in capital Colombo.

Earlier, police imposed a curfew in Puttalam district and several areas of the Western Province amid claims that people who escaped the quarantine process had gone to their homes in those areas.

Following the imposition of the countrywide curfew on Friday, people across the country were reported to be rushing to stores to buy essential supplies and medicine.

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, however, assured citizens in a televised address on Friday that there were adequate stocks of basic necessities.

""We are able to provide you the daily needs. We have adequate stock of medicine, food, drinks and fuel for months,"" he said.

Earlier, his brother and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered a reduction in the prices of certain essential commodities in order to aid the public during the crisis.

Expanding facilities

Doctors fear they do not have enough resources to deal with a large-scale outbreak. So far, all patients who test positive for COVID-19 are being treated at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Colombo.

""We are expanding the ICU by converting a section of the hospital into it,"" said Wijewickrama. ""The air force is building a small building within the hospital premises. They will complete the work within three [or] four days.""

To check the spread of COVID-19, the Sri Lankan government has closed all international commercial flights into the country until at least March 25. A mandatory 14-day quarantine process is in place for those who have returned from countries where large-scale COVID-19 outbreak has been detected.

The imposition of a curfew was aimed at promoting social distancing, which the World Health Organization has recommended to curb the spread of the virus.

Authorities are strictly enforcing the curfew, with at least 2,000 people arrested for violating it over the weekend, according to the Sri Lankan police.

Compared with its densely populated South Asian neighbours, Sri Lanka has a better health infrastructure, with 2.38 ICU beds per 100,000 people, according to Dr Naveen De Soysa, assistant secretary of the Government Medical Officers' Association.

""When we compare COVID-19 situation in Sri Lanka with Italy, we can say that Sri Lanka is capable of stopping the spread,"" he said, as he lauded the government's decision to impose curfew early in the outbreak to curb the spread of the virus.

China is supporting the Sri Lankan government's efforts, with a $500m loan extended last week to help fight the virus, according to a statement issued by the Chinese foreign ministry.

Impact on tourism

Sri Lanka significantly depends on tourism, which makes up nearly 5 percent of its $87bn GDP. Those in the tourism industry fear the global downturn in travel could affect the island nation disproportionately.

The tourism sector in Sri Lanka provides direct or indirect employment to at least 500,000 people, according to a hotel owners' group.

""The tourism sector provides a significant amount of jobs to Sri Lankans ... More than two million people depend on income from tourism,"" said Sanath Ukwatte, president of the Hotel Association of Sri Lanka.

Tourism has been down since the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, which targeted luxury hotels and Christian churches, killing more than 250 people.

In January this year, Ukwatte had said Sri Lanka's tourism industry was recovering. Today, however, only about 10,000 tourists remain in the country, he said.",,,['38 ICU beds'],

Here, a Malian researcher holds a sample to be tested at a research center in Bamako (AFP Photo/MICHELE CATTANI)

Bamako (AFP) - At a seven-bed isolation centre in Mali's capital Bamako, medical staff are scrambling to prepare for an outbreak of the new coronavirus.

Although no cases have yet been declared in the war-torn country, health authorities are bracing for an onslaught of patients with few resources to accommodate them.

According to an official document consulted by AFP in mid-March, the impoverished Sahel country has just a single ventilator -- the crucial equipment for dealing with respiratory failure -- although the health ministry later said the figure is 56 machines.

""We are preparing for the worst,"" conceded Prime Minister Boubou Cisse on Thursday. ""The means we have do not allow us to be behind every Malian.""

Just 20 or so isolation beds are available across the country, according to Cisse, a figure that the ministry later said was 37.

The World Health Organization has called on the African continent to ""wake up"", after the first death in sub-Saharan Africa from the pandemic was announced on Wednesday in Burkina Faso, which borders Mali.

Millions of people could die from the new coronavirus, particularly in poor countries, if it is allowed to spread unchecked, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday, appealing for a coordinated global response.

""Global solidarity is not only a moral imperative, it is in everyone's interests,"" he said.

In Bamako, Dr Ilo Bella Diall said he did what he could to prepare as soon as the epidemic began to spread outside China. The director of Point G University Hospital had unused hospital buildings converted for isolating COVID-19 patients.

""We are preparing for all possible scenarios,"" he said.

But according to the Ministry of Health, Mali has only 600 litres of hydro-alcoholic gel despite a need for 500,000 litres, and 59 medical infrared thermometers, well short of the 20,000 needed. The country has only 2,000 test kits and no suitable thermal cameras to detect fevers.

- War on two fronts -

This vast country in the Sahel has already been grappling with a war for eight years: first against independence movements in 2012, then against a jihadist insurgency that has spread from northern Mali to its centre, as well as to Niger and Burkina Faso on its southern border.

The fighting has caused thousands of civilian and military deaths. On Thursday, the army said around 30 Malian soldiers were killed and five more injured in a suspected jihadist attack.

""Today, added to our classic challenges is that of succeeding in the war against the coronavirus,"" President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said on Tuesday at a Defence Council meeting.

The war is mostly one of awareness. Fear of the coronavirus has not yet taken hold in Bamako: tea glasses are still being shared and hands are still being shaken.

In buses and taxis, customers still huddle together. It is only in the upper echelons of power that people greet each other with an elbow.

""We have to communicate so that Malians become aware of the magnitude of the pandemic,"" said Seydou Doumbia, dean of the medical school in Bamako where 143 tests of the virus -- all negative -- had been carried out as of last Thursday.

The option of confinement has so far been ruled out in a country whose economy is heavily dependent on the informal sector, with the majority of the population earning a meagre day-to-day living.

The government has, however, suspended flights from affected countries and closed schools in a bid to prevent the spread of the virus.

- Health systems not ready -





At the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Doumbia runs Mali's only laboratory meeting the required biosafety standards to study the new disease.

In the confined enclaves of the laboratory, built and maintained with American funding, 13 researchers tirelessly analyse samples.

""Yesterday, we finished at midnight. Imagine when we get the first case,"" says one researcher, Amadou Kone. Three other laboratories, on a lower level, are planned to supplement this one if necessary.

""Our health systems are not ready,"" acknowledged the minister of health, Michel Sidibe, former head of UNAIDS.

Mali, ranked 184th out of 189 on the UN Human Development Index, has made a plea to its financial partners to release funds. Some $30-35 million will be given or lent to Bamako to fight against the virus in ""the days and weeks to come,"" according to the government.

At Point G University Hospital, the money will be most welcome.

""If we have the means, we'll be able to start work very quickly and increase our reception capacity,"" says a hospital official.","['143 tests', '2,000 test kits']",,,

The Malian government on Monday said it had many times more ventilators available for dealing with coronavirus than an official document indicated.

An internal health ministry document entitled ""Action Plan for Preventing and Responding to Covid-19,"" which AFP consulted in mid-March, suggested that there was just a single ventilator in the entire country.

READ | Mali panics over coronavirus

In a statement to AFP, the health ministry said 41 ventilators were available in public hospitals and 15 in private facilities in Bamako, and ""all are operational.""

The landlocked Sahel country has not recorded any case of the new virus, but its poverty, poor medical infrastructure and conflict are conditions that experts say badly heighten vulnerability to contagious disease.

On Thursday, Prime Minister Boubou Cisse said ""we are preparing for the worst"" and cautioned, ""the means at our disposal do not enable us to be behind every Malian.""

Romania,,https://www.romania-insider.com/coronavirus-romaia-doctors-protective-equipment-tests,"Coronavirus in Romania: Doctors complain about lack of protection equipment, Covid-19 tests","Coronavirus in Romania: Doctors complain about lack of protection equipment, Covid-19 tests

Romanian doctors complain about the lack of protection equipment and Covid-19 tests in local hospitals and warn that the number of people infected with the new coronavirus could be higher than the one officially announced by the authorities.

A gynecologist at a hospital in Iasi wrote on Facebook about her experience performing a C-section on a patient that had been in contact with a person who had returned from Italy 18 days ago and was not tested for Covid-19 although she asked for a test. She says the doctors and nurses who performed the operation had only minimum protection equipment (surgery masks, gloves, and the sterile gown) and that they didn’t have a Covid-19 test kit to test the patient.

Here is her post:

“I am on duty today with some colleagues!

I am informed that a pregnant woman will arrive in the hospital, with a triggered birth and that she got in touch (visit) a week ago with a relative of hers, who arrived from Veneto 18 days ago!

I'm gone!

The indication is to complete the birth through Caesarean section!

The agitation begins! Where do we see her? ... We blocked an examination office for her, a cabinet in which the disinfection was later performed!

Do we have protective equipment? ... No, we don’t!!!

Do we have tests for harvesting and sending to infectious diseases? ... No, we don’t!!!

But, what do we have?

Doctors and nurses who have to enter the room and possibly become infected? ... yes, that's what we have! 🤬

Only with 2 rows of masks, 2 rows of gloves and the sterile dressing gown!

God have mercy!

It's not normal for this to happen!

It is not normal to NOT have protective equipment!

It is not normal to put a whole hospital at risk!

In these conditions of practicing medicine in pandemic conditions, Romania will surpass other European states for the number of cases!

Why do we (still) have few cases? ... because people are NOT tested!

It is a false truth exposed to the public!

Romanian state, you are required to purchase tests, disinfectants and protective materials!

Health is guaranteed by the Constitution!

How was it guaranteed to us, to those on duty today?

And the duty continues.....”

The situation is similar in many hospitals in Romania, where the doctors, who are expected to treat people, are the most exposed to the Covid-19 infection due to lack of equipment.

Here’s what a pulmonologist at the Marius Nasta Hospital in Bucharest says when asked about a Digi24 reporter about the protection equipment available in the hospital:

“We, our skin, a sufficient natural barrier, our nasal and oral mucosa, a sufficient barrier, the hospital clothes, over which a clothespin can be placed.”

Reporter: “So you don’t have any equipment actually…”

Doctor: “We don’t... No measure is certain. A friend from Italy told me that about 20% of the hospital personnel despite wearing diving equipment, completely sealed. I had heard from someone in the field that 40% of global medical staff has become infected. They got infected, but at least they took the measures that need to be taken. What if you don't take those either? Should we expect that as much as 90% of the medical staff gets infected? Doctors are more exposed, repeatedly. Our immunity exists, but at one point it says: Excuse me, I went to bed. What will happen when 60-70% of the medical personnel is infected?”

After 1,952 Covid-19 cases were confirmed in Romania on March 30 (13:00), the country is preparing to enter the fourth scenario of the coronavirus epidemic, when the threshold of 2,000 cases is exceeded.

Almost 1,500 mechanical ventilators, essential devices for Covid-19 patients in critical condition, are available in intensive care units in Romania, health minister Nelu Tătaru told G4Media.ro on Monday, March 30.

At the same time, the authorities are currently undertaking the purchase of another 2,000 ventilators, he told G4media.ro. However, their delivery depends on finding the providers, the restrictions imposed by the governments of the exporting countries, and the existing manufacturing capacity.

At a potential epidemic peak of 10,000 Covid-19 patients, critical cases account for 10% of the total. If the peak does not come suddenly, the support capacity offered by the existing ventilators will not be exceeded, Tătaru said.

The health minister explained that, in addition to mechanical ventilators, doctors can use the existing anesthesia machines and monitored beds.

According to data from the National Public Health Institute quoted by G4media.ro, hospitals reported having 2,816 mechanical ventilators, 1,987 anesthesia machines, and 7,670 monitors. However, not all of the equipment is in use, medical sources explained.

With a population of in between 19 and 19.5 people at the beginning of 2019, according to data from the National Statics Institute, Romania has around 7 (7.7 – 7.8) ventilators per 100,000 people.

If all the reported 2,816 ventilators were in use, then around 14 (14.3 – 14.7) devices would be available per 100,000 people.

On Friday, March 27, Alexandru Rafila, the president of the Romanian Microbiology Society, said that he was most worried about the capacity of the intensive care units because a mechanical ventilator is used for three weeks, on average, on a patient, while Romania has 1,300 such devices.

Countries everywhere are looking to buy more ventilators as hospitals face shortages of equipment because of the large number of Covid-19 patients needing treatment. In mid-March, Germany was looking to buy 10,000 such devices, while Italy 5,000, Reuters reported.

In Romania, the project of a locally-designed ventilator, developed in Timişoara, is going into testing phase this week. Meanwhile, the Romanian companies in the automotive industry have formed a group with the aim of starting production of medical mechanical ventilators, economy minister Virgil Popescu announced.

“A commercial guerrilla fight” is ongoing over the medical supplies needed to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, Ionel Dancă, the head of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, said in a Facebook post.

The fight is one “against the clock for every quantity of masks, protective gear, PCR tests, mechanical ventilator and other medical equipment” and “all possible political and diplomatic resources” are used in it, he said.

“Several tonnes of sanitary supplies and medical equipment reached Romania over the past weeks and several others are being brought in following huge efforts. We have started this war with the virus empty-handed, with no stocks of medical supplies for the risks of an epidemic and, within just a few weeks, we have done everything humanly possible to get the healthcare system ready for this fight,” he wrote.

Dancă spoke of international acquisition contracts canceled without hesitation at the first higher counter-offer.

“The entire process of acquiring, contracting, transporting, delivering, and distributing the sanitary and medical supplies needed at this time has received the connotations of an international war for limited resources. There have been unprecedented situations, when firm international acquisitions contracts were canceled without hesitation, with the return of the down payments, at the first higher counter-offer. Other contracts, in the process of being delivered, got stuck after national decisions to ban exports,” he explained.

He also said that ensuring transport and flight corridors has become more difficult at this time than ensuring humanitarian aid convoys pass through armed conflict zones.

Dancă said that every county in Romania will have real-time PCR machines soon.

“There are 1,600 mechanical ventilators available for critical patients, and we are making efforts to bring another 200 to Romania in the coming days. At the same time, we are preparing the local production as well. Moreover, through Unifarm, the National Office for Centralized Acquisitions (ONAC) or the Red Cross, over 2 million masks and almost 800,000 protective suits have arrived in the country and another 14 million FFP2/3 masks will be delivered in April. We have prepared the local production for 15 million masks per month. Even so, with all these efforts, the threat from the virus continues to be high and we can never say that we have everything we need to cope with the worst,” Dancă also wrote.

On Saturday, April 4, PM Ludovic Orban said there are contracts with various suppliers for the delivery of 400 ventilators to Romania but the delivery schedule was not being followed. Solutions were being identified for the start of the local production, Agerpres reported.

“We have contracts for 400 ventilators. Unfortunately, the delivery schedule that we established is not followed because of decisions by governments or presidents of various exporting countries that blocked the exit of the equipment from the country,” Orban said.

The PM said the authorities were also looking at repairing the existing, broken ventilators and thus make available another 80-100 such devices.

Orban explained that the Defense Ministry was also working on the project of a ventilator.

“The Defense Ministry is working on the project of a ventilator. […] I hope we are able to test it as soon as possible. We need to identify production capacities for the components: the ventilation equipment, the monitor and all the other devices used are very sensitive; the patients’ lives depend on them and they include very many parts that need to be manufactured in the best conditions,” Orban said.

Romania,,https://www.romania-insider.com/coronavirus-fundraising-campaigns-romania,"Lending a helping hand: Romanian NGOs, individuals are raising donations for fight against coronavirus","Lending a helping hand: Romanian NGOs, individuals are raising donations for fight against coronavirus

Many non-profit organizations, associations, foundations or even individuals in Romania have been raising funds for the local healthcare system or vulnerable communities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Most are raising money for protective equipment or other materials the healthcare workers need to fight the pandemic, but some have even bigger plans, such as building a modular hospital for coronavirus patients. Below is a list of such campaigns and initiatives (and everyone is welcome to join their efforts).

The Romanian Red Cross has launched the national fundraising campaign “Romania saves Romania” aimed at raising donations to help local hospitals and the medical staff fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The NGO will use the collected funds to provide medical equipment and materials to hospitals, but also for assistance with food and hygiene packages for vulnerable persons in isolation at home, as well to provide assistance to quarantine centers in the country. Everyone can donate EUR 2 for this campaign via text message at 8827, or online here.

Daruieste Viata, which is currently building a hospital in Bucharest through private donations, also announced that all the donations collected starting March 11 would be directed to the fight against coronavirus and to supporting the healthcare system. Thus, the NGO has been raising money for protective and medical equipment that are then donated to hospitals and health workers, but also for a much ambitious project – a modular hospital for COVID-19 patients, which is currently being built next to the Elias Hospital in Bucharest. Donations can be made online here.

Zi de Bine Association also decided to change its original concept of supporting one cause per month for 12 months and join the fight against coronavirus instead. Thus, the association has been collecting money for tests, disinfectants, protective equipment for doctors, medical beds, intubation kits, mechanical ventilation equipment, and other much-needed equipment. Those who want to help can send an SMS at 8862 with the message ‘SUS’ (one text message equals a donation of EUR 4). Donations can also be made by bank transfer or PayPal. Further details are available here. The NGO also announced that is has joined the initiative of French retailers Auchan and Leroy Merlin, which have started setting up a hospitalization center for non-critical COVID-19 patients, in the Bucharest-Ilfov area.

UNICEF Romania also started a fundraising campaign aimed at raising donations that would be used to buy protective equipment for professionals in the field of social and healthcare services, which are essential for vulnerable children in Romania and their families. Donations can be made by SMS at 8844 with the text message “COPIL” or online here.

Save the Children Romania opened an emergency fund for the immediate support of the local healthcare system. The donations collected so far have been used to buy medical equipment and materials hospitals and healthcare workers need to treat COVID-19 patients. But medical facilities across the country still need help. Donations can be made online here (where those interested can also find more information).

The Magic Association also opened an emergency fund for hospitals, with the same aim: to help medical facilities and doctors fight the novel coronavirus pandemic in Romania by providing them with protective materials, supplies, hospital equipment and whatever else is needed to cross this critical period. Donations can be made online here and here.

Banca Transilvania, Mobexpert, Bitdefender and eMAG have launched the platform „Donează pentru linia întâi” (Donate for the front line) to help doctors and healthcare staff treating COVID-19 patients, but also the Police, Army or Gendarmerie, which are present on the streets every day. Together, the four companies have donated RON 4 million so far and have been involved in the procurement and distribution process, and in the organization of the donation platform. Those interested can make donations online or by bank transfers, all details are available here.

Ajutati Salvarea (Help the Ambulance), a project launched at the end of March by two Bucharesters, both workers at the Bucharest-Ilfov Ambulance Service, has been raising donations for the purchase of protective equipment and biocides for ambulance workers. Further details are available here.

The Margareta of Romania Royal Foundation has initiated a special fund aimed at helping the elderly affected by the coronavirus crisis and the isolation caused by this pandemic. Those who want to donate can do it online here, or they can send an SMS with the text “SINGUR” at 8844. Further details about this initiative are available here.

The organizers of major festivals and events in Cluj-Napoca have put up for sale “solidarity tickets,” in an attempt to help the local authorities equip hospitals with all the materials they need to fight COVID-19. About 60 events, civic organizations, companies, universities and public administration institutions from Cluj county have joined the project. Further details are available here, and donations can be made here.

Inima Copiilor is trying to raise EUR 40,000 to buy an advanced neonatal ventilator for the Municipal Hospital in Oradea. Those who want to help can find more information here.

Local NGO Uniti pentru Viata (United for Life) is also collecting donations for the hospital in Targu Neamt. The funds will be used for medical and protective equipment. Further details here.

At the same time, Maria Holtzhauser Association is raising funds to equip the hospital in Falticeni. Those who want to help can send a SMS at 8837 with the message “Falticeni.” More details are available here.

Bogdan Tanasa, a local entrepreneur and fundraiser, whose association Casa Share has been building houses for poor families for several years, has also been raising funds to buy medical and protective equipment and supplies for the hospitals in the Moldova region. For example, in late-March, he has delivered an automated machine that processes Covid-19 tests to the Saint Parascheva Infectious Diseases Hospital in Iasi. At the same time, Bogdan continued to help the needy with food and personal hygiene products, while also working on a new house for a poor family. Further details on how to help Bogdan Tanasa with his social projects are available here.

Also in Moldova, local entrepreneur Stefan Mandachi, who became famous after building the first meter of highway in Moldova region to protest the poor infrastructure in this part of the country, has started raising funds for Red Cross Suceava. In this sense, he is now selling his “one-meter highway”, asking EUR 10 for every cm of road. Thus, everyone who donates EUR 10 will become the owner of 1 cm of the highway. Donations and further information are available at 1cm.ro.

Marius Simionica, founder of the “Marius si Prietenii” Charity Foundation, also joined the fight against the new coronavirus and has been raising funds to buy medical supplies and equipment for hospitals. Further details here.

“Everything is done on the cheap,” protests the staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

It’s a complaint echoed in other parts of the country, where doctors and nurses have begun speaking out about what they say are life-threatening shortcomings in the fight against the new coronavirus.

Feeling ill-equipped and scared, some have taken to social media or public TV to voice their concerns; dozens staged protests in the grounds of two hospitals.

Several felt so strongly that they resigned, leaving an already struggling healthcare system in one of the European Union’s poorest countries even more vulnerable.

“Nobody instructed us so we’re encouraged to learn from videos,” the Râmnicu Sărat medical staff member told AFP.

“We were promised equipment, but when will it arrive?”

Hospitals become weak link in Romania as virus death toll rises https://t.co/nB4xWXasQR — MSN International Edition (@msnintl) April 2, 2020

The hospital has been placed on a long list of “support units” selected to receive patients who have tested positive for COVID-19.

But the move has sparked fear among local residents that the virus could spread in the area and an online petition has been launched.

‘Lack of trust’

Since 2007 when Romania joined the EU, more than 14,000 healthcare workers have emigrated in search of better pay and conditions abroad.

On Monday alone (30 March), 10 nurses and one intensive care unit (ICU) medic from central Hunedoara county quit, blaming a chronic lack of basic medical equipment such as surgical masks and gloves.

A day later, the nurses — but not the doctor — were persuaded by officials to change their minds and go back to work.

“We have two medical gowns for 12 employees…,” the doctor, Lorena Ehim, told local media, adding they were being forced to face the virus and risk their health “with bare hands”.

At a hospital in the western city of Timișoara, 13 medical staffers resigned on Tuesday, according to local media.

“I can understand my colleagues who step down, but I don’t encourage resignation,” Gheorghe Borcean, president of Romania’s medical association, told AFP.

“Even more than fear (of infection), there is a lack of trust in the medical system,” he said.

Romania, as of Wednesday, had confirmed more than 2,450 cases of COVID-19 — about 300 of them medical workers — and 86 deaths.

The government has promised to get more protective gear for medical staff.

It also considered banning resignations but decided against, fearing such a move would fuel more resentment.

“We’re looking at you with hope. The coming days will be even tougher, but we’ll do our best to give you protective gear,” President Klaus Iohannis told medical staff on Tuesday in a press statement.

Hospital as hotspot

Doctors are also critical of the state of ICU units, which risk being overwhelmed soon in a country of 19 million people, with the outbreak expected to peak in the middle of this month.

On paper, Romania has 5,111 ICU beds, but fewer than half of those are equipped with a ventilator, according to Health Minister Nelu Tataru.

For the past three decades, the system has been plagued by widespread corruption and a lack of investment.

Romania spends just over five percent of its gross domestic product on health care, the lowest ratio in the EU, according to Eurostat data.

Sfantul Ioan Emergency Hospital in the northeastern city of Suceava has become the centre of the country’s coronavirus outbreak.

The hospital was forced to close after dozens of staff members became infected.

Prosecutors have opened an investigation on suspicions that “measures taken to prevent and limit the spread of the novel coronavirus weren’t respected”.

But Sfantul Ioan hospital doctor Mircea Dinu Bordiniuc said on RFI Romania radio that not all medical personnel were tested.

“It’s an error of public health to ask medical personnel, who should have been in isolation, to go to work,” he said.

Suceava and its surrounding region, close to the Ukrainian border, has seen around 400 coronavirus cases, half of which involve doctors and nurses.

Some 30 people infected with the virus have died.

Romania is the first EU country that volunteered to purchase and host, on behalf of the European Union, a stockpile of ventilators, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told the public television TVR.

A total of 150 ventilators have already been ordered and will reach Romania before being sent to countries that need them, including Spain and in Italy.

On March 19, the European Commission announced it was creating a strategic stockpile of medical equipment, such as ventilators and protective masks, to help EU countries in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. The stockpile is to include items such as intensive care medical equipment like ventilators; personal protective equipment such as reusable masks, vaccines and therapeutics; and laboratory supplies.

The stockpile would be hosted by one or several member states, the Commission said at the time. The hosting state is responsible for procuring the equipment.

The Commission finances 90% of the stockpile. The Emergency Response Coordination Center manages the distribution of the equipment to ensure it goes where it is needed most.

“We have created a common strategic stockpile of medical equipment of the EU. It is the first time we manage to do this, through the civil protection mechanism, rescEU. We will purchase these supplies with EU money, and send them to the countries that need them most. I am proud and grateful that Romania offered to be the first European country to purchase and host, on behalf of the EU, ventilators. [A total of] 150 ventilators have already been ordered and will reach Romania immediately to be able to send them to countries that need them, of course in Spain and in Italy,” von der Leyen told TVR.

In the same interview with TVR, the president of the European Commission highlighted Romania’s initiative to send a team of doctors and nurses to Italy. “I think this is European solidarity: solidaritate europeană,” she said.

April 7: Malawi records death, Infected mothers deliver in Cameroon, Uganda

Malawi’s coronavirus tally has reached eight with the Ministry of Health confirming the first casualty in the southern African nation.

The patient was a 51-year-old Malawian woman of Indian origin who had recently returned to the country from the UK. The ministry said she had an underlying heath condition.

Of the three new cases announced today, two of the patients are in the city of Blantyre and the other in Chikwawa town. Malawi was one of the African countries that recorded a case very late. So far only Comoros and Lesotho have yet to be infected.

Infected women deliver in Cameroon, Uganda

The BBC reports that a patient undergoing treatment for coronavirus in the Cameroon’s capital, Yaoundé, gave birth to a baby girl over the weekend, quoting a doctor at the hospital’s isolation ward.

The mother, 19-year-old Marie, gave birth normally but has since been separated from her newborn baby. The patient was connected to an oxygen supply when her contractions started, the report added.

“We just arranged the room and she delivered on her bed while on oxygen,” Dr Yaneu Ngaha Bondja Junie, a gynaecologist at the hospital, told the BBC.

The baby was born prematurely weighing 2.1kg (4.6lb) and is in the neonatal unit. It is not clear if the baby is infected as her tests are still being processed, but she is being fed with breast milk from her mother.

It is the second known birth of a child by a COVID-19 patient. Over the weekend, portals in Uganda confirmed the birth through Caesarean section of a healthy baby.

The Daily Monitor report gave the following details. The 22-year-old Ugandan mother gave birth to a healthy baby girl at Entebbe Grade B Hospital. She was reportedly infected by her husband who returned from Dubai recently.

“The patient gave birth very well this afternoon through a Caesarean Section and the mother and baby are in good health,” Dr Moses Muwonge, the director of the hospital is quoted to have said.

A statement from the prime minister’s office confirmed that other officials who agreed to forgo their salaries are leaders of national institutions and top government officials. The country has 105 confirmed cases with four recoveries. It is East Africa’s third most impacted behind Mauritius and Kenya.

A strictly enforced lockdown remains in place having been extended last week by the cabinet. The government has since last week been distributing food to citizens who had been relying on receiving pay every day.

Lawmakers in Nigeria weeks back agreed to forgo their salaries as contributions towards the COVID-19 fight. Kenya’s president and top government officials also took salary cuts for the same reason.

Over in Malawi, President Peter Mutharika also announced taking a 10% salary cut along with his ministers. “The coronavirus attack has a huge negative impact on the economy and businesses everywhere.

“There are many business people and industry players who are uncertain about the situation as it is unfolding. I know that everyone is worried,” he said.

“Therefore, government will take measures to protect jobs and incomes, protect businesses and ensure continuity of the supply chain and the survival of the economy.”

Amongst other measures, the president directed the Reserve Bank of Malawi to allow banks to offer a three-month moratorium on interest payments on loans to small- and medium-sized businesses.

He also ordered the country’s Competition and Fair Trading Commission to put in place strict monitoring of price controls and punish anyone found increasing prices at the expense of Malawians.

April 5: South Sudan index case

South Sudan has announced its first case of COVID-19, making it the 51st of Africa’s 54 countries to report the disease.

A U.N. worker who arrived in the country from Netherlands on Feb. 28 is ill with the disease, confirmed First Vice President Riek Machar and the U.N. mission in South Sudan. The patient, a 29-year-old woman, first showed signs of the disease on April 2 and is recovering, said officials.

South Sudan, with 11 million people, currently has four ventilators and wants to increase that number, said Machar, who emphasized that people should stay three to six feet apart from others. “The only vaccine is social distancing,” said Machar.

The patient is under quarantine at U.N. premises and health workers are tracing the people who had been in contact with her, said David Shearer, head of the U.N. operations in South Sudan. He said he hoped the measures would contain the case.

To prevent the spread of the virus in South Sudan, President Salva Kiir last week imposed a curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. for six weeks and closed borders, airports, schools, churches and mosques.

The same day, neighboring Kazakhstan declared a state of emergency as authorities announced that three new cases had been recorded, pushing the total number there to nine.

Kazakhstan was thought to have been coronavirus-free until four infections were confirmed on March 13. The state of emergency announced by presidential decree imposes a nationwide quarantine and will restrict both entry to and departure from the country to all except diplomats and individuals invited by the government.

Kazakhstan had already announced the cancelation of Norouz holiday celebrations and a military parade devoted to the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.

Officials there previously said more than 1,000 people were in quarantine and nearly 500 others in self-quarantine at home.

Uzbekistan announced similar sweeping measures on March 15, barring entry for all foreigners and departures by locals.

The Uzbek government also closed schools and universities for three weeks, canceled all public events, and suspended international air and highway connections beginning March 16.

Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are the only Central Asian republics to have officially registered any cases of the new coronavirus at the center of a global pandemic.

Iranian Deaths Top 700

Meanwhile, in Iran, as the number of fatalities attributed to COVID-19 topped 700, the official handling the response to the pandemic warned that the country's health facilities could soon be overwhelmed.



“If the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,” the state-run IRNA news agency quoted Ali Reza Zali as saying on March 15.

The country has reported that nearly 14,000 people are infected, behind only China and Italy.

Iran reportedly has around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in Tehran, and has said it will set up mobile clinics. Critics fear the real number of COVID-19 infections could be much higher as questions swirl over the government's transparency with regard to the issue.

Interactive: The Symptoms Of COVID-19

Zali said that many of those who died were otherwise healthy, while Iran's Health Ministry published statistics showing that 55 percent of those who died were in their 60s, but 15 percent were younger than 40.

Iranian Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference that people ""should cancel all travel and stay at home so that we may see the situation improving in the coming days.""

Clerical rulers in Iran have closed schools and universities and suspended religious, cultural, and sports events across the country to combat the outbreak, and the country has sought a $5-billion emergency loan from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help finance the effort.

Trump Negative For Coronavirus

Countries around the world continued to introduce new measures in an effort to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Research Center, which combines WHO figures and local media reports, put the precise number of COVID-19 infections around the world at 162,627 as of March 15, with 6,065 deaths. It shows 75,620 patients have recovered after testing positive for the virus.

A Reuters tally put the numbers at 162,365 people infected and 6,070 dead. It put the number of those recovered at 75,871.

Across Europe, which was recently identified by the World Health Organization as the epicenter of the pandemic that emerged in China in December 2019, many states were restricting limits on day-to-day movements and international travel in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus.

Despite taking similar measures, France was going forward with local elections on March 15, arguing that the vote was essential to democratic continuity.

In the United States, a travel ban on flights from 26 European states that has caused chaos at airports was being extended to include the United Kingdom and Ireland.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tested negative for the coronavirus, the White House physician has said.

""This evening, I received confirmation that the test is negative,"" Sean Conley, the president's physician said in a statement on March 14.

""One week after having dinner with the Brazilian delegation at Mar-a-Lago, the president remains symptom-free,"" he said, referring to Trump’s Florida resort.

In China, authorities continued to record lower numbers of domestic infections, but were imposing new checks on international travelers after 16 new imported cases were reported on March 14.

In Russia, four new cases of COVID-19 infection were announced on March 15, bringing the total there to 63.

Rail service between Russia and Ukraine, Moldova, and Latvia will be suspended as of March 17, according to a subsidiary of Russian Railways.

Armenia shut down the city of Vagharshapat, west of the capital, Yerevan, in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said on March 15.

Eighteen coronavirus cases out of 28 registered in Armenia were reported from Vagharshapat, also known as Echmiadzin. The city has a population of 46,000 people.

Pashinian said the local residents will be able to leave the city only after having their body temperature taken.

Italy, the hardest-hit country in Europe with more than 1,800 fatalities, recorded 368 new deaths on March 15, the country’s civil-protection authority said.

The Vatican announced that Pope Francis will not lead any public Easter celebrations.

Britain, which had resisted major restrictions, was reportedly preparing to ban large gatherings.

The pandemic has roiled world financial markets and prompted many governments to pledge spending packages to try to limit economic effects.

‘‘The defense industry enterprises have been mobilized for nationwide measures aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus,’’ reads a statement issued by Kazakhstan' Industry and Infrastructure Development Ministry on Friday.

‘‘As part of the technical conversion, defense factories have promptly switched to the production of civilian goods for general and medical purposes.’’

This week, the defense industry complex ""Kazakhstan Engineering"" began converting one of its aerospace plants in northern Kazakhstan to start making about two million masks. In addition, the plant, which now operates around the clock — three shifts a day, will manufacture portable ventilators for ambulances. The two other defense manufacturers, both located in Almaty, have pledged their support to make hazmat suits and sanitizers, while some defense factories have shifted manufacturing towards infrared thermometers and safety equipment.

At the same time, defense manufacturers in Kazakhstan have not halted the main production.

‘‘They are working to implement the state defense order for 2020 to meet requirements of law enforcement agencies within the approved schedule,’’ the ministry’s statement reads.

On Friday, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called on industry and governments to increase the manufacturing of personal protective equipment by 40 percent to meet rising global demand.

""Industry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can’t stop COVID-19 without protecting health workers first,” said WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, according to a statement published to the organization’s website.

Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, prices for personal medical supplies have surged. Surgical masks have seen a sixfold increase, while N95 respirators have trebled and gowns have doubled. Shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other frontline workers dangerously ill-equipped to care for coronavirus patients.

According to the WHO data, an estimated 89 million medical masks are required for the COVID-19 response each month. For examination gloves, that figure goes up to 76 million, while international demand for goggles stands at 1.6 million per month.

The World Bank said on Friday it had allocated $10 million to address Kazakhstan’s urgent need for medical equipment and supplies, especially for ventilators. The next loan in the amount of $25 million will be allocated in the near future, according to Jean-François Marteau, the country manager of the World Bank for Kazakhstan.

On Thursday, a commercial aircraft carrying 500 kilograms of tests, gloves, gowns and other medical supplies from China touched down in Almaty.

The rapidly spreading COVID-19 virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has already infected more than one million people and killed more than 58,000 across the world since last December, according to an interactive map from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering.

QUITO, Ecuador — Daniel Larrea died Monday after a week of high fever, struggling to breathe and steadily turning blue. Then a new nightmare began for his family. No one in their city on Ecuador’s Pacific coast would pick up his body.

“We wrapped him up in black plastic,” Larrea’s wife, Karina, said Wednesday. “He’s here in the living room.”

Hospitals are turning away patients and bodies are being left on streets and in homes for days in Guayaquil, a normally bustling city of 2.6 million that has become a hot spot in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic spreads.

The small South American nation has recorded 120 coronavirus deaths, but officials say there could be dozens more who died without ever being officially diagnosed — people like Larrea, who had all the symptoms, but never got tested. Nationwide, there were 3,160 cases confirmed on Thursday, likely a vast underestimate.

Meanwhile, untold numbers of Ecuadorians are dying of unrelated diseases that can’t be treated because hospitals are overwhelmed.

It’s not just medical services at a breaking point. Morgues, funeral homes and all related services for the dead are over capacity.

In recent days, macabre images and pleas from families have appeared on social media showing dead loved ones wrapped in plastic or cloth, waiting for them to be taken away. Television crews have captured images of bodies and coffins left on sidewalks.

“It’s a desperate smell,” said Merwin Teran, 61, the owner of a Guayaquil funeral home, who said he saw 50 dead in one morgue alone.

Doctors say there aren’t enough tests in the country, making it harder to identify and isolate the sick to try to stop the spread of COVID-19, the disease the virus causes — as well as too few hospital beds and ventilators.

“We are seeing a situation quite similar to that of Italy,” said Dr. Mireya Rodas, a lung specialist at a Guayaquil hospital who has herself tested positive.

Ecuador identified its first case of COVID-19 on Feb. 29 — a 71-year-old woman who had traveled from Spain — making it one of the first Latin American countries to confirm the arrival of the disease.

Medical experts fear the disaster brewing in Guayaquil may offer a frightening glimpse of what awaits the region in coming weeks and months.

“More contagion, more mortality,” said Enrique Acosta, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic research in Germany. “They are closely intertwined.”

Acosta is among a group of policy experts urging Latin American governments to quickly ramp up testing. They note that in countries like Singapore and South Korea, where the virus has been more quickly contained, testing was widespread. But that is not the case in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Medical professionals believe the true number of coronavirus cases in Ecuador could be five times the official count or higher.

Teran, the funeral home owner, said he went to a cemetery on Tuesday where workers usually inter about 30 people a day, but 149 bodies were awaiting burial or cremation.

He said many funeral homes are not operating, while those that are have to send workers to pick up bodies without adequate protection. By law, he said, funeral homes can’t pick up bodies until a doctor has signed off on a cause of death, but because so many physicians are treating patients, bodies are accumulating in morgues, creating a backlog.

Not all of the dead are dying from the coronavirus — which for most people, causes only mild to moderate symptoms, like a fever and cough. But for others, particularly older adults and those with other health problems, it can lead to pneumonia and death.

Carmen Suarez, 71, died at her home over the weekend in Guayaquil from what the family believes was kidney failure. Relatives tried to find a hospital that would accept her as her legs grew increasingly swollen, but were told no beds were available and that taking her to a hospital would be risky anyway because of the coronavirus spread.

By Tuesday, the family had spent three days waiting for her body to be taken away. They eventually called a funeral home worker who brought a coffin and embalmed her body, which was still waiting on the family’s patio.

“It’s catastrophic what is happening in Guayaquil,” said Byron Moreira, 36, her son-in-law. “I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.”

Esteban Ortiz, a public health specialist, said that in the province of Guayas, which includes Guayaquil and where 70% of the country’s virus cases are located, only around 175 ventilators are likely available. On Thursday, 225 people were hospitalized, including 122 in serious condition nationwide, indicating a likely critical shortage of the live-saving equipment.

“We’re not giving them a chance to come and get medical attention,” he said.

The Ministry of Public Health did not respond to requests for comment. But at a news conference Wednesday, health authorities defended Ecuador’s response, saying that new technology would soon allow testing to increase to 1,400 a day.

Jorge Wated, the official tasked by the government with handling the death toll crisis, said authorities were preparing for many more fatalities and working to ensure all are buried appropriately. He said authorities usually pick up about 30 people who have died in their homes each day, but have been picking up around 150, not all of whom died of COVID-19.

“We ask for forgiveness for those who had to wait days for their loved ones to be picked up,” he said.

Gina Watson, representative for the Pan American Health Organization in Ecuador, said experts expect to see a similar uptick in cases elsewhere in the region.

“Guayaquil is experiencing what we expect to see in all countries,” she said. “A rising curve of cases along with the associated mortality.”

Until he came down with a 102-degree fever a week ago, Larrea had no known health problems other than being overweight, his family said.

The family called doctors, who advised him to stay home and take an over-the-counter fever reducer.

As he grew worse — struggling to breath and changing color — the family called for an ambulance, only to be told none were available to go to their poor neighborhood.

The family was dependent on the 42-year-old Uber driver and father of four for their economic livelihood and together with other relatives — eight people in total — live in a small home.

Netherlands,04-06-2020 00:00,https://nltimes.nl/2020/04/06/netherlands-expanding-covid-19-testing-today,Netherlands expanding Covid-19 testing from today,"Starting on Monday, the number of daily tests for Covid-19 performed in the Netherlands will be scaled up. Currently some 4 thousand tests per day are done for the coronavirus. In the coming days and weeks, that will be more than quadrupled to about 17,500 tests per day.

Minster Hugo de Jonge of Public Health announced the new test policy last week Tuesday. He wants to ensure that all healthcare workers and the vulnerable people they work with can be tested and protected. The extra tests will initially go to healthcare workers and patients in nursing homes, disabled care, home care, and mental health care. After that, GPs can offer tests to people in risk groups.

In order to increase testing capacity, public health institute RIVM expanded the number of labs that can test for Covid-19 from 15 to 41, NU.nl reports. If necessary, these laboratories can be charged to run 24 hours a day, increasing the possible tests to 29 thousand per day.

The RIVM will keep using its current test kits, which take about 24 hours to confirm a coronavirus diagnosis. Biotech companies are increasingly making faster tests, that can diagnose a Covid-19 infection within a few hours. But these tests are not yet widely available and it is important that all labs test in the same way, a spokesperson for the RIVM said to NU.nl. ""If different tests are done left and right, they are of little use in terms of reliability,"" he said.","['17,500 tests']",,,

The Netherlands is the latest country to reject China-made coronavirus testing kits and other protective gear, calling the items substandard and raising serious questions about the quality of the supplies Beijing is selling to the world.

The Netherlands joins Spain, Turkey, Georgia, and the Czech Republic in their concerns over masks and test kits. The claims come as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases surge in the United States and Europe, highlighting the dependence many countries have on Chinese imports.

DUTCH PRIME MINISTER WARNS PUBLIC AGAINST SHAKING HANDS- PROMPTLY DOES IT MOMENTS LATER

The Dutch health ministry said over the weekend that it was forced to recall 600,000 face masks that were shipped from China on March 21 after they were found to be faulty. Some of the masks failed to fit the mouth properly while others were found to have insufficient filters, the government said.

""Health care workers have been informed and told not to use the masks. Due to the shortages, we can find ourselves in a situation where only protective equipment is available that does not meet the highest standards,"" the health ministry said in a statement. ""This is an issue in all countries.""

On Monday, the Netherlands said the number of people hospitalized with the coronavirus hit nearly 4,000. Of those, 507 new patients were admitted to the hospital. The number of deaths rose by 93 to 864.

Testing in the Netherlands is mostly confined to people with serious symptoms, meaning it's likely the numbers of cases of coronavirus are higher.

CORONAVIRUS: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

On March 19, Bruno Bruins, the medical care minister leading the Dutch government's fight against the coronavirus, resigned after collapsing from exhaustion during a parliamentary debate on the pandemic a day earlier.

""The nature of this crisis is such that it demands a minister who can be ready to go full throttle immediately,"" Rutte said during a televised press briefing.

The Syrian government unrolled sweeping measures on March 15 to combat the spread of the coronavirus, closing universities, schools, government offices, restaurants and markets, as well as shutting down all intercity public transportation across the country. The government also suspended military conscription, a cornerstone of its sustained military campaign.

On March 20, the government banned entry for foreigners, after the first coronavirus victim reached Syria by road from Lebanon after returning from Europe. Health officials have limited testing capacity, but have deployed medical teams at the national level and to 1,864 health clinics across the country. The World Health Organization also supplied the government with testing kits, but only one Damascus-based lab is reportedly testing for the virus. Prices for masks, disinfectant and medicine have surged while the public health infrastructure remains fractured and under-resourced.

China already deployed several medical teams to assist with the outbreak in Iraq and Iran, and has provided testing kits to Syria. China’s U.N. ambassador joined the U.N. call for the lifting of sanctions on Syria, suggesting it is only a matter of time before Beijing assists Damascus. The United States has committed an additional $16.8 million for humanitarian programming for Syria under USAID’s $274 million fund for countries affected by coronavirus.

The threat of an outbreak could also thaw Syria’s relations with several countries in the region, and rally support for the Assad government. Last week, following the Group of 20 summit, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed extended the UAE’s support for the Syrian people in his first call with the Syrian president since a 2011 break in bilateral ties.

Other parts of Syria lack health-care services

My research suggests Syria’s opposition-held areas face a dire threat without the proper resources to prevent the spread of the disease — or even identify it. In Idlib, nearly 3 million Syrians are particularly vulnerable, particularly the 1 million living in crowded camps along the Turkish border.

The World Health Organization has shipped 300 test kits to the city of Idlib, and promised to supply an additional 2,000 tests, and a testing lab at Idlib Central Hospital will begin testing this week. The WHO will deploy an additional 1,000 health-care workers and as many as 10,000 masks and 500 respirators to the city and surrounding areas to run the emergency response and testing process in the few remaining clinics and hospitals.

AD

But tests alone won’t be sufficient to prevent the spread of coronavirus, particularly in densely populated displacement camps. Many in these camps already lack shelter, and access to water and food. The simplest preventive actions — quarantine, washing hands, disinfecting — are not available options for most displaced Syrians. Any coronavirus outbreak would probably prove fatal for hundreds of thousands of civilians, particularly the elderly and those with chronic illnesses.

AD

The compounding needs in Idlib suggest extensive multilateral support will be needed for logistics and delivery of medical services to respond to coronavirus cases, in addition to a comprehensive response from emergency aid providers to address existing shortages of food, water, shelter and other daily essentials. However, hope for such an outcome is grim as major donor countries — the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union countries — address their own coronavirus crises.

Northeast Syria has few hospitals

In northeast Syria, the Kurdish-led administration initiated a curfew ordered the closure of businesses, restaurants and events. The border with the rest of Syria is now closed, other than cross-border aid deliveries from Damascus. Only one of 16 hospitals in the region is fully functional. Two additional hospitals identified to quarantine and treat patients, are underequipped, with only 28 beds for intensive care, 11 ventilators, and two doctors trained to use them.

AD

AD

Ongoing disputes between Turkish-held groups and the SDF exacerbate the situation. On March 24, Turkish-backed groups shut off water to the city of Al-Hasakeh, creating increased risks of coronavirus and other disease outbreaks for some 460,000 residents, including tens of thousands living in the Al-Hol displacement camp.

The immediate challenge for Northeast Syria is access to outside coronavirus experts. While WHO officials can reach Idlib via U.N.-approved borders, they cannot cross from Iraq into northeast Syria. The push by China and Russia to end the Syria cross-border aid mechanism under Resolution 2449 in January left the northeast out of reach of U.N. assistance.

Obtaining testing kits and expanding the region’s health-care capacity depends heavily on whether the WHO can access northeast Syria from Damascus, a process that historically has been fraught with political challenges for U.N. agencies. The U.N. Security Council could opt to grant WHO authorization for cross-border assistance at all official crossings — allowing aid to arrive via Iraq and Jordan. This might give the peripheral areas of Syria access to lifesaving medical care as the coronavirus spreads — which seems inevitable, given the experience of other countries.

What happens now?

It will take more than a nationwide cease-fire to prevent a covid-19 disaster in Syria. The WHO hopefully will be able to coordinate a response with government and nonstate groups that addresses all of Syria’s medical needs, despite the country’s geographic and political fragmentation, deteriorating health-care infrastructure and lack of government resources. Otherwise, regions outside of government-held areas will be underprepared to face the crisis.

Home to some three million people, the rebel-held region of Idlib has yet to record a single Covid-19 case, but conditions in the country's last major rebel bastion are especially ""ripe"" for an outbreak, aid groups have warned.

Coronavirus: Syria confirms first case amid fears of major outbreak Read More »

In the latest wave of displacement, nearly one million people in the northwest have been forced from their homes by a blistering regime offensive, which has slowed since a ceasefire went into effect this month.

But a large number of people continue to live in tented camps and makeshift housing along the Turkish border, where basic hygiene is lacking.

This has prompted deep concern after the government in Damascus on Sunday announced the country's first official Covid-19 case.

Protective gear on the way

""Testing will be available in Idlib in two days,"" WHO spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson said on Monday.

Some 300 Covid-19 diagnostic kits are to be delivered to a laboratory in Idlib city on Wednesday and ""testing should start shortly afterwards"", he said.

An additional 2,000 tests would be delivered as soon as possible, he added.

Technicians in Idlib have been trained to use the kits and laboratories in neighbouring Turkey would also be on standby to help if needed.

As part of a wider response plan for the region, three hospitals with intensive care units have been modified as isolation units equipped with ventilators, the WHO spokesman said.

Up to 1,000 healthcare workers have been mobilised and a new delivery of protective gear - including 10,000 surgical masks and 500 respirator masks - should arrive within the week.

'Extremely concerned'

So far, three suspected cases in northwest Syria have tested negative after hospitals sent samples to Turkey, Halldorsson said, but concern remained high.

""WHO is extremely concerned about the impact Covid-19 may have in the northwest,"" Halldorsson said.

""Displaced people [there] live under conditions that make them vulnerable to respiratory infections,"" he said.

Those included overcrowded living conditions, physical and mental stress, as well as a lack of housing, food and clean water.

Misty Buswell of the International Rescue Committee said on Monday that deplorable living conditions in Idlib had ""already left hundreds of thousands of people in poor health, making them even more vulnerable"".

""It is possible that the disease is already making its way through the population"" in Idlib, she said in a statement.

Eighty-five attacks on health facilities last year make the region all the more vulnerable, she warned.

""The majority of hospitals that remain open are unable to cope with needs that already exist,"" Buswell said.

Prayer gatherings suspended

Syria's war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, displaced millions and ravaged the country's infrastructure since starting in 2011 with anti-government protests.

Late last year, less than two-thirds of the country's hospitals were functioning, while 70 percent of health workers had fled the country, WHO says.

Over the past week, the Damascus authorities have taken increased measures to stem the spread of the virus.

Schools, universities and restaurants have been closed and prayer gatherings suspended.

The World Health Organization has begun working with doctors to test for coronavirus in opposition-held areas of Syria. So far, three tests have been conducted.

The samples — delivered across the Syrian border be tested in a lab in Turkey — all were negative. The WHO says that next week, 300 testing kits are expected to be delivered to a laboratory in Idlib province, so health workers in the rebel-held area can conduct tests themselves.

Next week will also see a shipment of 10,000 examination gloves, 1,200 gowns, 10,000 surgical masks, 500 respirator masks, and 900 face shields, in addition to 200 protective goggles.

From Idlib city, Dr. Munzer Khalil says a coronavirus outbreak would pose a huge challenge.

""In all of northern Syria, there are 200 ICU beds. And in case the virus spreads explosively, then we need thousands of ICU beds, which is certainly not available,"" Khalil says.

In camps in northern Syria, hundreds of thousands of people displaced by fighting live in squalor. One aid worker recently drove around a rainy camp and described ""dirt and mud and frustration, and displacement, and tents.""

""And on top of everything,"" she says, ""we're scared of coronavirus and we don't know what God has written for us. If it comes, God forbid, it will affect many people because the precautions being taken here are very little and very weak.""

Social distancing and rigorous hand washing are all but impossible in the camps. There is already an outbreak of swine flu in Syria's northwest.

In Idlib province, medical facilities have been hit by airstrikes, and most medical professionals have left Syria altogether.

""It's only a question of time when we will see confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Syria, because we know that every neighboring country and territory they have confirmed cases,"" says Hedinn Halldorsson with the WHO.

Meanwhile, in the capital Damascus, the WHO has supplied testing kits to the government, which says that of 103 tests conducted so far, all were negative. There are challenges there, too. Social distancing measures have been announced, but recent state TV footage from Damascus showed people out shopping.

According to the World Health Organization, testing for the novel coronavirus is to start within days in northwest Syria, amid fears of a disaster if the pandemic reaches overcrowded displacement camps.

""Testing will be available in Idlib in two days,"" WHO spokesman Hedinn Halldorsson said on Monday.

More:

Some 300 COVID-19 diagnostic kits are to be delivered to a laboratory in Idlib city on Wednesday and ""testing should start shortly afterwards"", he said.

An additional 2,000 tests would be delivered as soon as possible, he added.

So far three suspected cases in northwest Syria have tested negative after hospitals sent samples to Turkey, Halldorsson said, but fears remain high.

""WHO is extremely concerned about the impact COVID-19 may have in the northwest,"" Halldorsson said.

""Displaced people [there] live under conditions that make them vulnerable to respiratory infections,"" he told the AFP news agency.

Those included overcrowded living conditions, physical and mental stress, as well as a lack of housing, food and clean water.

As part of a wider response plan for the region, three hospitals with intensive care units have been modified as isolation units equipped with ventilators, the WHO spokesman said.

Up to 1,000 healthcare workers have been mobilised, and a new delivery of protective gear, including 10,000 surgical masks and 500 respirator masks, should arrive within the week.

Bracing for wider closures

Concern about all the displaced was increased after the Damascus government on Sunday announced the country's first official case of the novel coronavirus.

Lines formed outside grocery stores, banks and petrol stations across the Syrian capital, Damascus, as people braced for wider closures. The government has already closed restaurants, cafes and other businesses, and has halted public transportation.

The city's famed Hamidiyeh souk, a network of covered markets running through the Old City, was deserted after the government ordered all shops closed on Sunday.

Authorities closed border crossings with Lebanon and Jordan, and Damascus International Airport was closed to commercial traffic after a final flight arrived from Moscow. State-run newspapers issued their last print edition and will only be available online.

Syria has close ties to Iran, which is a key ally of the government in the civil war, and Shia pilgrims frequently travel between the two countries. Syria's health ministry reported the first case of coronavirus late Sunday - a 20-year-old woman it said had arrived from another country, without elaborating.

Ravaged by war

An open-ended curfew went into effect Monday in parts of northern and eastern Syria, which are controlled by a Kurdish-led civilian administration. It was not immediately clear how that would affect hundreds of US troops stationed in the region.

Syria's healthcare system has been ravaged by nearly a decade of war that has displaced millions of people and spawned rampant poverty. Hospitals and clinics across the country have been destroyed or damaged. The government is also under heavy international sanctions linked to its conduct during the war.

Most people only experience mild symptoms from the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus and recover within weeks. But it is highly contagious and causes severe illness in some patients, particularly the elderly and those with weakened immune systems. People can carry and spread the virus without showing any symptoms.

The Syrian government announced on Sunday its first case after unconfirmed reports suggested the virus had been detected but covered up, a charge officials denied while rolling out tight measures as the disease swarmed neighboring countries.

In the rebel-held northwest, no cases have been confirmed, but patients have been showing possible symptoms for weeks and 300 test kits should arrive in the next two days, the World Health Organization and a medics group said.

“Health infrastructure and basic services have all been decimated over much of the country ... and Syrians are very likely to be some of the most vulnerable to the spread of the virus globally,” said Rachel Sider, policy and advocacy adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council.

“What’s very clear is they’re nowhere near ready for an outbreak,” said Sider.

In Damascus on Monday, crowds of pedestrians, many in masks, still filled some streets, despite curbs like shutting schools and businesses, banning public transport and suspending flights.

The army command declared on Saturday it had prepped military hospitals and gave orders to minimize gatherings.

Samer Khodr, head of Damascus hospital, said all private and public hospitals across the country were ready under a national plan to tackle the virus.

Residents say prices of disinfectants and masks have skyrocketed in the capital, where panic buying has also gripped shoppers in recent days.

The head of a local Damascus-based NGO said there was limited capacity to determine cases, with only one main lab testing for the virus so far. Some cases were being treated in military hospitals, the person added, asking to remain anonymous.

Despite just a single case declared, one diplomat said the virus was likely more widespread than known, owing to low testing capacity and lack of transparency.

The Syrian Observatory, a Britain-based war monitor, said doctors had received threats from the government not to disclose cases. “Doctors have been instructed to refer to cases that are suspected to be corona infections as severe pneumonia,” said its director Rami Abdulrahman.

A U.N. source said three Syrians who tested positive at the weekend in Beirut, which is trying to contain a coronavirus outbreak, had recently arrived from Syria.

The government has denied covering up any cases, though close ties with its top regional ally Iran, the worst hit country in the Middle East, had increased the likelihood of the virus gaining a foothold.

Militias backed by Iran, which operates military and civilian flights to Syria, fight alongside Syrian army soldiers. Thousands of Shi’ite pilgrims from Iran and other countries also usually visit Damascus.

In parts of Syria outside state rule, Kurdish-led forces in the northeast and Turkey-backed opposition groups in the northwest have also closed crossings.

Displaced Syrians in the northwest live in overcrowded makeshift camps, leaving medics worried that an outbreak would be particularly lethal.

A Russian-backed Syrian government offensive there has uprooted nearly 1 million people in recent months and left its infrastructure in tatters.

Ahmad al-Dbis of the U.S.-based medical charity UOSSM, which operates in opposition territory, said fighting in the past year had destroyed much of the region’s medical facilities and left a stock of only 175 ventilators.

“Countries like Italy, France, Spain and others couldn’t escape from the coronavirus crisis so what will it be like for northwest Syria?” said Dbis.

The arrival of test kits this week, though limited, will allow doctors to finally begin checking for the virus. A handful tests were shipped to Turkey so far but no cases have come back positive.

“There are many cases coming to facilities and hospitals with the symptoms but we don’t have the capacity to make the diagnosis,” said Bashir Taj Aldin, a doctor with the Syrian American Medical Society which operates in Idlib.",['300 test kits'],['175 ventilators'],,
Syria,04-06-2020 05:21,https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/04/coronavirus-concerns-pause-aid-work-northeast-syria.html,"Amid coronavirus concerns, some US-funded aid work paused in northeast Syria","The global spread of the coronavirus and its reported trickle into Syria has forced the United States and its local partners to pause some of their humanitarian activities in the country’s northeast.

“Activities that bring people together, like seed distribution, vocational training and psychosocial support to children in education centers, are not possible right now due to COVID-19,” a State Department spokesperson told Al-Monitor.

Some programs, such as business literacy courses, have been moved online, the spokesperson added. The United States is still pressing ahead with plans to rehabilitate a water station in the town of Hajin while adhering to social distancing practices.

The spokesperson added that some of the US-funded stabilization activities in the northeast were already scheduled to end this month, specifically noting a program that supports independent media in Syria.

Those US-supported activities ending this month are expected to be replaced with “new programs that reflect the latest priorities and needs.”

Reached by Al-Monitor over WhatsApp, Abdulqader Muahed, co-chair of the Humanitarian Affairs office in the self-administration, said suspending programs was a necessary but unfortunate step.

“We are working on minimizing the negative effects and maintaining the flow and accessibility of basic assistance and services,” Muahed said. “The most vulnerable will definitely be affected.”

Muahed added that the Kurdish-led government’s US partners informed him and other officials in a recent video conference that there will be a greater focus on Syria’s eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, where Americans troops were deployed in October to guard the region’s lucrative oilfields from the Islamic States and regime-backed forces.

The State Department spokesperson confirmed that stabilizing Deir ez-Zor, as well as Hasakah province, where the US also has a presence, are continued priorities.

The first case of coronavirus was announced in Syria on March 22. As of April 5, the government of President Bashar al-Assad had reported 19 COVID-19 cases and two deaths in regime-held areas. But independent reports and accounts from doctors suggest the real number is much higher than Damascus will admit.

Northeast Syria, as with the rebel-held northwest, hasn’t yet reported any cases of the virus, but officials are bracing for a wave of infections they fear will overwhelm their war-battered health system.

“There is a shortage of everything now,” said Mehmud Bro, deputy minister for the Social Affairs and Labor office in the self-administration. “Medicines, sterile materials and masks are scarce, and the World Health Organization is moving very slowly.”

“It would be an unimaginable catastrophe in the event of a coronavirus outbreak,” he added.

Even before the threat of coronavirus, the Kurdish-majority region was dealing with a shortage of supplies and testing. Faced with a veto threat from Russia, the UN Security Council voted in January to seal the border crossing from which 40% of northeast’s medical provisions were supplied.

In a region where an estimated 1.6 million people rely on humanitarian assistance, there are just 28 intensive care unit beds, 11 ventilators and two doctors trained to use them, according to the International Rescue Committee. Of the northeast’s 16 hospitals, only one is fully functioning.

“Hospitals and medical centers are only providing primary medical care. They cannot provide holistic and comprehensive care for citizens. So imagine how it would be if people were infected with COVID-19?” said Dr. Joan Mustafa, co-chair of the Health Authority.

The only testing facility was rendered out of service during Turkey’s military operation against the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces in October, which also forced aid organizations to pull out and displaced some 200,000 residents.

In the absence of COVID-19 tests, authorities are identifying possible cases with basic temperature checks, as well as using leftover test kits they would normally use for things like polio and HIV, the Rojava Information Center told Al-Monitor. They’re also using tests provided by a Swedish nongovernmental organization that use spit to determine a person’s white blood cell count and detect certain proteins.

Samples from about 20 of these suspected cases, according to Bro, were sent off to a laboratory in regime-held Damascus where results can take as long as a week. All have so far come back negative.

A big fear among Kurdish officials and aid workers are the thousands living in crowded camps and informal settlements where access to clean, running water for hand washing is limited and social distancing all-but-impossible. Highly vulnerable to an outbreak is al-Hol camp in Hasakah, where some 70,000 displaced people, including Islamic States members and their families, are packed into squalid tents.

“The immunity of the residents of the camps is weaker due to their nutrition. There is no type of vegetables or fruits in their diet at all,” Bro said. “The situation is very scary”

Kurdish officials have responded to the coronavirus threat by sealing their territory’s border with Iraqi Kurdistan and enforcing a two-week curfew they say can be extended “in case of necessity and the public interest.”

Syria applies own treatment to fight Covid-19

7 de abril de 2020, 11:38Damascus, April 7 (Prensa Latina) Syria is currently applying a new treatment protocol to fight Covid 19. This project is based on domestically-manufactured drugs including chloroquine and azithromycin, in addition to enabling 25,000 hospital beds available in the country.

The report, released by Nizar Yazegi, minister of Health, detailed that about 100 daily tests were conducted and mechanism are created to raise up to 300.Mr. Yazegi also said that strict controls are being implemented through teams of 750 volunteers across usual regions in the country, where visitors attend religious ceremonies, limiting any other type of tourist activity.Likewise, the minister pointed out that the main cities are set with isolation centers, including hotels, university residences and 450 rooms offered to various social organizations.Yazegi affirmed there are great difficulties in acquiring, among other medical supplies, the necessary equipment for artificial respiration due to the unilateral commercial and financial US blockade and the majority of Western European governments, fundamentally.Syria has 19 positive Covid-19 cases to date, of them two deaths, and the country is applying measures such as suspension of domestic and international transport.sus/pll / oda / pgh",,,"['25,000 hospital beds']",

There is no running water, soap is expensive and hand sanitizer is an unaffordable luxury. She cannot even imagine what social distancing for her family of 16 would look like in the three tents they share in a makeshift camp near the Turkish-Syrian border.

""We try with our limited capabilities to keep clean. All those sanitizers, cleaning materials that you are talking about, we can't get,"" Um Ali tells CNN.

She lives in one of the many camps that have cropped up in the fields, olive groves, and rolling hills of Syria's rebel-held Idlib province. Most of the children have runny noses from exposure to harsh living conditions.

The family has dodged death multiple times over the course of the ongoing nine-year conflict in Syria. They fled a regime assault in Hama province when the war began in 2011, moving from one town to the next as the fighting dragged on.

Fatima Um Ali's family has run away from danger throughout Syria's nine-year war, but with barely any water or hygiene items, they struggle to keep away the novel coronavirus.

But they can't run away from the global pandemic. COVID-19 is heading toward the war-ravaged province like a ""slow moving tsunami,"" the World Health Organization says, and could claim tens of thousands of lives.

Idlib's population of 3 million, already buckling under extreme shortages of medicine, is considered to be one of the world's most defenseless against the virus.

Medical facilities in Idlib have been decimated in targeted airstrikes over the years. Doctors are already overstretched and hospital beds are in short supply. A brutal Syrian government offensive -- propped up by Russia and Iran -- that was launched in December added more pressure on the flailing healthcare facilities. The latest string of attacks also displaced nearly 1 million people, cramming the growing influx of families into sprawling camps with no infrastructure and increasingly unsanitary conditions.

The humanitarian crisis could culminate in an unparalleled health crisis when COVID-19 reaches Syria's northwest, says Dr. Munther Khalil from the opposition-controlled Idlib Health Directorate (IHD).

""We don't know if we have the coronavirus yet, but we are expecting a tsunami with a high death toll because of the lack of medical infrastructure,"" he says.

We don't know if we have the coronavirus yet, but we are expecting a tsunami with a high death toll because of the lack of medical infrastructure Dr. Munther Khalil

Medics are raising awareness about hygiene requirements, but it's a hard sell for a population reeling from the effects of war. ""They have been through bombs, freezing to death, chemical attacks, so they are already resigned to death,"" Khalil said.

Idlib has only 1.4 doctors per 10,000 people, according to the IHD. Hospitals are already running at over-capacity, with an average 150% occupancy rate, according to the IHD. There are only around 100 adult ventilators in opposition-held parts of Syria, which includes Idlib and sections of the countryside of nearby provinces, and fewer than 200 ICU beds.

Dr. Mohammed Shahem Makki is the only person in Syria's rebel-held territories who can carry out tests.

When COVID-19 spreads through the rebel enclave, more than 100,000 people could die, according to Khalil.

The Early Warning and Alert Response Network (EWARN), the only disease surveillance group operating in this part of Syria, says that between 40 and 70% of the population could get infected, based on global transmission rates.

According to those estimates, at least 1.2 million people in Idlib could contract COVID19, explains Dr. Naser Mhawish, the surveillance coordinator of EWARN.

Testing for the coronavirus, another key component of the battle against the spread of the pandemic, has been slow to start.

In all of opposition-held Syria, only one doctor and one device can carry out tests for the virus. After weeks of waiting, 300 tests privately purchased by EWARN from a Turkish manufacturer arrived at the Idlib Central Hospital's laboratory on Wednesday. So far, they have tested four suspected cases -- all turned out negative.

The World Health Organization has said that it will also deliver some testing kits to opposition-held Syria. So far, these have not arrived, according to medical professionals in the enclave.

The organization has come under criticism for its slow response to the possibility of the pandemic hitting opposition-held areas, while making a delivery of the tests to Damascus.

""Corona(virus) and after corona(virus) -- the suffering in this area will continue and nobody will do what they have to do to stop this catastrophe,"" Khalil says. ""In general we think that the WHO and some donors they don't care a lot about this area.""

The country's ongoing civil war has complicated the emergency health response, according to WHO's acting Regional Emergency Director Rick Brennan.

We are busting our guts to make sure everything is ready. Rick Brennan

""The delay in supplying test kits to northwest Syria does not imply any favoring of one side of the conflict over the other, as some may choose to interpret it,"" Brennan says.

""We are busting our guts to make sure everything is ready,"" he says.

Even in government-controlled parts of Syria, capacity for testing remains low. The country has reported only five confirmed cases, but experts expect a bigger spread.

The White Helmets, accustomed to rescuing people from the rubble and dodging bombardment, are now facing off with the new coronavirus.

Damascus has received 1,200 testing kits from the WHO. According to the organization's Damascus representative, Dr. Nima Saeed Abid, 300 of these were used.

All of Syria is considered by the WHO to be a very high risk country in the event of the pandemic's outbreak. It has the largest population of internally displaced people in the world and its war has dealt a major blow to its health sector.

The White Helmets rescue group, officially known as Syria Civil Defense, are once again on the frontlines. Accustomed to pulling people from rubble as airstrikes pummel towns, the rescuers are now trying on hazmat suits.

""This pandemic is making my mind busy all the time, our work has been changed now and this is something that we are not used to do,"" says Laith Abdullah, a White Helmets volunteer.

The group has been retraining its volunteers to combat a new, invisible assailant. White Helmets volunteers have been disinfecting schools, IDP shelters and camps as a preventative measure against the spread of the virus. They have also helped set up quarantine facilities with limited resources.

""I am worried and have anxiety now because of the possibility of our capacity being divided while we face the coronavirus and a possible Syrian regime operation at the same time,"" says Ahmad Abu al-Nour, another volunteer.

One key humanitarian effort in Idlib is to raise awareness about preventative measures to contain the spread of the virus. The Turkish aid organization IHH has been going from tent to tent explaining containment measures for coronavirus. Other local NGOs have also been doing similar work. But without basic infrastructure, there is little that leaflets touting the importance of hand washing can do.

Back at the makeshift camp, Fatima Um Ali walks out of her tent and points to an empty blue plastic barrel. It's her family's allotment of water. A water truck is meant to come to the camp once a day to distribute water. But today the water tanker hasn't arrived, and the barrel is empty.

""When someone has been through everything we have been through from being displaced to bombardments, do you think that a virus would make that much of a difference?"" Um Ali says.

She is resigned to her fate and has decided to cling to her faith.

""I am afraid that we will get sick just like everyone else in the world,"" she says.

""But I am also not afraid because in God I trust.""",['300 tests'],,['200 ICU beds'],

""In one year, we lost around 76 health facilities in northwest Syria,"" Dr Munzer al-Khalil, from the Idlib Health Directorate, said in a statement released by the Syria Free campaign.

""Donors have cut their funds and medical staff have been killed, arrested or displaced. The health sector in Idlib cannot cope with the inevitable outbreak and we fear 100,000 people could die unless we get supplies immediately,"" he added.

'Corruption, clientelism and patronage'

Since the conflict broke out in March 2011, more than half of Syria's pre-war population of 23 million have been driven from their home and 80% now live under the poverty line, according to the United Nations.

According to the World Health organisation (WHO), only 50% of public hospitals and 47% of public primary health care centres were fully functional in Syria at the end of 2019.

The country has for now confirmed only five cases of the novel coronavirus but experts have cast doubts upon that figure with a policy memo released earlier this week by the London School of Economics flagging ""significant indications that a wider outbreak has already begun.""

The paper estimates that the maximum number of COVID-19 cases the country can ""adequately"" treat is 6,500 and that just half of the 650 intensive care (ICU) beds in public and private hospitals nationwide — excluding Idlib province — have ventilators.

It also states that ""corruption, clientelism and patronage"" are jeopardising the response in government-controlled areas and that staying at home is simply not an option for the country's poor as it is ""highly unlikely that Gos [Government of Syri] will introduce policies to reduce the financial burden of self-isolation"".

'Unacceptable risk'

Idlib, the northwestern region home to three million people, half of whom are displaced from other parts of the country, currently counts just 105 ICU beds according to al-Khalil.

""Our ventilators are always 100% occupied and we don’t have one single bed ready for a Corona case today. Camps are the perfect breeding ground for the virus and 400% overcapacity, with ten or more people sharing one tent. People don’t have enough water for drinking, let alone washing their hands,"" he added.

Some 460,000 people from al-Hassakeh city, Tal Tamer and the al-Hol and Areesha camps were without water for at least five days this week after pumping at the Allouk water station was interrupted. UNICEF said in a statement that the interruption put ""children and families at unacceptable risk"" from the disease.

Laila Kiki, Executive Director of The Syria Campaign, warned that ""it will be impossible to contain the outbreak"" if it reaches camps.

""There has not yet been a confirmed case of the virus in northwest Syria but with cases in neighbouring countries and four cases in Damascus, the conditions in camps and detention centres, it is only a matter of time before people start losing their lives,"" she said.

WHO has so far shipped 900 tests to Idlib and another 5,000 are expected to arrive next week. Personal protective equipment has also been distributed to 21 health care facilities but the Idlib Health Directorate is urging the UN agency to ramp up aid and provide ""urgently-needed ventilators, protective gear for medical staff and hand sanitiser to overcrowded camps.""

Detainees 'left to face the virus alone'

The UN Special Envoy to Syria, Geir O. Pedersen, who earlier this week called for an immediate nationwide ceasefire to allow aid to access all parts of the country, also voiced concerns for the people held in detention centres across the country.

He appealed ""on humanitarian grounds for large scale releases of detainees and abductees.""

Families for Freedom, which campaigns for freedom and justice for Syria’s detainees, said that they are terrified of COVID-19 spreading into the regime's underground detention dungeons.

""The Syrian regime who took our loved ones from us has no interest in protecting detainees. The world realises that COVID-19 can be deadly for those with compromised immune systems and the elderly but what about those who are broken down by starvation, torture, and who are left to face this virus alone?,"" Dr Hala al-Ghawi, from Families for Freedom, said in a statement.

""At the very least, international health organisations, such as the WHO, must have regular access to detention facilities in order to provide critical sanitary measures and medical treatment to detainees,"" he went on.",['900 tests'],,['105 ICU beds'],

The plan is to manufacture the tests in Senegal and the United Kingdom and, if the validation testing meets regulatory standards, they could be distributed across Africa as early as June.

More:

""Our focus is to provide tests to the African continent,"" Amadou Sall, director of the Pasteur Institute in Dakar, told Al Jazeera.

Sall and his team of researchers in the Senegalese capital, who previously worked on vaccines for yellow fever and dengue, developed the prototype for the diagnostic test in partnership with Mologic, a British biotech company founded by the inventor of a widely used pregnancy test.

200326065117792

Once ready, the tests will be produced in the UK and at a new Dakar-based facility managed by DiaTropix, a subsidiary of the Pasteur Institute that focuses on infectious disease testing.

According to Sall, the Dakar site will have an initial capacity to produce up to four million tests annually. The developers are also in early-stage talks for local manufacturing sites to be set up in other parts of the continent.

""When COVID-19 hit, we knew from the beginning that Africa would be disproportionally affected,"" Joe Fitchett, the medical director of Mologic told Al Jazeera. ""With a test like this, you can detect [the virus] very quickly on any part of the continent and then avoid transmission.""

To detect as many people as possible, Fitchett says the test will be sold at cost-price - which is approximately $1 - thanks to grant support from the UK government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

""The point is to keep it to the bottom,"" Fitchett said, adding they would work with suppliers to keep the price as low as possible.

Game-changer?

COVID-19, the highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has no vaccine or known treatment.

Until a vaccine is ready, widespread testing is seen as one of the most important strategies used to ""flatten the curve"" - slowing the spread of the contagion in an attempt to prevent already stretched healthcare systems from being overrun.

200319085112877

Earlier this month, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to build up their testing capacity to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, calling them to ""test, test, test"".

""The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,"" he told reporters in Geneva. ""You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected.""

With tests at advanced, centralised laboratories still costly and taking hours to complete, dozens of companies worldwide are working to develop rapid, easy-to-use kits and distribute them widely - but questions remain over their accuracy.

Price and availability, however, are not the only barriers to widespread use. By developing a test that can be done at home without any need for electricity, the researchers in Senegal say it can be of particular use in rural communities where power is limited, and laboratories are near inaccessible.

Their test can be done in two different ways - using saliva or blood. Those with an active infection would use a saliva swab to detect the new coronavirus, while those with a previously undetected case would use an at-home finger prick test to check for coronavirus antibodies.

There are currently more than 2,800 confirmed cases in 45 of the continent's 54 countries. While that is still significantly lower than the current epicentre in Europe, some analysts fear Africa is on course to follow a similar trajectory.

Such a scenario would spell disaster in a continent that accounts for 1 percent of global health expenditure but carries 23 percent of the disease burden. Weaker health systems, poor sanitation and water shortages are just some of the additional challenges that would make it harder to fight the virus.

The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has significantly ramped up its prevention strategy in recent weeks, training labs in 43 countries, a swift increase from only two countries that were able to test for the disease in February. It has also been providing 1,000 test kits to any country with cases. Chinese billionaire Jack Ma donated an additional 1.1 million test kits. But that still is only a drop in the bucket compared with what will be needed.

""In times like these, it's difficult for African governments to purchase tests which are also cheaper and cost-effective,"" Prashant Yadav, a global supply chain analyst at the Center for Global Health, told Al Jazeera.

That is why he says the continent having a test of its own could be a game-changer. ""You're giving people on the continent access to a new test which very other few groups have had access to,"" Yadav said.

Independent assessment critical

Prototypes for the diagnostic test are now being assessed by two laboratories in the UK; the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St George's University London. Additional tests have been sent for independent assessment at labs around the world, including Senegal, Spain, China, Malaysia and Brazil.

200323065933020

The development of the prototype comes less than three weeks after Mologic was awarded one million British pounds ($1.2m) from the UK government as part of a 46-million British pound ($56m) fund for international coronavirus prevention and research. That is lightning-fast for a diagnostic test, which typically takes years to develop.

Fitchett credited Mologic's partnership with the Pasteur Institute in Dakar for speeding up the process.

At the same time, he emphasised the importance of following all proper validation procedures.

""Independent assessment is so critical, which is why we're working with top labs on every continent,"" Fitchett said. ""It's not in our interest to send something out that's no good.""

Authorities have been cracking down on a rise in fake testing kits being distributed, often sold at a high markup, as people around the world search desperately to get tested amidst shortages.","['1,000 test kits']",,,
Zimbabwe,04-07-2020 10:03,https://allafrica.com/stories/202004070408.html,Zimbabwe: What Goes On Inside Zimbabwe's Only Approved COVID-19 Testing Laboratory,"Zimbabwe's only approved Covid-19 testing laboratory, the National Microbiology Reference Laboratory (NMRL), can test more than 400 samples a day and has scope to do more.

The tests, all using procedures approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO), centre on identifying the actual coronavirus itself, the RNA (ribonucleic acid) that gets into a host cell in a human and gets that cell to make copies of the virus.

Several procedures across a range of equipment are used to kill the virus in the sample, extract the RNA from the coating and then use the detection kits for Covid-19 virus to see if the RNA is from the Covid-causing virus.

There is a confirmatory process.

Given the correct reagents, the testing chemicals, WHO has approved that other equipment in the national laboratory and in several provincial laboratories procured to test for the HIV virus in the complex viral load tests can also be used to test for the coronavirus.

Once the necessary reagents are procured, then more testing can be done each day and testing can be decentralised.

In the present system, the samples go through a sorting process using the WHO-recommended biosafety cabinet, in which the virus is inactivated using a solution called lysis buffer, while still in the biosafety cabinet.

""Inactivation is done to actually kill the virus because what we are interested in is the blueprint of the virus, which is the RNA and once we kill the virus, we then proceed to extract the RNA in the extraction room.

""The RNA is the one that tells the virus what to do, either to fight or to produce attachments or even its virulence,"" said Mr Tatenda Takawira, a laboratory scientist with NMRL.

In the extraction room, staff extract the RNA using the two Biomereux extraction machines, each of which can handle 24 samples at a time, with each process taking 30 minutes.

""This means they can extract RNAs from 48 samples in every 30 minutes. As you might be aware, the virus is described as circular with spikes on top. So it is these spikes that we disintegrated in the sorting room and we are left with the RNA inside the shell, which we now want to extract.""

He said after extraction, the RNA is taken to the detection machine, which then proves that the extracted RNA is indeed Covid-19 or that is not.

""This is where the detection kits are used. Once we have our RNA, we then mix it with the detection kits in this machine to get the results. This machine can run up to 93 samples at a time,"" said Mr Takawira.

The process from sorting of samples to detection of the virus plus other administrative issues takes up to six hours before results are sent back to the requesting clinician.

All results are confirmed at the NMRL, whose process was described as gold standard and one in use globally.

NMRL acting coordinator Mr Exevia Mazarura said so far they were managing to run all specimens within the stipulated time frames, but should the need to exceed the capacity of existing equipment arise, the laboratory has other machines, which have been approved by WHO to conduct Covid-19 tests.

The machines include the Hologic Panther and Abbort M2000, which are being used to run viral load tests for HIV.

The country has 10 Abbort M2000 machines in the provinces and three Hologic Panther machines. GeneExpert machines, which are dotted across the country's provinces and districts would be used for Covid-19 tests.

""Once the required reagents for these machines are procured, they all should be able to conduct Covid-19 tests,"" said Mr Mazarura.

In addition to Government facilities, Government has also roped in private health institutions to conduct similar tests.",['19 tests'],,,

Meanwhile, African leaders have been holding virtual meetings to put together a continental response to the pandemic which has seen its statistics – cases, deaths, recoveries – growing in the last two weeks.

Rwandan president Paul Kagame called it a “productive conference call chaired by AU Chair President Cyril Ramaphosa,” according to him, the discussions centered on the need to speak with a common voice and seek Africa’s best interest.

“We discussed the need for Africa to stand together,speak with one voice and work through our institutions to mobilize resources and harmonize the support from international partners. Thank you to initiatives by African institutions such as African Development Bank and Africa Exim Bank for their support

“The meeting stressed the urgency & need to materialize all commitments swiftly and flexibly. Through coordinated action, we can succeed in mitigating the health and economic impact of COVID-19 on our population.

“The loss of and damage to life and economy globally and particularly in Africa is colossal….and so must be the amounts of energy and financial package(s) to bring things back to normal and beyond,” Kagame wrote on Twitter.

Some African leaders who participated included Senegal’s Macky Sall, Kenya’s Uhuru Kenyatta, Zimbabwe’s Emmerson Mnangagwa, DRC’s Felix Tshisekedi, Mali’s Ibrahim Boubakar Keita, Egypt’s Abdel Fatteh Al-Sisi and Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.

The African Union Commission chief Moussa Faki Mahamat and WHO boss, Tedros Ghebereyesus were also part of the meeting. “We were joined later by President Emmanuel Macron, a good partner for Africa,” Kagame added.

The Namibian president on Friday disclosed that he had held talks with his Chinese counterpart as part of efforts to strengthen Africa’s response to COVID-19. “I also expressed gratitude to President XI for China’s support and care of over 500 Namibian students in Wuhan and China during this pandemic,” Hage Geingob added.

Meanwhile South Africa’s Health Minister says the country is formally going to seek assistance from Cuba and China on managing the pandemic. Nigeria also confirms that it is awaiting a medical team from China to support its response to the virus.

April 3: Malawi’s index case,

A suburb of DR Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, will be put on lockdown for two-weeks starting Monday, Governor Gentini Ngobila announced on Thursday.

Gombe, an area that has a big expatriate population is believed to the the epicenter of the country’s coronavirus crisis. Only medical and other essential service providers will be allowed movement during the measure.

DRC currently has 134 cases concentrated in the capital. Governor Ngobila had last week abandoned a three-day total lockdown fearing price hikes and insecurity.

Malawi on Thursday also announced its first three cases of COVID-19, becoming the fiftieth African country to be infected. The cases involved a woman with India travel history, her relative and house worker are the two other patients.

Meanwhile in Rwanda, the army has confirmed that three soldiers are being probed over allegations of rape in a suburb of the capital Kigali whiles there were on COVID-19 lockdown enforcement duties.

Residents of Nyarutarama have been telling the military prosecution office that the soldiers also beat up male residents and stole from them, a BBC reporter in Kigali says.

One of the victims told journalists that on 26 March an armed soldier forced his way into her home and beat up her husband, when she tried intervene the soldier raped her.

April 2: Rwanda extends lockdown, Cameroon fund etc.

Rwanda has extended a strict lockdown imposed to help curb the coronavirus pandemic in the country. The measure was announced last month (March 21) and was due to expire on 19 April.

The lockdown was to end this weekend but was extended by the cabinet on Wednesday after the number of confirmed cases climbed from 17 to 82 in two weeks, the BBC said.

Under the regulations the populace was banned from leaving their homes with the usual exception covering essential services. Security forces were deployed to enforce the measure as government also rolled out a foot stimulus package for the vulnerable in parts of the country.

Over in Cameroon, President Paul Biya on Thursday announced a Solidarity Fund to fight the pandemic, state-run CRTV reported.

Government allocated a seed money of 1 billion CFA. Businessman, Baba Ahmadou Danpullo has donated a cheque of 100 million to the fund, the broadcaster added.

Cameroon is Central Africa’s most impacted country with 284 cases, seven deaths and 10 recoveries as of April 2.

In Botswana, president Eric Masisi was cleared to resume his duties in his office after working from home for the past two weeks due to self-isolation. He tested negative having taken a test as a precautionary measure after visiting Namibia on official duties last month.

At the time of his visit, Namibia had recorded cases but Botswana was virus-free. The country now has four confirmed cases with one death.

April 1: Burundi index case, Botswana death etc.

Burundi’s Health Minister Thadée Ndikumana announced on Tuesday that two nationals had tested positive for the virus after travelling from Rwanda and Dubai. The result leaves only South Sudan as the uninfected country in the East Africa region.

There had been doubts over Burundi’s claim that no-one in the country had coronavirus. The president’s spokesperson said the nation was an exception because it put “God first” reports said.

Botswana also announced its first coronavirus death barely 24-hours after after confirming its first cases. The government said the victim was an elderly woman who was discovered to have had COVID-19 after her death.

Vice-President Slumber Tsogwane said the 79-year-old had travelled to neighbouring South Africa and on returning home she had developed a fever. The woman was put under mandatory quarantine at the hospital where she died four days later.

The country is currently in a 28-day lockdown imposed by president Eric Masisi to help curb spread of the pandemic. In the southern Africa region Lesotho, Comoros and Malawi have yet to record cases.

The Ghana Health Service on Tuesday disclosed that some 3 persons out of the 161 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Ghana have tested negative after several tests.

According to the service, some additional 31 persons who were under mandatory quarantine have significantly responded to treatment, shown no symptoms and have been discharged from admission.

They will be under home management, pending several other tests to confirm their recovery status. Information on the GHS official COVID-19 update page said,

“Three (3) of the confirmed cases have fully recovered and reverted to negative status for COVID-19 after repeat test following recovery from symptoms.

“As at 31st March 2020, additional thirty-one (31) confirmed cases have significantly improved with no symptoms and have been discharged from admission for home care pending repetition of laboratory tests. This adds to the 18 that were earlier being managed from home and bring the number of cases on home care to forty-nine (49),” the statement read in part.

March 31: Botswana records cases, Uganda imposes 14-day lockdown

Botswana’s Minister of Health and Wellness has this evening announced that the country has three cases of COVID 19.

During a special bulletin the Minister Lemogang Kwape said the three patients are 2males and a female, who had travelled from Thailand and the United Kingdom respectively.

Kwape further indicated the COVID 19 patients are already in isolation undergoing treatment.

Botswana is the one of the two countries in the Southern Africa bloc which was still a green zone, which had not recorded any positive cases of COVID 19.

South Africa’s President Cyril Ramaphosa has launched a mass screening programme for coronavirus. South Africa is Africa’s most impacted country with over 30,000 tests and 1,280 cases as at March 30.

On Monday evening, the president said 10,000 field workers would be visiting homes to screen people – and those found with symptoms would be quarantined either in their homes or in hospitals.

Mr Ramaphosa said the programme was a “new phase” in the fight against the spread of the virus. Uganda joined South Africa and others in the lockdown category of countries after president Museveni spelt out raft of measures aimed at helping halt the spread of the virus.

March 30: Kenya wants MPs tested, lockdown experiences

Kenya’s lower parliamentary chamber wants some 50 lawmakers to be tested for coronavirus amid fears they may have contracted the virus from a member who recently tested positive, the Daily Nation newspaper reports

Local media reports say the parliament has submitted the names of MPs and parliamentary staff it wants tested to the health ministry. It wants them placed on mandatory quarantine as well.

The MP who tested positive is believed to have contracted the virus from a county governor who had returned from Germany on a working visit. Kenya currently has 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with two deaths.

Meanwhile Ghana and Zimbabwe joined the list of African countries enforcing lockdowns to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Zimbabwe is in a nationwide lockdown like in South Africa and Namibia. Zimbabwe has seven cases with one death.

Over in Ghana where confirmed cases are gone past 150, government has placed lockdowns on two major regions. The Greater Accra and Ashanti regions where cases have been recorded.

South Africa’s lockdown enforcement has been the subject of widespread criticism after security agents were seen assaulting unarmed citizens some of them within their compounds. The country has over 1,200 cases.

Pensioners are as at Monday morning queuing across the country for their allowances. The Ministry of Defense announced that it was ready to fall on other reserve forces to complement the current deployment.

Over in Kenya, there were clashes between the populace and security forces over the enforcement of a night time curfew that started last Friday. Multiple regional states in Ethiopia have banned transport as cases recently spread to Oromia and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has 23 cases presently.

Nigeria’s Lagos State along with Osun state and the capital Abuja have been put on lockdown by the federal government. Nigeria has 111 cases with over half in Lagos. Abuja is the next most impacted. About 12 other states have recorded cases with two in the north – Bauchi and Kaduna.

March 29: South Africa tally hits 1,200; cases rise across Africa

The South African government has reported that as at today, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 1280. This is an increase of 93 from the previously reported cases. Guateng and Western Cape provinces remained the most impacted with 548 and 310 cases respectively.

“It is with sadness that we announce the second death of a patient who had tested positive for COVID-19. The 74 year old male had been in ICU and ventilation in a private hospital in Ladysmith.

“He had travelled to Kruger National Park with his family and came back with flu like symptoms. He was confirmed to be COVID-19 positive on the 27th March 2020,” the statement signed by Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize read.

Cases continue to rise across Africa. Uganda recorded 10 cases over the weekend bringing the tally to 33. Ethiopia’s tally now stands at 21. Kenya now has 42 confirmed cases, the Health Minister confirmed on Sunday. Eritrea recorded a 100% raise in cases from six to 12 as at Sunday.

Nairobi County continues to lead with 31 cases of those who have so far tested positive, followed by Kilifi with six, Mombasa with three, while Kajiado and Kwale with one each. Out of the 42 positive cases, 24 are male while 18 are female.

Government has announced that the ministry’s medical teams have embarked on mass testing for all persons who arrived in the country last week, and are currently under mandatory quarantine in various designated hotels and government facilities.

March 28: Rwanda, Lagos State support vulnerable

The Rwandan government on Saturday, March 28, kick started a support initiative aimed at vulnerable families adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown. Rwanda currently has 60 confirmed cases.

President Paul Kagame had in a national address late last week highlighted the resolve of government to do everything possible to support vulnerable Rwandans during the lockdown citing its social and economic challenges.

The hard-hit Rwandans living in urban centres without a salaried income are the most affected. The initiative kicked-off in some parts of the three districts of Kigali, state-run New Times said.

The food relief is being drawn from the country’s National Strategic Grain Reserve under the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources which is used in case of food shortage, the portal added.

Over in Nigeria’s commercial hub of Lagos, the state government announced an Emergency Food Response as a means of supporting indigenes and the vulnerable. Neighbouring Ekiti State has announced a similar measures.

“We are all aware that this is a trying time for our citizens and since the partial drop in economic activities, our government deemed it necessary to reach out to the vulnerable ones in the society,” Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said.

For his part, Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, issued a new set of Executive Order with a raft of

orders which included reactivating the State’s food bank to support the vulnerable.

“I have directed that the Ekiti State Food Bank be reactivated immediately to provide food items to the poor and vulnerable families in our communities. The Task Force will announce the modalities as soon as the process is fully activated.

“The State Government will consider providing a stipend to our self-employed citizens whose daily income will be interrupted at this time as subsidy for their loss of income,” the order read in part.

March 27: Lesotho to lockdown on Saturday

Despite being among Africa’s virus-free nations, Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane, has announced a lockdown starting from Saturday, March 28, South African portal Eye Witness News reports.

The Mountain Kingdom landlocked by South Africa has not recorded any confirmed COVID-19 cases. It relies on South Africa to help with testing as it does not have the capacity to do so.

But on Friday, Ethiopian Airlines delivered coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits, masks, and protective suits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. The consignment arrived a day earlier than expected.

Lesotho’s ambassador to the African Union Mafa Sejanamane said delivery of the consignment was moved forward to ensure that it didn’t clash with South Africa’s national lockdown.

Meanwhile South Africa has revised the death toll of two to one after Health Minister Mkhize said one of the two persons announced earlier on Friday did not die of the virus.

The lockdown took effect with largely reports of obedience but also defiance in parts of the country leading security forces to make arrests and force others out of the streets. South Africa is Africa’s most impacted country with over 1,000 cases so far.

Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa also announced late Friday that the country will go into lockdown from Monday, March 30, in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus.

So far, the country has recorded five cases and one death, 30-year-old journalist Zororo Makamba. The low number of cases though “need not induce complacency”, Mr Mnangagwa said in an address to the nation.

For three weeks from Monday, Zimbabweans will be required to stay at home, except to buy food and access vital health services.

The southern African country is allowing the use of the US dollars again, reversing last year’s ban on foreign currencies – a move aimed at supporting the already struggling economy against the effects of coronavirus.

Libya, Guinea-Bissau and Mali record infections

Libya, the last country in North Africa has announced its first case of coronavirus. The Centre for Disease Control confirmed the case amid a continued battle between UN-backed government in Tripoli and the Benghazi rebel bloc led by Khalifa Haftar.

The country which has been in a state of conflict since 2011 has closed its borders according to orders by the rival governments.

Concerns have long been raised about the impact of the virus reaching the country whose health systems have been suffering in the amed conflict that has torn the country apart.

Over in West Africa, Mali confirmed its first cases of coronavirus – involving two citizens who returned from France on 12 and 16 March.

The patients are a 49-year-old woman from the capital Bamako and a 62-year-old man living in the western city of Kayes, the government said in a statement. The two are currently being treated as contact tracing efforts are carried out.

An AP report last week said the country’s under-resourced health system was one of the biggest headaches for authorities as cases continued to spread in the West African region. For now, only Sierra Leone and Guinea-Bissau are virus-free in West Africa.

Guinea-Bissau has registered its first two cases of coronavirus, Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam said on Wednesday.

The patients are a Congolese U.N. employee and an Indian citizen, and both have been placed in quarantine, he said, adding that public transport would be suspended to limit the spread of the virus.

Africa could be underreporting figures

“You know as of today (March 18), the number of cases reported from sub-Saharan Africa are 233 cases and four deaths, that is actually in terms of confirmed cases, it is the lowest region.

“But as Mike said, we cannot take this number as the amount of, or the number of cases we have in Africa, probably we have undetected cases or unreported cases. But in addition to that, even if we take this 233 cases as true, we have to prepare for the worst.

“In other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point. So the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today. It is actually better if these numbers are really true, to cut it from the bud.

“And that is why we are saying we have to do the testing, we have to do the contact tracing, we have to do the isolation and cut it from the bud,” the words of Ethiopian Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.

He was speaking on Wednesday March 18 in the WHO’s daily press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic.

He stressed the need for mass gatherings to be avoided because of the propensity of aiding quick spread of the virus. “I think Africa should wake up, I think my continent should wake up,” he added.

President Paul Kagame had in a national address late last week highlighted the resolve of government to do everything possible to support vulnerable Rwandans during the lockdown citing its social and economic challenges.

The hard-hit Rwandans living in urban centres without a salaried income are the most affected. The initiative kicked-off in some parts of the three districts of Kigali, state-run New Times said.

The food relief is being drawn from the country’s National Strategic Grain Reserve under the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources which is used in case of food shortage, the portal added.

Despite being among Africa’s virus-free nations, Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane, has announced a lockdown starting from Saturday, March 28, South African portal Eye Witness News reports.

The Mountain Kingdom landlocked by South Africa has not recorded any confirmed COVID-19 cases. It relies on South Africa to help with testing as it does not have the capacity to do so.

But on Friday, Ethiopian Airlines delivered coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits, masks, and protective suits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. The consignment arrived a day earlier than expected.

Lesotho’s ambassador to the African Union Mafa Sejanamane said delivery of the consignment was moved forward to ensure that it didn’t clash with South Africa’s national lockdown.

Meanwhile South Africa has revised the death toll of two to one after Health Minister Mkhize said one of the two persons announced earlier on Friday did not die of the virus.

The lockdown took effect with largely reports of obedience but also defiance in parts of the country leading security forces to make arrests and force others out of the streets. South Africa is Africa’s most impacted country with over 1,000 cases so far.

Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa also announced late Friday that the country will go into lockdown from Monday, March 30, in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus.

So far, the country has recorded five cases and one death, 30-year-old journalist Zororo Makamba. The low number of cases though “need not induce complacency”, Mr Mnangagwa said in an address to the nation.

For three weeks from Monday, Zimbabweans will be required to stay at home, except to buy food and access vital health services.

The southern African country is allowing the use of the US dollars again, reversing last year’s ban on foreign currencies – a move aimed at supporting the already struggling economy against the effects of coronavirus.

Eritrea, Uganda record index case

Eritrea and Uganda have recorded their index cases on Saturday with both nations announcing that the patients were nationals. It leaves only South Sudan and Burundi as East / Horn of Africa countries without infections.

Eritrea’s Information Minister posted on Twitter: “The Ministry of Health announced this evening the first confirmed case of a Coronavirus patient who arrived at Asmara International Airport from Norway with Fly Dubai at 7:00 a.m. LT this morning. The 39-year old patient is an Eritrean national with permanent residence in Norway.

“The patient was quarantined promptly following the screening process at the Airport & diagnosed positive for COVID-19 after subsequent tests at the National Laboratory. The patient is receiving all necessary treatment at the moment, the MoH has stated.”

In the case of Uganda, Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng told a press conference: “The confirmed case is a 36 year old Ugandan male who arrived from Dubai at 2:00am today, Saturday 21 March 2020 aboard Ethiopian airlines. He presented with symptoms of high fever and poor appetite.

“During the screening process at the airport, his temperature was 38.7. This prompted the health teams to isolate him at the airport for further follow up. Subsequent temperatures taken at intervals of 30 minutes and one hour remained the same,” she added.

Meanwhile the tally of cases on the continent stands at 1,187 according to WHO’s tracking website. 34 deaths have been confirmed and 122 recoveries in total. Ghana, DR Congo are among those that have recorded deaths recently.

Zimbabwe index case; Rwanda figures rise

Authorities in Zimbabwe have confirmed the first case of coronavirus becoming the 38th African country to be infected.

A statement from the Ministry of Health and Child Care said the patient was a 38 year-old Caucasian resident of Victoria Falls. He has a recent travel history to Manchester in the United Kingdom.

He arrived in the country on March 15 via South Africa. The statement adds that he self quarantined and subsequently reported symptoms leading to a test being run at a facility in the capital Harare.

Zimbabwe is the fifth southern African country infected. The government had earlier this week imposed a number of restrictions with the aim of keeping out the virus.

Defence Minister had last week alleged that the virus was God’s punishment on countries that had imposed economic sanctions on the country. She specifically cited the United States and President Trump.

Cape Verde records index case, Togo patient recovers

Cape Verde confirmed its first coronavirus case on Friday in a government statement. “The patient is a 62-year-old British citizen who entered the country on March 9 and began showing symptoms on March 16,” the statement said.

Over in Togo, the index patient is said to have recovered (tested negative) but is still under medical observation, state TV quotes the health minister as saying.

The West African nation is now dealing with eight other confirmed cases. Health Minister Moustafa Mijiyawa has asked travellers from high-risk countries “to exhibit the highest sense of responsibility and patriotism” and work with the authorities to curb the spread of the virus.

He urged the Togolese to “stay calm and not panic” but to follow strict crowd control measures put out by the government.

Meanwhile South Africa’s cases from 150 as at Thursday has reached 2020, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize confirmed on Friday. South Africa has consolidated second most infected on the continent only after Egypt with 210.

Mauritius infected, 16 death overall

Mauritius on Wednesday confirmed its first three cases of coronavirus. Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth who led a cabinet meeting on the pandemic late Wednesday said the three have been placed in isolation.

Two of the three cases involve cruise ship workers aged 21 and 25, while the third is a traveller from the UK aged 59. He said the government was tracing all the people the British traveller had come into contact with.

The government has closed all schools and borders points of the Indian Ocean island nation. It has also banned commercial flights and tourists for the next two weeks, beginning on Thursday, March 19.

Meanwhile the death toll in Africa has reached sixteen according to figures by the BBC. Six each in Algeria and Egypt, Two in Morocco and one each in Sudan and Burkina Faso.

Africa could be underreporting figures

“You know as of today (March 18), the number of cases reported from sub-Saharan Africa are 233 cases and four deaths, that is actually in terms of confirmed cases, it is the lowest region.

“But as Mike said, we cannot take this number as the amount of, or the number of cases we have in Africa, probably we have undetected cases or unreported cases. But in addition to that, even if we take this 233 cases as true, we have to prepare for the worst.

“In other countries we have seen how the virus actually accelerates after a certain tipping point. So the best advice for Africa is to prepare for the worst and prepare today. It is actually better if these numbers are really true, to cut it from the bud.

“And that is why we are saying we have to do the testing, we have to do the contact tracing, we have to do the isolation and cut it from the bud,” the words of Ethiopian Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization.

He was speaking on Wednesday March 18 in the WHO’s daily press briefing on the coronavirus pandemic.

He stressed the need for mass gatherings to be avoided because of the propensity of aiding quick spread of the virus. “I think Africa should wake up, I think my continent should wake up,” he added.

The Gambia, Djibouti, Zambia records first case

Djibouti’s Foreign Minister confirmed the country’s first coronavirus case which involved a member of a Spanish military contingent that entered the country recently.

He confirmed that the group have been isolated and were under medical supervision. None of them had contact with the Djiboutian people since entry.

The country is undertaking formalities that will allow for the contingent to be sent back to Spain within the shortest possible time. In the Horn of Africa region, Ethiopia and Somalia have all recorded cases. Sudan and Kenya have also done same.

A day after the Zambian authorities imposed wide ranging measures which included banning public gatherings and closing school, the first two cases were recorded according to a local news portal, Mwebantu.

The case involves a Zambian couple who arrived in the country on March 15 after a 10-day holiday in France aboard Emirates Airline, Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya said in a statement.

They were screened at the Kenneth Kaunda Airport and asked to under go self-quarantine because on arrival they showed no symptoms.

Whiles in quarantine, the husband reported symptoms following which authorities were notified and a test carried out on the couple returned positive.

The Gambia recorded its first coronavirus case yesterday in a statement by the health minister. The country becomes the 31st to be infected in Africa.

The case involved a young woman who flew in from the United Kingdom. All passengers on the flight she came in with are being traced, authorities confirmed.

Gambia’s only neighbour Senegal has also been greatly impacted by the pandemic with close to thirty confirmed cases. President Macky Sall last week announced a raft of measures that included ban on public gatherings and closure of schools.

The Gambia has yet to announce such measures which most African countries – affected or virus-free – are implementing as preventive or containment measure.

Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria record new cases

On Tuesday morning, Nigeria reported its third case in Lagos of a Nigerian lady who last travelled to the United Kingdom.

Kenya also reported a news case bringing its tally to four. The latest case was confirmed today at the National Influenza Centre Laboratory. The patient is reported to have travelled from London, United Kingdom on 8th March, 2020 arriving in the country on 9th March, 2020, a statement read.

In Ethiopia, Health Minister Lia Tadesse, said a new positive case involved a British diplomat who had entered Ethiopia from Dubai. She was self-isolating when the case was brought to the attention of the authorities. She is the sixth case for the country. Contact tracing is underway.

President Uhuru Kenyatta has also slated Saturday March 21, 2020 as a “Day of Prayer” as the country turns to God to seek his intercession in the midst of the pandemic.

The president stressed that Kenya has historically used prayer to seek divine intervention during hard times. The session will however take place at the State House and the media are to carry it live on their platforms to allow all Kenyans to participate.

The statement from State House read in part: “… we also turn to God to share our fears, our apprehensions, but also to seek his guidance and ever-present protection.

“With this in mind and after consulting a cross-section of ordinary Kenyans as well as our religious leaders, I have decided to declare this coming Saturday, 21st March 2020, as a National Day for Prayer.

“In consideration of the protocols that we announced on Sunday and other ongoing protocols that will be announced from time to time, I have thought it necessary that this day of prayer be observed in our homes, in our places of work or wherever we shall be residing on that day.

Flurry of restrictions, cases increasing

A number of African governments are announcing restrictions aimed at preventing the rise in coronavirus cases in their territories. From the closure of borders and the suspension of flights to banning of public gatherings and even in the case of Sudan declaring a state of emergency.

We pool together the major restrictions and measures by different governments:

Sudan: The Sovereign Council in Sudan has declared a state of emergency to help control the coronavirus pandemic. The country has only a case which has resulted in the death of the patient in question.

The council “decided to close all airports, land and sea border crossings, except to humanitarian aid,” spokesman Mohammad al-Fakki Suleiman told journalists. State news agency Suna quoted a military spokesman as saying that cadets and trainees would be given leave as a precaution.

Tunisia: The North African country announced it will be closing its land borders and airspace to all commercial activities from Wednesday, in a bid to protect the country from the spread of coronavirus.

Health officials say the number of confirmed cases has risen to 24. The latest announcement by Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh comes three days after a 16:00 curfew was announced for restaurants, cafes and bars.

All commercial flights are to be cancelled, but arranged evacuation flights will be permitted. Trade and cargo will not be affected by these measures.

Ivory Coast: The country via an announcement by President Alassane Ouattara on Monday evening announced a temporary ban on foreign visitors especially those from countries hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

The ban only applies to countries that have more than 100 confirmed cases, the authorities said in a statement on Monday. This includes the US, France, the UK and most of Europe.

For the next 15 days, only Ivorian nationals and permanent residents of the country will be permitted to enter from abroad following a mandatory two-week quarantine on arrival.

The security council headed by President Alassane Ouattara also ordered the closure of all schools and universities from Tuesday for a period of 30 days.

Chad: Despite being virus-free, Chad on Monday announced suspension of all flights effective midnight of March 19, 2020 in an official government statement.

Only cargo planes will be allowed to land at N’Djamena International Airport. Earlier reports said government quarantined a group of French passengers who arrived Sunday. Chad remains the sole Central African country unaffected.

Botswana and Zambia who are also virus-free have announced a series of measures similar to what most African countries have in place.

All schools, colleges and universities in Zambia to close indefinitely this Friday in response to the pandemic. The announcement has been made by the country’s minister of health, Dr Chitalu Chilufya. Zambia yet to report a confirmed case.

Zambia missions abroad have been directed to review visa applications for would-be travelers to Zambia. Foreign travel to high risk countries should be be postponed.

Buses from outside Zambia will not dock at the usual station—the InterCity—but at a dry port. This is to ensure a thorough screening of passengers. Isolation centers have been identified in different parts of the country.

Bars and churches will have restricted hours of operation. The southern African country has so far investigated 28 alerts but results have been negative.

Rwanda, Burkina record new cases

Rwanda and Burkina Faso have recorded increase in their tallies. Rwanda confirmed two new cases of coronavirus bringing the total number to seven.

The country’s ministry of health says of the two, one is a Rwandan woman whose husband had earlier tested positive. The other patient is a German who arrived in Rwanda from Germany on 13 March, then developed a cough and went to the hospital on 15 March.

Authorities in Burkina Faso also said five new cases had been recorded putting the overall tally at fifteen according to the WHO’s coronavirus tracking site.","['30,000 tests', '20,000 tests', '9,315 tests']",,,

The unsettling revelation places doubt on the country's real Covid-19 status amid claims some mysterious deaths that could be linked to coronavirus went unreported.

In a statement Monday, the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR), called on government to seriously consider risks posed at the ports of entry, health facilities and social protection of vulnerable groups among other priorities.

Zimbabwean authorities say the country now has eight confirmed Covid-19 cases and one death so far.

""To date, just under 200 tests have been done despite the over 16 032 returnees from countries with confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the Health Ministry statistics,"" ZADHR said.

The association urged President Emmerson Mnangagwa administration to deal with the deadly virus in a holistic manner.

It also highlighted the current approach by the Health Ministry in which voluntary self-isolation is encouraged as porous, lacking monitoring, and heightening the opportunity to import the virus into Zimbabwe.

""The state must be proactive than reactive in ensuring COVID-19 cases are identified at the ports of entry as compared to picking symptomatic patients in the community,"" the doctors said.

The remarks come as a follow up to the national lockdown which has seen police officers manning various residential areas in line with the government stance aimed at disrupting the spread of coronavirus to many locals.

But while expressing hope over the measures' effectiveness, ZADHR warned, ""we call upon the state to ensure the enforcement of the national lockdown in a manner that respects the rights of all citizens. The security forces must have adequate protective equipment and must be cautioned on violating the rights of citizens.""

The doctors group said isolation and treatment centres across the country were in a bad state, lacking intensive care facilities and often not manned by people who have the required experience in handling complicated COVID-19 cases.

ZADHR urged the government to ensure high levels of transparency in the representation of the country's state of preparedness by the health ministry and other Government officials.

The group said one of the solutions to achieve this was through ensuring that concerns on safety clothing raised by nurses and doctors were addressed as a matter of urgency.

HARARE, Zimbabwe -- “We are already ruined. What more harm can coronavirus do?"" Irene Kampira asked as she sorted secondhand clothes at a bustling market in a poor suburb of Zimbabwe's capital, Harare.

People in one of the world's most devastated nations are choosing daily survival over measures to protect themselves from a virus that “might not even kill us,” Kampira said.

Even as the country enters a “total lockdown” over the virus on Monday, social distancing is pushed aside in the struggle to obtain food, cash, cheap public transport, even clean water. The World Health Organization's recommended virus precautions seem far-fetched for many of Zimbabwe's 15 million people.

“It’s better to get coronavirus while looking for money than to sit at home and die from hunger,” Kampira said, to loud approval from other vendors.

The southern African nation has few cases but its health system is in tatters, and the virus could quickly overwhelm it. Hundreds of public hospital doctors and nurses have gone on strike over the lack of protective equipment. Many Zimbabweans are already vulnerable from hunger or underlying health issues like HIV, which is present in 12% of the population.

Last year a United Nations expert called the number of hungry people in Zimbabwe “shocking” for a country not in conflict. The World Food Program has said more than 7 million people, or half the country, needs aid.

Harare, like most cities and towns across Zimbabwe, has an acute water shortage and residents at times go for months, even years, without a working tap. Many must crowd communal wells, fearing the close contact will speed the coronavirus' spread.

“If the taps were working we wouldn’t be here, swarming the well like bees on a beehive or flies on sewage. We are busy exchanging coronavirus here coughing and spitting saliva at each other,” said 18-year old Annastancia Jack while waiting her turn.

The government has closed borders and banned gatherings of more than 50 people while encouraging people to stay at home.

But the majority of Zimbabweans need to go out daily to put food on the table. With inflation over 500% most industries have closed, leaving many people to become street vendors. Zimbabwe has the world’s second-largest informal economy after Bolivia, according to the International Monetary Fund.

Police in recent days have tried to clear vendors from the streets, in vain. As in other African countries where many people rely on informal markets, a lockdown could mean immediate food shortages.

Once-prosperous Zimbabwe was full of renewed promise with the forced resignation in late 2017 of longtime leader Robert Mugabe. But President Emmerson Mnangagwa has struggled to fulfil promises of prosperity since taking power. He blames the country's crisis in part on sanctions imposed on certain individuals, including himself, by the U.S. over rights abuses.

Daily necessities in Zimbabwe make social distancing an elusive ideal. In downtown Harare, hordes of people congregate at banks for cash, which is in short supply. Others pack public transport.

“We are the only ones practicing social distancing, we sit in our cars all day,” said Blessing Hwiribisha, a motorist in a fuel line snaking for more than a kilometer in the poor suburb of Kuwadzana.

“Look at them,” he said. He pointed at a supermarket across the road where hundreds of people shoved to buy maize meal, which has become scarce due to a devastating drought and lack of foreign currency to import more.

“What is happening in Zimbabwe is very scary. It’s like we are playing cards. Its either you win coronavirus or you win starvation,"" said Tinashe Moyo at the supermarket. ""I am very scared.""

Few health workers are available as doctors and nurses strike.

“There is a difference between being heroic and being suicidal,” said Tawanda Zvakada, president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association.

Health workers described a lack of disinfectants, sanitizers and even water at hospitals.

And yet Health Minister Obadiah Moyo repeatedly says Zimbabwe is “well prepared” to deal with COVID-19 cases.

But frightened health workers cited the death of a prominent broadcaster at an ill-equipped isolation center specifically reserved for COVID-19 cases.

“They didn’t have a ventilator to help him,” Zvakada said. “The inability of our system to manage one patient is worrying. What about when there are 50 patients?”

Zimbabwe has has less than 20 ventilators to help people in severe respiratory distress, he said. He said the country needs hundreds to adequately deal with the virus.

“We see a situation where Zimbabwe can become a graveyard if we are not careful,” said Itai Rusike, director of the Harare-based Community Working Group on Health.",,['20 ventilators'],,

Health experts say Zimbabwe’s hospitals are woefully unprepared for a major outbreak, and the government has been accused of understating cases which stood at nine on Sunday, with one death.

Ventilators are vital equipment in serious coronavirus infections, and help patients breathe while they recover from the virus which causes a disease known as Covid-19.

“Because of the huge demand, this machine is now almost impossible to get even if you have money to buy. The waiting list with producers runs into months.It’s also not something you can just produce, because of the technology and the supply of parts for it,” Masiyiwa wrote on Facebook.

Masiyiwa, through his Higher Life Foundation Zimbabwe, did not say how much the machines had been bought for, although prices have ranged wildly between US$15,000 and US$45,000 as countries compete to give their citizens a fighting chance.

Masiyiwa called on business leaders in every African country to “come together, and set up funds to buy this life-saving equipment.”

He added: “Don’t just wait for governments.”

The telecoms tycoon said the ventilators would be shipped “before the end of the month”, it is thought from China.

“This is a drop in the bucket, in terms of actual requirement, so I hope groups like mining companies, bottling groups, banks and others will follow our example. This is a not a crisis in which you ‘sit on your hands, and provide running commentary’,” Masiyiwa said, crediting his mother for the counsel.

Zimbabwe has one referral centre for coronavirus cases – Wilkins Hospital in Harare – but the facility had no ventilator until a donation a week ago.

Four thousand nurses are expected to participate in strikes across Papua New Guinea this week over concerns that the Pacific nation lacks the medical supplies and funding to handle a potential coronavirus outbreak.

The industrial action follows a sit-in by nearly 600 nurses in the capital of Port Moresby on Thursday over concerns about the lack of personal protective equipment for medical staff.

Gibson Siune, the general secretary of the PNG Nurses Association said the majority of the association’s members, which represents roughly 20% of the country’s nursing workforce, would participate in the protests for as long as it took until their concerns were heard by the national government.

“Around 4,000 nurses throughout the country are expected to participate in this protest,” he said.

The country recorded its first confirmed case of Covid-19 on 20 March, an imported case from a foreign mine worker who has since been sent to Australia for treatment. A 14-day state of emergency came into effect on Tuesday imposing a curfew on the country’s roughly eight million residents and restricting travel across the country.

The state of emergency has also imposed significant restrictions on who can speak to the media, with many doctors saying they were forbidden from discussing issues with the Guardian.

A senior doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Guardian Australia: “PNG is not prepared to fight the virus simply because it does not have the funds to do so.

“The national government must come clean on the financial front and tell the people whether there is money available to fight the coronavirus or not, because currently almost all hospitals lack basic medical supplies to attend to ordinary illnesses in the country.”

Residents in Port Moresby have also come out expressing concern about the possible shortage of food and other basic necessities in shops and markets, as the country went into lock down.

One resident told Guardian Australia: “I don’t think the lock down is a good idea, as many of our people are going into panic buying while other unfortunate ones are unable to do that now because they simply do not have the money to buy extra food and basic supplies.”

In response to the sit-in protest by nurses, prime minister James Marape gave assurances to the nurses and doctors that PPEs will be made available to them this week.

Marape has also assured Papua New Guineans that food and basic supplies will not run out and that they should not panic and that the national government is doing all it can to protect the people and ensure there are no new cases of the virus in the country.

Like other Pacific Island countries, it is fighting hard at keeping its first case at just one, while also trying to ensure there is no local transmission.

The prime minister, James Marape, said when parliament is recalled next Thursday, “two bills will be enacted as Emergency Laws and they are the proposed Emergency General Provisions Bill 2020 and the Proposed Emergency Defence Force COVID-19 Bill 2020.”

The deputy director of the PNG Institute of Medical Research, Dr Moses Laman, said the institute in Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province, is fully capable of testing for the Covid-19 as it is accredited by the World Health Organization.

“There is really no need for test samples to be further verified in Australia, however depending on the case and upon request from the National Government, samples are sent for further checks like the first confirmed case.”

Health Minister Jelta Wong said there are currently 580 testing kits available in the country, and another 4,000 will arrive over the next week.

“PCR testing equipment has arrived in Port Moresby already and is undergoing optimisation, by 1 April testing should begin with 200 tests per day. The Central Public Laboratory should come online on 8 April with another 200 tests per day, so collectively there will be 700 tests conducted per day in the country.”

The Bomana Immigration Centre is among two other facilities being considered to be used as isolation units for coronavirus cases in Port Moresby.

Four thousand nurses are expected to participate in strikes across Papua New Guinea this week over concerns that the Pacific nation lacks the medical supplies and funding to handle a potential coronavirus outbreak.

The industrial action follows a sit-in by nearly 600 nurses in the capital of Port Moresby on Thursday over concerns about the lack of personal protective equipment for medical staff.

Gibson Siune, the general secretary of the PNG Nurses Association said the majority of the association’s members, which represents roughly 20% of the country’s nursing workforce, would participate in the protests for as long as it took until their concerns were heard by the national government.

“Around 4,000 nurses throughout the country are expected to participate in this protest,” he said.

The country recorded its first confirmed case of Covid-19 on 20 March, an imported case from a foreign mine worker who has since been sent to Australia for treatment. A 14-day state of emergency came into effect on Tuesday imposing a curfew on the country’s roughly eight million residents and restricting travel across the country.

The state of emergency has also imposed significant restrictions on who can speak to the media, with many doctors saying they were forbidden from discussing issues with the Guardian.

The data does not reflect the exact number of people affected by Covid-19, since it depends on the number of people being tested.

164 people have died in the last 24 hours from coronavirus, bringing a total of 1,447 deaths from coronavirus in Belgium.

However, for the first time, the number of people who left hospital in a day was greater than the number of new coronavirus patient admissions.

In the past 24 hours, 504 people were allowed to leave hospital and 499 were hospitalised, according to the national public health institute of Belgium, Sciensano’s daily report records.

Hospital admissions are seen by experts as the most reliable indicator of the progress of the disease in the population, and the fall in new admissions suggests that confinement measures are beginning to have an effect.

The institute adds that a total of 5,735 hospital beds in Belgium are occupied, 57 in the last 24 hours, including 1,261 in intensive care, an increase of only 16 since yesterday.

Update: The number of patients confirmed with the new coronavirus (Covid-19) in Belgium is 20,814, as of Monday 6 April. Read more about it here.

Cuban official media reported Wednesday night that three Italian tourists are the first confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the island.

According to a statement by the Ministry of Health, the tourists arrived in Cuba on March 9 and were staying at a hostel in Trinidad, a city east of Havana. A fourth Italian traveler was tested but the results were negative.

They were all in isolation at the Pedro Kourí Tropical Medicine Institute in Havana, where the tests were carried out.

The Ministry said that the three patients were recovering favorably. Seven Cubans identified “as contacts” are being watched at a hospital in the Sancti Spiritus province, but had shown no symptoms.

The Italians affected by the coronavirus arrived in the country through the Havana airport.

This week, Cuban leader Miguel Díaz-Canel had reviewed the country’s plan to prevent and treat the disease, and state media were telling Cubans to wash their hands.

But people on the island wonder how, since essential hygiene products like soap are scarce. State media have also acknowledged that there is a shortage of medications. However, the Ministry said the country was prepared to deal with the coronavirus threat with 3,000 hospital beds in hospitals and 100 beds in intensive care units.

On Tuesday, health authorities had said that so far, 30 travelers had been admitted at the Tropical Medicine Institute and that they had tested 18 for coronavirus, all negative.

The government has not announced travel restrictions.

On Wednesday, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, a global pandemic. In Latin America, there are more than 160 cases registered in at least 12 countries, and two people have died.

Zanmi Lasante says the group’s decision comes after “much consideration” and after weeks of waiting, to no avail, on the Ministry of Public Health and Population. It had asked health officials for authorization to use a 15-minute rapid test that can detect antibodies in the blood to confirm current or past exposure to COVID-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus.

“We have a moral obligation to battle this virus and do the best that we can for the people of Haiti,” said Elizabeth Campa, senior health and policy adviser for Zanmi Lasante. “As such, we will begin using the rapid test as a screening mechanism at our health facilities and at the border.”

On Monday, Haitian health officials reported that they now have 24 confirmed cases of the respiratory disease and said the country’s first death, a 55-year-old man with no travel history and underlying health issues was confirmation of community transmission. Globally the disease has infected nearly 1.3 million, killed 70,000 people and sent billions to shutter themselves at home.

Compared to the neighboring Dominican Republic, which has tested more than 4,000 people and registered 1,488 positive COVID-19 cases and 68 deaths, Haiti has only administered 257 tests. The issue of testing has led for calls for the ministry to much more quickly identify people who have the flu-like virus.

This is not the first time that Zanmi Lasante, which runs the 320-bed University Hospital in Mirebalais under the guidance of renowned medical anthropologist and infectious disease expert Dr. Paul Farmer, has been willing to go out on a limb in the name of the Haitian population during its 30-year-plus existence.

Similar decisions about screenings and treatment were made by the nonprofit healthcare provider in the ‘80s and ‘90s in regard to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and in the past decade in response to the cholera epidemic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

The University Hospital in Mirebalais is one of the few health facilities in Haiti currently equipped to care for patients sickened by the coronavirus, and received Haiti’s first two positive COVID-19 patients, both of whom have since recovered. It also runs other healthcare facilities and works on the Haiti-Dominican border, where thousands of Haitians have crossed unchecked since both nations closed the border last month to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Campa said Zanmi Lasante is aware that “the gold standard” remains the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR test, which is more accurate but much slower and can take days to get results. Any positive cases found through the 15-minute rapid test will then be transferred over for PCR testing, she said.

Doctors divided about benefits of rapid testing

The use of rapid testing in the battle to stop the spread of COVID-19 remains a divisive one among clinicians and public health specialists. During Monday’s coronavirus briefing in Port-au-Prince, Dr. Patrick Dely, who is responsible for the ministry’s epidemiology and laboratory section, addressed the rapid testing debate.

“Every country adopts measures that goes with their reality; their means and the resources they have, ” Dely said. “Your response cannot be based on what you see others are doing.”

Dely said there are three types of tests that can be done to detect the coronavirus. But given the studies on both the rapid antibody and antigen tests, the country runs the risk of missing 40 percent of positive cases with a false negative result. Haiti, he said, has chosen to go the more accurate route of the polymerase chain reaction, which only its National Laboratory is currently entrusted to do. The lab he said, has the capacity to run about 800 tests a day.

Not everyone agrees with this direction. Reginald Boulos, a Haitian businessman and physician with a master’s in public health, said given the reality of the country and the ministry’s own admission that Haiti now has community transmission, “it’s unrealistic to think that we can continue to do” the PCR tests

The country, he said, needs to employ the South Korea model, where face masks in public are mandatory and the crisis is being managed by “testing, testing testing” with a rapid antigen test. Unlike the antibody tests Zanmi Lasante plans to use to show the prevalence of the disease in communities, Boulos believes the antigen test provides more accuracy.

“We need to change approach; coronavirus cannot be a clinical approach and this is what we’re doing right now. We need a public health approach in Haiti; not just a clinician to have a nice laboratory being able to do 200 tests after three weeks. What does that say for a country with 10 million people?” Boulos said. “We are not testing the country. We aren’t really testing the people who we should be testing. People don’t even know where to go and get tested.”

More testing coming in Haiti

Boulos said the Association of Automotive Importers recently donated $80,000 to expand testing in Haiti and increase the number of beds for COVID-19 patients. The donation went to GHESKIO, a research, treatment and training facility in Port-au-Prince, which had been seeking $200,000 for its COVID-19 response.

“We made one condition: to increase the 1,000 tests to 2,500 and [Dr. William Pape] has agreed to that,” GHESKIO said.

Pape, the founder of GHESKIO, confirmed the donation, which he said will not go toward the purchase of rapid tests but the more accurate PCR tests.

The rapid test “is a catastrophe,” said Pape, who is a member of the scientific committee put in place by Haitian President Jovenel Moïse on the country’s COVID-19 response.

“If they were used we would hospitalize many patients who do not need to occupy unnecessary beds. At the same time, we would tell people who are infected that they are not and they would go around infecting others.” Pape said. “The PCR test we are using is very accurate.”

Pape said the ministry of health is right to follow the WHO/PAHO recommendations to only test people documented by a trained epidemiologist to have signs and symptoms of COVID-19.

“The nurse performing the test is highly exposed and must be properly protected, trained and certified. This is the best strategy when you have limited testing kits,” he said.

The Ministry of Health, Pape said, has ordered more test kits but they are not available for sale outside the U.S. Kits approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been ordered from South Korea, but the real issue is that test kits are sold separately from extraction agents, which are essential to conduct the test. There is a global shortage of extraction agents.

In addition to the donation by the Haitian private sector, Pape said the dean of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York “has graciously collected for us all extraction agents from their research labs” as well as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.

“This should all arrive early this week to increase tremendously our capacity to perform tests in Haiti,” he said. “Many more testing sites are being set up.”","['257 tests', '200 tests', '800 tests', '1,000 tests']",,,

Zanmi Lasante, which is a sister group of Boston-based Partners In Health, responded to a call for increased and faster testing in the country after a request to health officials there to authorize a 15-minute test went unanswered.

“We have a moral obligation to battle this virus and do the best that we can for the people of Haiti,” said Elizabeth Campa, Zanmi Lasante’s senior health and policy adviser told the Miami Herald. “As such, we will begin using the rapid test as a screening mechanism at our health facilities and at the border.”

Health officials in Haiti reported 24 cases of novel coronavirus. Its first death reported Monday, was a 55-year-old man who had no history of travel or underlying health issues, which confirmed community transmission.



The number of cases is low, compared to neighboring country, the Dominican Republic, which has reported 1,488 cases and 68 deaths. But that is likely because of the low number of tests administered. The Dominican Republic has tested more than 4,000 people, while Haiti has only tested 257 people.



However, Dr. Patrick Dely, director of Haiti’s Department of Laboratory and Research Epidemiology, questioned the effectiveness of rapid testing, saying a risk still exists..



“Every country adopts measures that goes with their reality; their means and the resources they have, ” Dely said, noting that 40 percent of positives could be missed. “Your response cannot be based on what you see others are doing.”



Zanmi Lasante’s plan is to employ rapid testing, then transfer those tests over for polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, tests, which are more accurate, but can take days for results.

But continuing PCR tests only is counterproductive given what Haiti is facing, said Reginald Boulos, a doctor who is also a businessman and former president of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He believes the rapid testing model would work.

“We need to change approach; coronavirus cannot be a clinical approach and this is what we’re doing right now,” Boulos told the Herald. “We need a public health approach in Haiti; not just a clinician to have a nice laboratory being able to do 200 tests after three weeks.

The hospital’s medical director, Dr. Jean Venèse Joseph, said the final straw was when it took government officials 48 hours to test a 70-year-old patient with pneumonia for COVID-19, and staff realized they had neither the equipment nor medical gear to confront the highly contagious respiratory disease.

“You can imagine the panic that took place inside the hospital,” he said in a telephone interview from Port-au-Prince. “We realized that we are not prepared to confront the reality that exists.”

Private hospitals and nonprofit healthcare providers like the 60-bed French Hospital are the backbone of Haiti’s healthcare system. But those key players say they’re being undermined by the Ministry of Public Health and Population, which is leading the national response to the pandemic.

Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal

According to some healthcare providers in Haiti, the government is dragging its feet on everything from allowing rapid testing to contact tracing to involving non-government healthcare facilities in its response.

Haiti’s official statistics tell a troubling story. The nation of 11 million has so far only tested 218 people for the deadly coronavirus and has 20 confirmed positive cases. By comparison, the Dominican Republic, which has roughly the same population as Haiti, has run more than 4,000 tests, and reported 1,488 positive cases and 68 deaths. It has also said it’s seeing community transmission.

Dr. Franck Généus, the head of the country’s association of private hospitals, said the decision by the French Hospital is a sign of things to come if the government doesn’t get its act together. He has publicly accused the ministry of not doing enough to involve private hospitals in its COVID-19 response plan.

“In two, three weeks, the health care system in Haiti will be brought to its knees,” Généus said.

For weeks, nonprofits like Zanmi Lasante, which runs the country’s largest functioning hospital, the 320-bed University Hospital of Mirebalais, and Innovating Health International, have been asking the ministry whether they can use 15-minute rapid tests to help detect COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the flu-like virus. So far they have received no response even though both have access to testing kits.

“Haiti desperately needs testing and rapid testing because half of all cases are asymptomatic,” said Dr. Vincent DeGennaro, founder of Innovating Health International. “The USA failed miserably in testing and understanding our epidemic. We can’t let Haiti repeat those mistakes. Rapid tests should be used for screening and surveillance, neither or which is practical or feasible with swab tests.”

The issue of rapid testing remains controversial, with some doctors arguing that the lack of accuracy and knowledge over how and when to use them could create more problems than they solve. Others say that given that a significant portion of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, rapid testing allows for massive screenings of the population and for quickly detecting the depth of the epidemic in the population.

Ashley Baldwin, a spokeswoman with the Pan American Health Organization, said rapid testing still “needs to be evaluated and is not currently recommended for clinical diagnosis pending more evidence on test performance and operational utility.”

But some countries are using the tests in order to try to figure out the prevalence of the disease in their societies. Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Dominican Republic’s Ministry of Health, said the country has a stock of 12,000 rapid tests for the coronavirus. While not relying on them as the principal diagnostic tool, health officials are hoping they will have some use monitoring and controlling the spread of the outbreak.

Since they first received the rapid tests on March 27, they’ve been using them on first responders who have already been tested using the slower but more accurate polymerase chain reaction tests.

“Starting Saturday we’re rolling them out nationally and concentrating on the hot spots,” he said.

Dr. Lauré Adrien, the director general of Haiti’s Ministry of Public Health and Population, said officials are proceeding cautiously for a reason. The ministry wants to be careful so Haiti doesn’t end up with a batch of counterfeit tests, which have already been identified in Spain.

The ministry, he said, is willing to go the route of rapid massive screenings, but “it is first necessary to ensure the specificity, the sensitivity,” and accuracy of the tests.

“It’s a new virus, therefore with new tests, we must be vigilant,” Adrien said. “In addition we must also ensure the ability of laboratories to perform reliable (quality control). We hope very soon to have more tests and especially more screening points in the country.”

Adrien pushed back on criticism by Généus and others that private institutions are not part of the response. Généus, he said, “knows that the response plan includes everyone” and has been part of the meetings as head of the association of private hospitals.

Adrien said some private hospitals in Haiti have an expectation that the health ministry will be giving personal protective equipment to everyone. But this will not be the case. The government first needs to know which hospitals are in position to receive and care for COVID-19 patients, and then the institutions need to provide an inventory of their needs.

“The country does not have a huge amount of PPE; our orders are not yet fully met,” he said.

Haiti, which recently ordered $18 million in medical equipment and gear from China, according to its prime minister, will distribute the equipment as soon as it is available, Adrien said.

He said another problem with the private hospitals in the country is that while they have nurses and administrative staff, they rarely have doctors assigned to them, further complicating care and the ability to respond to the pandemic.

“These hospitals must also tell us how many nursing staff they have and the estimate of their needs,” said Adrien. “We must know the operations of private hospitals in Haiti. ... The state does not want to repeat the experience that private hospitals lived after the [2010] earthquake where most were decapitalized or even closed. So we need a support plan and to ensure the feasibility and compliance with this plan.”

But time remains of the essence, say healthcare workers in Haiti. Even before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the hemisphere, Haiti was already facing challenges with its weak health system. Ten years after the deadly earthquake that killed more than 300,000 Haitians, the largest public hospital still hasn’t been completed and most of the existing public facilities are poorly equipped. Strikes are also a common occurrence.

The health ministry, meanwhile, has been criticized for its lack of transparency in relaying the information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and whether they are travel related or community spread. It has also been slow on contact tracing — a key component in stopping the spread of the virus.

Last week, for example, two people were finally contacted almost two weeks after returning from Miami to be told that fellow airline passengers tested positive for the virus and they needed to be screened.

The day after the phone calls, the mayors of one of the most populated suburbs, Carrefour, took to the radio to blast health authorities after a pastor, who tested positive after arriving from Miami, fled one region of the country amid threats and showed up in his city with nine family members. The health ministry, Carrefour Mayor Jude Edouard Pierre said, needs to do a better job of inclusion.","['4,000 tests']",,,

By Jeb Sprague and Nazaire St. Fort

Featured image: With N95 respirator masks unavailable, a Haitian woman wears a mask made from a plantain leaf.

Haitian President Jovenel Moïse announced on March 19 that two citizens in Haiti had tested positive for Covid-19, known popularly simply as the coronavirus. The government has closed Haiti’s border, ports, and airports to the movement of people but kept supply chains open. Only a small number of tests have been administered, and there are rising fears that a health catastrophe will unfold over the coming weeks and months.

News and commentaries inside the country spread quickly over WhatsApp and local media. Under mounting stress, many know they are wholly unprepared for a pandemic that has also arrived in other Caribbean countries, including the neighboring Dominican Republic.

The latest reports indicate that 859 people have tested positive in the Dominican Republic, with 39 deaths already. One of the country’s main hospitals in the second largest city, Santiago de los Caballeros, reportedly no longer has beds available.

Many families in Haiti have relatives residing in the Dominican Republic and receive updates regularly. The virus appears to have initially been brought to Haiti through Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. Since the first two cases, the official number rose to 15 by March 30, although that figure is surely an undercount. Dozens have been placed under quarantine.

Haiti now faces a looming pandemic with an almost non-existent public healthcare system, and with a dysfunctional political system rooted in neocolonial intervention.

The Caribbean region has endured four centuries of slavery and colonialism and a fifth century of economic dependence. Accelerating globalization and technological developments have brought profound change to the region over the past 20 years, including no-cost digital communications, hi-tech remittance networks, low-cost mass travel and tourism, and new banking and financial arrangements. But it has also brought soaring inequality and climate shocks, mainly in the form of hurricanes and rising sea-levels.

Globalization and automation have caused billions of people to be cast into capitalism’s surplus population. Under this system’s relentless logic, vast portions of the world’s people, even entire countries like Haiti, are condemned to rampant crime, unemployment, and inflation, alongside disintegrating infrastructure and government services. It sinks destructively into the social fabric of society.

To preserve social order and the neoliberal conception of “good governance,” Western institutions resort to severe austerity measures and military intervention, further debilitating the neo-colony whose economic life-blood is being sucked out to enrich the transnational bourgeoisie.

This is the recipe that rendered Haiti completely unprepared for the Coronavirus pandemic.

The stark reality of Haiti

Unemployment in Haiti is already sky-high. With 6 million of Haiti’s 11 million citizens living below the poverty line of $2.41 a day, according to the World Bank, most will face a grueling dilemma of how to feed themselves and their families while avoiding virus infection.

Dr. John A. Carroll, who has worked in clinics, hospitals, and orphanages in Haiti since 1995, explained, “There is no treatment in Haiti that will be accessible by the masses. But there is quarantine to stop transmission. But how do we isolate people in the Haitian slum where the population density is so high and people need to have human contact in order to survive?”

“The breadwinners in the house need to score some bread because they all need to eat,” Carroll continued. “And this family’s neighbors next door don’t have the time or abilities to help out because they have equally severe challenges surviving the slum also.“

While the Haitian government is officially promoting confinement and social distancing, the stark reality is that most of the population are likely heading toward collective “herd immunity,” where many must choose to get infected in the street rather than die by hunger at home. Some, like Carroll, think that this steep, as opposed to flattened, infection curve will result in fewer deaths.

Building “herd immunity” is an approach that the UK government actually suggested for its own people weeks ago, but quickly rejected as a result of a fierce public backlash. Instead, the British state has imposed “social distancing” measures and — despite a right-wing government being in office — committed to pay the majority of the payroll costs of businesses whose workers stay home.

On March 29, local medical experts interviewed on Radio Kiskeya, one of the country’s most important radio stations, suggested that up to 800,000 Haitians could perish from the virus. Large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to avert such a catastrophe.

The Grayzone spoke with Dr. Ernst Noël, of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMP) in Port-au-Prince, who stated that the number of 800,000 is not an exaggeration. In his view, many people will likely die due to Coronavirus, and in larger numbers than those that perished in the 2010 earthquake.

He added that large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to soften the blow of the oncoming disaster.

Teetering on the edge of a meltdown

It would be an understatement to say that Haiti’s health-care system is ill-prepared for the looming catastrophe.

According to Haiti’s National Institute of Statistics, the country has only 911 doctors. A mere 4.4 percent of the national budget is allocated for national health, which translates to ill-equipped hospitals with woefully insufficient staff. State-run hospitals often face labor strikes, and some medical staff appear not to be showing up to work, as they are lacking masks, gloves, and gowns and fear contracting the virus.

According to Haiti’s most read newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, the country has only 130 ICU beds, and most of these are older models.

Dr. Paul Farmer, a co-founder of the Boston-based health care organization Partners in Health, has suggested Haiti may actually have fewer than 30 fully functioning ICU beds.

Meanwhile there are an estimated 64 ventilators inside the country, though some are likely not working.

Dr. Farmer has pointed out how people living in the Global South face significantly more risk due to underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure:

“All these mechanics of a hospital, we [in affluent nations] don’t have to deal with them. The oxygen is piped right into every room. But the dread of responsibility for my coworkers in Haiti is that they have to worry: Where do we get the oxygen, the IV solutions, can we space the beds for intensive or supportive care in a way that doesn’t infect the caregivers? And we’ve exhausted a lot of supplies as health-care workers are more attentive to putting on gloves, changing gloves, gowning up. We’re seeing real supply chain challenges.”

Doctors assigned to the State University of Haiti (HUEH), the country’s biggest medical facility, have reportedly barely escaped from a suspected Covid-19 outbreak. They had not received personal protection equipment, nor did they get the test kits prescribed for testing coronavirus patients. Even running water is lacking in some medical facilities.

Dr. Ulysse Samuel serves at an external HUEH clinic receiving outpatients. He explained to The Grayzone that before the Covid-19 pandemic he had “never seen ventilators at the HUEH facility,” and now, as a wave of cases threatens to swamp the hospital, ”I have no idea if there are any.”

After years of foreign intervention and neoliberal structural adjustment, Haiti has been forced into a desperate situation where it has little choice but to rely on international funds during periods of catastrophe.

As of 2013, 64 percent of Haiti’s health budget was derived from international assistance, according to Dr. Georges Dubuche of the country’s Ministry of Public Health and Population. The percentage has remained high.

As Dr. Carroll warns, “Haiti does not have a functional health care system on a good day let alone a system that can effectively fight this virus.”

The Inter-American Development Bank has thus far committed $50 million to the Coronavirus response. The IMF is also apparently considering an unprecedented influx of reserve assets for developing countries.

Haiti is one of 50 desperate countries that will have split between them some part of a recently launched $2 billion UN plan, but that will take time to materialize.

US-blockaded Cuba, whose medical teams have been heavily active in Haiti since 1998, has dispatched a brigade of 348 doctors and other health specialists to help fight the coronavirus.

Some important private and donor-backed medical clinics do exist, such as the Partners in Health-run hospital in Mirebalais. It is apparently one of the first major medical institutions that has been proactively testing for Covid-19. A variety of NGOs and smaller health-oriented groups have scrambled to prepare and educate people about the pandemic.

At UniFA, the University of the Aristide Foundation, in a Port-au-Prince suburb called Tabarre, the medical school has just begun to graduate students who are required to practice inside the country. In March, the university graduated its first 138 students. Among its faculty have been teachers from Cuba.

As its website explains, the “medical school graduates are currently fulfilling their one-year government mandated social service residency in health care centers across the country. In many instances, these young professionals are the only health care providers for the entire community.”

Factories in Port-au-Prince were closed on March 20th. Most were assembling clothes and electronics for export. A few factories may soon be overhauled to produce things like surgical masks. For common people seeking to take precautions, one surgical mask costs approximately 50 Gourdes (about $0.53) but these are very hard to find.

Some business groups active in Haiti are beginning to prepare, including an association of Chinese enterprises.

To compound the problem, under the corruption-stained Moïse government, the country’s National Office of Old Age Insurance (OFNAC) has been grievously mismanaged. Funds for the elderly have been delayed or cut, further endangering those most at risk from the coronavirus.

Responding to the calamity ahead

Will the quarantine ordered by the Moïse government be ultimately seen as a hollow act of grand-standing? It is in large part not being enforced, and it’s not clear if it even can be, given people’s day-to-day struggle for survival.

Haiti’s government has put forward a preparation and response plan with an estimated $37.2 million budget, but it’s unclear how effective it can be. Local and international organizations have been meeting to coordinate a response.

One street vendor woman (known as a “Ti Marchan”) said in an interview with Haiti’s Island TV that the present confinement is intolerable. Needing to earn money to feed up to eight family members, she exclaimed that she would rather be infected with the virus than not work, since her sole daily livelihood was now being taken away.

Many are asking if Haiti’s government will be able to secure basic food staples to feed the majority of the population, as large parts of the population live on just a few dollars a day or less and are now being pressured to isolate themselves and not work.

The Haitian government has announced food distribution measures for some districts, and this comes as the prices of some basic food staples has increased in recent months and the currency has rapidly depreciated.

By comparison, in the nearby Dominican Republic, state officials have announced on national television that the nation’s poorest sectors will receive financial aid for food purchases through the government’s “solidarity debit cards.” They will start receiving an increase of 5,000 Pesos (about US$92) monthly, starting on April 1 and running through the end of May. The Dominican Republic has become one of the largest locations for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Caribbean and is among the region’s top tourist hotspots, so the government has many more resources to deal with such a crisis.

The first cases of Covid-19 in the Dominican Republic were officially acknowledged by its Health Ministry in late February. The Dominican government, meanwhile, has begun to take drastic measures such as a suspension of flights from Europe, a 5 PM to 6 AM curfew which may turn into a draconian 24-hour lockdown with exceptions for grocery shopping, buying prescriptions, and other necessary excursions.

Haiti is the Dominican Republic’s number two export market after the US, and is heavily dependent upon Dominican exports for basic food staples such as rice, as well as manufactured consumer items. Thus, anything that impacts the Dominican Republic eventually affects life in Haiti.

A number of Haitian migrant workers appear to have fled back to the country to be with family. Others, whose economic survival depends on daily migrant labor, have no choice but to find illicit ways to cross back and forth across the border.

A large part of the Haitian population is clearly aware of the real dangers posed by the coronavirus, but at the same time many confess they have no choice but to gain their daily livelihoods through the usual improvised and informal activities in the small scale economy. The overwhelming majority of these workers are forced to take very crowded public transportation to their workplaces.

As the virus hits countries worldwide, it is unlikely foreign governments will be able to marshal the Herculean support that Haiti needs. Haiti spends just $13 per capita on healthcare, compared to $180 by the Dominican Republic, and $781 in Cuba.

Confusion reigns. Some Haitians have criticized recent moves by the government to push thousands of people to line up for national IDs, after officials declared the cards will be required to receive aid during the pandemic.

Meanwhile a kidnapping wave has traumatized people in Haiti, even affecting the transportation sector bringing in goods from the Dominican Republic.

A protest movement pauses and hospital director is kidnapped

The situation is made more difficult by the ongoing political crisis. Moïse now governs without parliament after failing to hold elections, and had been facing a mass uprising threatening to chase him from office. Strong diplomatic support from the US has been the linchpin allowing his tenuous political survival.

The coronavirus though has put a pause on the giant anti-government protests that occurred throughout late 2019 and into early 2020. Yet these will undoubtedly return given how sharply the inhuman essence of neoliberal capitalism in Haiti and elsewhere has been exposed by the current crisis.

As massive protests against the US-backed Moïse rocked Haiti throughout 2019, and his government struck back by hiring violent paramilitaries to crack down, the Bernard Mevs Hospital went into debt treating hundreds of wounded demonstrators for free.

This March, while Covid-19 bore down on Haiti, the hospital’s director, Dr. Jerry Bitar, was kidnapped. Hospital staff refused to take in new patients until Bitar was freed, leading to his release on March 27.

In the 21st century, Haitians have experienced one ordeal after another. Estimates of deaths from the January 12, 2010 earthquake range from 46,000 to 160,000 people, while many more were wounded and up to a million were displaced. The country has yet to recover from these tragedies, with many survivors still trapped tent cities.

Haiti has also survived a cholera outbreak which killed close to 10,000 and sickened over 800,000. UN occupation troops were found to have caused the epidemic through their negligence, and a campaign demanding reparations from the UN continues.

The country has also suffered several devastating hurricanes, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which extensively ravaged Haiti’s southern peninsula, wiping out crops and coastal towns.

US-imposed right-wing governments set the stage for another disaster

Haiti’s population faces the coronavirus pandemic after a series of man-made crises that set the backdrop for the coming crisis.

First, there were the 1991 and 2004 coup d’états, both US-backed schemes that sought to roll-back popular gains made after historic turnouts at the polls by Jean Bertrand Aristide’s leftist Lavalas movement.

In the 2010-2011 elections, Washington intervened through the Organization of American States (OAS) to effectively change the electoral results and install the right-wing pop singer Michel “Sweet Micky” Martelly, ushering in a decade of US puppet regimes.

Martelly’s successor, Moïse, appears to have pocketed millions of dollars stolen from funds meant to help build up the country through Venezuela’s PetroCaribe program. Funds from PetroCaribe have been used by many Caribbean states to plug budget shortfalls and invest in important infrastructure.

Moïse is officially mentioned 69 times in the recent corruption report produced by the State Administrative Court and is considered one of the principal beneficiaries, both politically and financially, of the Petrocaribe funds corruption scheme.

In response to protests, the Haitian government and its allies have also turned to violent repression against popular neighborhoods where anti-government sentiments run high.

US-backed Haitian government agents accused of conducting massacre By @JebSpraguehttps://t.co/mCCl3jCvKA — The Canary US (@TheCanaryUS) December 20, 2018

Instead of investing in healthcare, the government has increasingly sought to strengthen its repressive capabilities.

With the support of planners at the Inter-American Defense Board, the Moïse government has begun rebuilding the military, which was disbanded in 1995. Historically, the Haitian military has symbolized repression of the popular will, presiding over numerous coups, massacres, and counter-insurgency campaigns to guarantee the Washington consensus.

As Jake Johnson of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) has written, “The Inter-American Defense Board, a body of the OAS, developed a ‘white paper’ in July [of 2015] focused on reinstating a Haitian defense force with the support of the UN.”

By 2018, Haiti’s new army had six personnel being trained at the US military’s School of the Americas (SOA), which was renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).

In March, the Haitian government disseminated a snappily produced public relations video on Whatsapp that portrayed soldiers distributing bags of rice to the doors of people’s ramshackle homes.

In February 2020, however, the newly reconstituted military engaged in a deadly clash with police officers in Port-au-Prince who had been locked in a labor dispute with the government. The conflict illustrated the fundamental purpose of the country’s military, which has always been loyal to the country’s political right-wing, and whose existence was sustained for the purpose of internal repression.

Battered by years of man-made and natural disasters, Haiti faces another historical ordeal with few resources to shoulder it. Sidelined and repressed by a US-imposed political apparatus, the poor majority will bear the brunt of the coronavirus.

By Jeb Sprague and Nazaire St. Fort

The Grayzone

Haitian President Jovenel Moïse announced on March 19 that two citizens in Haiti had tested positive for Covid-19, known popularly simply as the coronavirus. The government has closed Haiti’s border, ports, and airports to the movement of people but kept supply chains open. Only a small number of tests have been administered, and there are rising fears that a health catastrophe will unfold over the coming weeks and months.

News and commentaries inside the country spread quickly over WhatsApp and local media. Under mounting stress, many know they are wholly unprepared for a pandemic that has also arrived in other Caribbean countries, including the neighboring Dominican Republic.

The latest reports indicate that there are 1380 cases in the Dominican Republic, with 60 deaths already. One of the country’s main hospitals in the second largest city, Santiago de los Caballeros, reportedly no longer has beds available.

Many families in Haiti have relatives residing in the Dominican Republic and receive updates regularly. The virus appears to have initially been brought to Haiti through Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. Since the first two cases, the official number rose to 15 by March 30, although that figure is surely an undercount. Dozens have been placed under quarantine.

Haiti now faces a looming pandemic with an almost non-existent public healthcare system, and with a dysfunctional political system rooted in neocolonial intervention.

The Caribbean region has endured four centuries of slavery and colonialism and a fifth century of economic dependence. Accelerating globalization and technological developments have brought profound change to the region over the past 20 years, including no-cost digital communications, hi-tech remittance networks, low-cost mass travel and tourism, and new banking and financial arrangements. But it has also brought soaring inequality and climate shocks, mainly in the form of hurricanes and rising sea-levels.

Globalization and automation have caused billions of people to be cast into capitalism’s surplus population. Under this system’s relentless logic, vast portions of the world’s people, even entire countries like Haiti, are condemned to rampant crime, unemployment, and inflation, alongside disintegrating infrastructure and government services. It sinks destructively into the social fabric of society.

To preserve social order and the neoliberal conception of “good governance,” Western institutions resort to severe austerity measures and military intervention, further debilitating the neo-colony whose economic life-blood is being sucked out to enrich the transnational bourgeoisie.

This is the recipe that rendered Haiti completely unprepared for the Coronavirus pandemic.

Stark Realities

Unemployment in Haiti is already sky-high. With 6 million of Haiti’s 11 million citizens living below the poverty line of $2.41 a day, according to the World Bank, most will face a grueling dilemma of how to feed themselves and their families while avoiding virus infection.

Dr. John A. Carroll, who has worked in clinics, hospitals, and orphanages in Haiti since 1995, explained, “There is no treatment in Haiti that will be accessible by the masses. But there is quarantine to stop transmission. But how do we isolate people in the Haitian slum where the population density is so high and people need to have human contact in order to survive?”

“The breadwinners in the house need to score some bread because they all need to eat,” Carroll continued. “And this family’s neighbors next door don’t have the time or abilities to help out because they have equally severe challenges surviving the slum also.”

While the Haitian government is officially promoting confinement and social distancing, the stark reality is that most of the population are likely heading toward collective “herd immunity,” where many must choose to get infected in the street rather than die by hunger at home. Some, like Carroll, think that this steep, as opposed to flattened, infection curve will result in fewer deaths.

Building “herd immunity” is an approach that the U.K. government actually suggested for its own people weeks ago, but quickly rejected as a result of a fierce public backlash. Instead, the British state has imposed “social distancing” measures and — despite a right-wing government being in office — committed to pay the majority of the payroll costs of businesses whose workers stay home.

On March 29, local medical experts interviewed on Radio Kiskeya, one of the country’s most important radio stations, suggested that up to 800,000 Haitians could perish from the virus. Large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to avert such a catastrophe.

The Grayzone spoke with Dr. Ernst Noël, of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMP) in Port-au-Prince, who stated that the number of 800,000 is not an exaggeration. In his view, many people will likely die due to Coronavirus, and in larger numbers than those that perished in the 2010 earthquake.

He added that large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to soften the blow of the oncoming disaster.

Edge of Meltdown

It would be an understatement to say that Haiti’s health-care system is ill-prepared for the looming catastrophe.

According to Haiti’s National Institute of Statistics, the country has only 911 doctors. A mere 4.4 percent of the national budget is allocated for national health, which translates to ill-equipped hospitals with woefully insufficient staff.

US-Imposed Governments Set Stage for Disaster

Haiti’s population faces the coronavirus pandemic after a series of man-made crises that set the backdrop for the coming crisis.

First, there were the 1991 and 2004 coup d’états, both U.S.-backed schemes that sought to roll-back popular gains made after historic turnouts at the polls by Jean Bertrand Aristide’s leftist Lavalas movement.

In the 2010-2011 elections, Washington intervened through the Organization of American States (OAS) to effectively change the electoral results and install the right-wing pop singer Michel “Sweet Micky” Martelly, ushering in a decade of U.S. puppet regimes.

Martelly’s successor, Moïse, appears to have pocketed millions of dollars stolen from funds meant to help build up the country through Venezuela’s PetroCaribe program. Funds from PetroCaribe have been used by many Caribbean states to plug budget shortfalls and invest in important infrastructure.

Moïse is officially mentioned 69 times in the recent corruption report produced by the State Administrative Court and is considered one of the principal beneficiaries, both politically and financially, of the Petrocaribe funds corruption scheme.

In response to protests, the Haitian government and its allies have also turned to violent repression against popular neighborhoods where anti-government sentiments run high.

Instead of investing in healthcare, the government has increasingly sought to strengthen its repressive capabilities.

With the support of planners at the Inter-American Defense Board, the Moïse government has begun rebuilding the military, which was disbanded in 1995. Historically, the Haitian military has symbolized repression of the popular will, presiding over numerous coups, massacres, and counter-insurgency campaigns to guarantee the Washington consensus.

As Jake Johnson of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) has written, “The Inter-American Defense Board, a body of the OAS, developed a ‘white paper’ in July [of 2015] focused on reinstating a Haitian defense force with the support of the UN.”

By 2018, Haiti’s new army had six personnel being trained at the U.S. military’s School of the Americas (SOA), which was renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).

In March, the Haitian government disseminated a snappily produced public relations video on Whatsapp that portrayed soldiers distributing bags of rice to the doors of people’s ramshackle homes.

In February 2020, however, the newly reconstituted military engaged in a deadly clash with police officers in Port-au-Prince who had been locked in a labor dispute with the government. The conflict illustrated the fundamental purpose of the country’s military, which has always been loyal to the country’s political right-wing, and whose existence was sustained for the purpose of internal repression.

Battered by years of man-made and natural disasters, Haiti faces another historical ordeal with few resources to shoulder it. Sidelined and repressed by a US-imposed political apparatus, the poor majority will bear the brunt of the coronavirus.

On March 19, Haitian president Jovenel Moïse confirmed the first two cases of the novel coronavirus in Haiti. The number has since increased to eight. In response, the president has declared a state of emergency and ordered schools, factories, and religious entities to close; established a curfew; and closed the country’s borders. The government announced the new policies after previously suspending air travel from most countries.

The initial reported cases both related to individuals who had traveled internationally. There has, however, only been limited local testing. As of March 25, 58 tests had been administered nationwide, according to the latest epidemiological update. The Ministry of Health has outlined a plan to combat the pandemic in Haiti, estimating a budget of $37.2 million. Already, international and local organizations have been meeting to coordinate the response.

After nearly two years of sustained protests and government inaction, the economic situation in Haiti has already made life exceedingly difficult for the vast majority of the population. The currency has rapidly depreciated, inflation has remained elevated, and the government has been unable to increase revenues domestically or through international assistance. The Haitian government has few fiscal resources to draw upon in responding to the coronavirus pandemic, and Haitian families, many already pushed to the edge, are facing an increasingly perilous future.

There are multiple complementary aspects of the response to this virus in Haiti. One centers on the health care system and the ability to adequately detect, treat, and contain the virus. The other relates to the government’s ability to establish and enforce policies that encourage physical distancing. In addressing the latter, it is important to consider how the Haitian population interacts, lives, and survives in order to implement effective policies to contain the virus, protect the population, and ensure access to essential goods.

The cases reported have so far been marked as imported, but with the difficulties of enforcing a sustained national quarantine, Haiti is facing the very real risk of COVID-19 spreading locally. While declaring a state of emergency nationwide was a necessary step, it needs to be boosted by provisions for workers and the poor, and allocations for the health care system. The international community must also play a role, with the World Bank, IMF, and other multilateral development organizations immediately freeing up resources for Haiti and other developing nations to respond to the pandemic.

The Health Care System

Prior to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Haiti’s health care system faced many challenges. According to a 2019 study by the Research and Education consortium for Acute Care in Haiti (REACH), Haiti only has an estimated 124 ICU beds and 64 ventilators for a population of more than 11 million. Other public health experts have put those figures even lower. This is a serious concern, especially given the relatively high proportion of the population considered to be at an elevated risk.

Already, there have been reports from the State University Hospital (HUEH) of inadequate preparation and supplies of protective equipment, which has led to some health professionals refusing to work. The HUEH was one of the marquee post-quake international reconstruction projects, but, more than ten years later, those plans remain mostly unrealized.

Haiti’s health care system overall is extremely reliant on private actors, including foreign assistance and NGOs. Dr. Youri Louistold the Haitian Times that, as of 2013, 64 percent of Haiti’s health budget derived from international assistance. In many parts of the country, access to health care is only provided by nonstate actors.

In such a fragmented system, coordination will be critical. In this regard, it is positive that national and international organizations are already meeting and discussing coordinated response mechanisms. Health actors in Haiti can draw upon their experiences combatting the cholera epidemic, which spread in Haiti after its introduction by United Nations troops in 2010. While the response to cholera was woefully inadequate, more coordinated and concerted efforts in recent years have led to some positive developments. As Sandra Wisner of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti told the Haitian Times, empowering communities must be a key aspect of any successful response:

This includes access and ensuring services are available to communities ― so having available where people are, tracing, treatment; health facilities resources with the necessary supplies, and ensuring front line workers have the resources and tools they need to provide safe and effective care and treatment for patients.

Since the 2010 earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Health has been one of the only government institutions that has received direct donor support. Nevertheless, a significant portion of foreign assistance bypasses national health systems. It is vitally important that efforts to respond to the current pandemic also focus on strengthening the government’s health care infrastructure. Though some improvements have been evident over the previous decade, national health spending remains woefully inadequate and has actually decreased in recent years.

The government has also appealed to Cuba for assistance in fighting the pandemic. The government announced there were 348 Cuban health professionals in the country to respond, many of whom were already in the country as part of Cuba’s decades-long assistance in providing health care in Haiti.

The Economy

Even before the arrival of the novel coronavirus, the Haitian economy was projected to shrink by 1 percent on a per capita basis in 2019. The government’s directive to close businesses will bring additional economic hardship. Remittances, on which the Haitian economy relies, may also see a reduction as diaspora communities struggle in their own communities with quarantines and business closures.

Haitians’ reliance on the informal economy will make responding to the crisis even more difficult. Some 60 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day. Though the government has directed businesses to close, the reality is that many rely on the informal economy to survive.

In this regard, despite the government’s announcements, public markets and public transportation continue to operate. Local journalists have raised concerns about the lack of guidelines for drivers and passengers. While the public might be aware of the virus, most people still depend on public transportation and public markets to survive and get around. Unions have taken the lead by recommending a reduction in the number of passengers allowed on taxis and buses, but there has yet to be any clear initiative from the state to enforce the unions’ recommendations and regulate transportation.

While the government has ordered factories closed, it is unclear what, if any, financial support from the government will go to impacted workers. Antèn Ouvriye, an organization representing factory subcontractors, has criticized the government for not ensuring salaries will continue to be paid during closures. On March 25, de facto prime minister Joseph Jouthe announced that public workers and those working in the textile industry would receive one month of wages; however, it remains unclear exactly when that would take place and how much the government will be able to afford.

In order to ensure communities are able to take action to protect themselves and are able to stay at home, the government must act to provide the resources necessary to sustain people’s livelihoods, including access to food and water. Some countries have acted to reinforce and increase government spending on essential services and social safety net policies. Some have prioritized subsidizing revenue by ensuring salaries are maintained, while others are providing meals to those who rely on daily activities for their basic needs. Although Haiti’s resources are limited, the government response needs to incorporate economic relief for the population, especially for street vendors, factory workers, and small business owners, many of whom rely on the informal economy to make a living.

The government, however, has thus far relied on monetary policy ― increasing access to credit through the central bank and relaxing repayment schedules. This, however, is likely to have only a limited impact for the vast majority of Haitians. Without greater international assistance, it is unlikely the government will have the fiscal resources available to properly support the population throughout the crisis.

Price gouging has already started, putting a strain on an already fragile population. This is partly due to the fact that the Haitian food supply depends largely on imports, which are likely to decline during the current situation. While the government has announced measures to ensure food distribution, it must make a priority of protecting consumers from price spikes. This also presents an opportunity to invest in and expand the agricultural sector, which could provide stability for farmers and sellers, and increase national production.

International Aid

It is imperative to recognize that the Haitian state’s inability to adequately respond to the crisis is tied to a legacy of foreign domination, occupation, and exploitation, and to decades of foreign aid policies that have eroded the state’s capacity. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear, as with the 2010 earthquake, that the Haitian government will not be able to adequately respond to the current crisis without increased support from the international community.

The IMF and the World Bank have issued a statement urging “all official bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments from IDA countries that request forbearance.” Though most of Haiti’s debt is concessional (loans provided at very low or even zero interest rates), bilateral and multilateral donors should immediately suspend any debt servicing requirements for the duration of the pandemic. The Inter-American Development Bank has also announced a special lending facility for countries impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

The IMF could also provide an unprecedented influx of reserve assets to developing countries, including Haiti, through a Special Drawing Rights allocation. The IMF is reportedly considering this. With its dwindling reserves and reliance on the importation of goods, such a boost would be extremely valuable to Haiti.

It is also likely that a prolonged crisis will exacerbate an already fragile food security situation in much of the country. Many children rely on school feeding programs, which are often funded by international organizations. International assistance will be key in ensuring the government is able to reach the most vulnerable in responding to the pandemic, but international actors must be wary of repeating past mistakes. Food assistance should be designed to ensure local procurement of available goods, and to support investment in national production.

The onset of the coronavirus pandemic in Haiti requires immediate and concerted action by local and international actors; but in a country where the failures of international assistance and intervention are so readily apparent, those involved in the response must make every effort to ensure a more sustainable future.

By Jeb Sprague and Nazaire St. Fort

Haitian President Jovenel Moïse announced on March 19 that two citizens in Haiti had tested positive for Covid-19, known popularly simply as the coronavirus. The government has closed Haiti’s border, ports, and airports to the movement of people but kept supply chains open. Only a small number of tests have been administered, and there are rising fears that a health catastrophe will unfold over the coming weeks and months.

News and commentaries inside the country spread quickly over WhatsApp and local media. Under mounting stress, many know they are wholly unprepared for a pandemic that has also arrived in other Caribbean countries, including the neighboring Dominican Republic.

The latest reports indicate that 859 people have tested positive in the Dominican Republic, with 39 deaths already. One of the country’s main hospitals in the second largest city, Santiago de los Caballeros, reportedly no longer has beds available.

Many families in Haiti have relatives residing in the Dominican Republic and receive updates regularly. The virus appears to have initially been brought to Haiti through Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. Since the first two cases, the official number rose to 15 by March 30, although that figure is surely an undercount. Dozens have been placed under quarantine.

Haiti now faces a looming pandemic with an almost non-existent public healthcare system, and with a dysfunctional political system rooted in neocolonial intervention.

The Caribbean region has endured four centuries of slavery and colonialism and a fifth century of economic dependence. Accelerating globalization and technological developments have brought profound change to the region over the past 20 years, including no-cost digital communications, hi-tech remittance networks, low-cost mass travel and tourism, and new banking and financial arrangements. But it has also brought soaring inequality and climate shocks, mainly in the form of hurricanes and rising sea-levels.

Globalization and automation have caused billions of people to be cast into capitalism’s surplus population. Under this system’s relentless logic, vast portions of the world’s people, even entire countries like Haiti, are condemned to rampant crime, unemployment, and inflation, alongside disintegrating infrastructure and government services. It sinks destructively into the social fabric of society.

To preserve social order and the neoliberal conception of “good governance,” Western institutions resort to severe austerity measures and military intervention, further debilitating the neo-colony whose economic life-blood is being sucked out to enrich the transnational bourgeoisie.

This is the recipe that rendered Haiti completely unprepared for the Coronavirus pandemic.

The stark reality of Haiti

Unemployment in Haiti is already sky-high. With 6 million of Haiti’s 11 million citizens living below the poverty line of $2.41 a day, according to the World Bank, most will face a grueling dilemma of how to feed themselves and their families while avoiding virus infection.

Dr. John A. Carroll, who has worked in clinics, hospitals, and orphanages in Haiti since 1995, explained, “There is no treatment in Haiti that will be accessible by the masses. But there is quarantine to stop transmission. But how do we isolate people in the Haitian slum where the population density is so high and people need to have human contact in order to survive?”

“The breadwinners in the house need to score some bread because they all need to eat,” Carroll continued. “And this family’s neighbors next door don’t have the time or abilities to help out because they have equally severe challenges surviving the slum also.“

While the Haitian government is officially promoting confinement and social distancing, the stark reality is that most of the population are likely heading toward collective “herd immunity,” where many must choose to get infected in the street rather than die by hunger at home. Some, like Carroll, think that this steep, as opposed to flattened, infection curve will result in fewer deaths.

Building “herd immunity” is an approach that the UK government actually suggested for its own people weeks ago, but quickly rejected as a result of a fierce public backlash. Instead, the British state has imposed “social distancing” measures and — despite a right-wing government being in office — committed to pay the majority of the payroll costs of businesses whose workers stay home.

On March 29, local medical experts interviewed on Radio Kiskeya, one of the country’s most important radio stations, suggested that up to 800,000 Haitians could perish from the virus. Large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to avert such a catastrophe.

The Grayzone spoke with Dr. Ernst Noël, of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMP) in Port-au-Prince, who stated that the number of 800,000 is not an exaggeration. In his view, many people will likely die due to Coronavirus, and in larger numbers than those that perished in the 2010 earthquake.

He added that large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to soften the blow of the oncoming disaster.

Teetering on the edge of a meltdown

It would be an understatement to say that Haiti’s health-care system is ill-prepared for the looming catastrophe.

According to Haiti’s National Institute of Statistics, the country has only 911 doctors. A mere 4.4 percent of the national budget is allocated for national health, which translates to ill-equipped hospitals with woefully insufficient staff. State-run hospitals often face labor strikes, and some medical staff appear not to be showing up to work, as they are lacking masks, gloves, and gowns and fear contracting the virus.

According to Haiti’s most read newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, the country has only 130 ICU beds, and most of these are older models.

Dr. Paul Farmer, a co-founder of the Boston-based health care organization Partners in Health, has suggested Haiti may actually have fewer than 30 fully functioning ICU beds.

Meanwhile there are an estimated 64 ventilators inside the country, though some are likely not working.

Dr. Farmer has pointed out how people living in the Global South face significantly more risk due to underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure:

“All these mechanics of a hospital, we [in affluent nations] don’t have to deal with them. The oxygen is piped right into every room. But the dread of responsibility for my coworkers in Haiti is that they have to worry: Where do we get the oxygen, the IV solutions, can we space the beds for intensive or supportive care in a way that doesn’t infect the caregivers? And we’ve exhausted a lot of supplies as health-care workers are more attentive to putting on gloves, changing gloves, gowning up. We’re seeing real supply chain challenges.”

Doctors assigned to the State University of Haiti (HUEH), the country’s biggest medical facility, have reportedly barely escaped from a suspected Covid-19 outbreak. They had not received personal protection equipment, nor did they get the test kits prescribed for testing coronavirus patients. Even running water is lacking in some medical facilities.

Dr. Ulysse Samuel serves at an external HUEH clinic receiving outpatients. He explained to The Grayzone that before the Covid-19 pandemic he had “never seen ventilators at the HUEH facility,” and now, as a wave of cases threatens to swamp the hospital, ”I have no idea if there are any.”

After years of foreign intervention and neoliberal structural adjustment, Haiti has been forced into a desperate situation where it has little choice but to rely on international funds during periods of catastrophe.

As of 2013, 64 percent of Haiti’s health budget was derived from international assistance, according to Dr. Georges Dubuche of the country’s Ministry of Public Health and Population. The percentage has remained high.

As Dr. Carroll warns, “Haiti does not have a functional health care system on a good day let alone a system that can effectively fight this virus.”

The Inter-American Development Bank has thus far committed $50 million to the Coronavirus response. The IMF is also apparently considering an unprecedented influx of reserve assets for developing countries.

Haiti is one of 50 desperate countries that will have split between them some part of a recently launched $2 billion UN plan, but that will take time to materialize.

US-blockaded Cuba, whose medical teams have been heavily active in Haiti since 1998, has dispatched a brigade of 348 doctors and other health specialists to help fight the coronavirus.

Haiti's government has steadily reduced national health spending in recent years. In the last approved budget, more funds were allocated to parliament than toward the health sector. https://t.co/pYrHrdhsUs pic.twitter.com/nQwUS1VLop — Jake Johnston (@JakobJohnston) March 27, 2020

Some important private and donor-backed medical clinics do exist, such as the Partners in Health-run hospital in Mirebalais. It is apparently one of the first major medical institutions that has been proactively testing for Covid-19. A variety of NGOs and smaller health-oriented groups have scrambled to prepare and educate people about the pandemic.

At UniFA, the University of the Aristide Foundation, in a Port-au-Prince suburb called Tabarre, the medical school has just begun to graduate students who are required to practice inside the country. In March, the university graduated its first 138 students. Among its faculty have been teachers from Cuba.

As its website explains, the “medical school graduates are currently fulfilling their one-year government mandated social service residency in health care centers across the country. In many instances, these young professionals are the only health care providers for the entire community.”

Factories in Port-au-Prince were closed on March 20th. Most were assembling clothes and electronics for export. A few factories may soon be overhauled to produce things like surgical masks. For common people seeking to take precautions, one surgical mask costs approximately 50 Gourdes (about $0.53) but these are very hard to find.

Some business groups active in Haiti are beginning to prepare, including an association of Chinese enterprises.

To compound the problem, under the corruption-stained Moïse government, the country’s National Office of Old Age Insurance (OFNAC) has been grievously mismanaged. Funds for the elderly have been delayed or cut, further endangering those most at risk from the coronavirus.

Responding to the calamity ahead

Will the quarantine ordered by the Moïse government be ultimately seen as a hollow act of grand-standing? It is in large part not being enforced, and it’s not clear if it even can be, given people’s day-to-day struggle for survival.

Haiti’s government has put forward a preparation and response plan with an estimated $37.2 million budget, but it’s unclear how effective it can be. Local and international organizations have been meeting to coordinate a response.

One street vendor woman (known as a “Ti Marchan”) said in an interview with Haiti’s Island TV that the present confinement is intolerable. Needing to earn money to feed up to eight family members, she exclaimed that she would rather be infected with the virus than not work, since her sole daily livelihood was now being taken away.

Many are asking if Haiti’s government will be able to secure basic food staples to feed the majority of the population, as large parts of the population live on just a few dollars a day or less and are now being pressured to isolate themselves and not work.

The Haitian government has announced food distribution measures for some districts, and this comes as the prices of some basic food staples has increased in recent months and the currency has rapidly depreciated.

By comparison, in the nearby Dominican Republic, state officials have announced on national television that the nation’s poorest sectors will receive financial aid for food purchases through the government’s “solidarity debit cards.” They will start receiving an increase of 5,000 Pesos (about US$92) monthly, starting on April 1 and running through the end of May. The Dominican Republic has become one of the largest locations for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Caribbean and is among the region’s top tourist hotspots, so the government has many more resources to deal with such a crisis.

The first cases of Covid-19 in the Dominican Republic were officially acknowledged by its Health Ministry in late February. The Dominican government, meanwhile, has begun to take drastic measures such as a suspension of flights from Europe, a 5 PM to 6 AM curfew which may turn into a draconian 24-hour lockdown with exceptions for grocery shopping, buying prescriptions, and other necessary excursions.

Haiti is the Dominican Republic’s number two export market after the US, and is heavily dependent upon Dominican exports for basic food staples such as rice, as well as manufactured consumer items. Thus, anything that impacts the Dominican Republic eventually affects life in Haiti.

A number of Haitian migrant workers appear to have fled back to the country to be with family. Others, whose economic survival depends on daily migrant labor, have no choice but to find illicit ways to cross back and forth across the border.

A large part of the Haitian population is clearly aware of the real dangers posed by the coronavirus, but at the same time many confess they have no choice but to gain their daily livelihoods through the usual improvised and informal activities in the small scale economy. The overwhelming majority of these workers are forced to take very crowded public transportation to their workplaces.

As the virus hits countries worldwide, it is unlikely foreign governments will be able to marshal the Herculean support that Haiti needs. Haiti spends just $13 per capita on healthcare, compared to $180 by the Dominican Republic, and $781 in Cuba.

Confusion reigns. Some Haitians have criticized recent moves by the government to push thousands of people to line up for national IDs, after officials declared the cards will be required to receive aid during the pandemic.

Meanwhile a kidnapping wave has traumatized people in Haiti, even affecting the transportation sector bringing in goods from the Dominican Republic.

A protest movement pauses and hospital director is kidnapped

The situation is made more difficult by the ongoing political crisis. Moïse now governs without parliament after failing to hold elections, and had been facing a mass uprising threatening to chase him from office. Strong diplomatic support from the US has been the linchpin allowing his tenuous political survival.

The coronavirus though has put a pause on the giant anti-government protests that occurred throughout late 2019 and into early 2020. Yet these will undoubtedly return given how sharply the inhuman essence of neoliberal capitalism in Haiti and elsewhere has been exposed by the current crisis.

As massive protests against the US-backed Moïse rocked Haiti throughout 2019, and his government struck back by hiring violent paramilitaries to crack down, the Bernard Mevs Hospital went into debt treating hundreds of wounded demonstrators for free.

This March, while Covid-19 bore down on Haiti, the hospital’s director, Dr. Jerry Bitar, was kidnapped. Hospital staff refused to take in new patients until Bitar was freed, leading to his release on March 27.

In the 21st century, Haitians have experienced one ordeal after another. Estimates of deaths from the January 12, 2010 earthquake range from 46,000 to 160,000 people, while many more were wounded and up to a million were displaced. The country has yet to recover from these tragedies, with many survivors still trapped tent cities.

Haiti has also survived a cholera outbreak which killed close to 10,000 and sickened over 800,000. UN occupation troops were found to have caused the epidemic through their negligence, and a campaign demanding reparations from the UN continues.

The country has also suffered several devastating hurricanes, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which extensively ravaged Haiti’s southern peninsula, wiping out crops and coastal towns.

US-imposed right-wing governments set the stage for another disaster

Haiti’s population faces the coronavirus pandemic after a series of man-made crises that set the backdrop for the coming crisis.

First, there were the 1991 and 2004 coup d’états, both US-backed schemes that sought to roll-back popular gains made after historic turnouts at the polls by Jean Bertrand Aristide’s leftist Lavalas movement.

In the 2010-2011 elections, Washington intervened through the Organization of American States (OAS) to effectively change the electoral results and install the right-wing pop singer Michel “Sweet Micky” Martelly, ushering in a decade of US puppet regimes.

Martelly’s successor, Moïse, appears to have pocketed millions of dollars stolen from funds meant to help build up the country through Venezuela’s PetroCaribe program. Funds from PetroCaribe have been used by many Caribbean states to plug budget shortfalls and invest in important infrastructure.

Moïse is officially mentioned 69 times in the recent corruption report produced by the State Administrative Court and is considered one of the principal beneficiaries, both politically and financially, of the Petrocaribe funds corruption scheme.

In response to protests, the Haitian government and its allies have also turned to violent repression against popular neighborhoods where anti-government sentiments run high.

US-backed Haitian government agents accused of conducting massacre By @JebSpraguehttps://t.co/mCCl3jCvKA — The Canary US (@TheCanaryUS) December 20, 2018

Instead of investing in healthcare, the government has increasingly sought to strengthen its repressive capabilities.

With the support of planners at the Inter-American Defense Board, the Moïse government has begun rebuilding the military, which was disbanded in 1995. Historically, the Haitian military has symbolized repression of the popular will, presiding over numerous coups, massacres, and counter-insurgency campaigns to guarantee the Washington consensus.

As Jake Johnson of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) has written, “The Inter-American Defense Board, a body of the OAS, developed a ‘white paper’ in July [of 2015] focused on reinstating a Haitian defense force with the support of the UN.”

By 2018, Haiti’s new army had six personnel being trained at the US military’s School of the Americas (SOA), which was renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).

In March, the Haitian government disseminated a snappily produced public relations video on Whatsapp that portrayed soldiers distributing bags of rice to the doors of people’s ramshackle homes.

In February 2020, however, the newly reconstituted military engaged in a deadly clash with police officers in Port-au-Prince who had been locked in a labor dispute with the government. The conflict illustrated the fundamental purpose of the country’s military, which has always been loyal to the country’s political right-wing, and whose existence was sustained for the purpose of internal repression.

Battered by years of man-made and natural disasters, Haiti faces another historical ordeal with few resources to shoulder it. Sidelined and repressed by a US-imposed political apparatus, the poor majority will bear the brunt of the coronavirus.

Haiti,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article241797766.html,"With its first COVID-19 death, Haiti to get rapid testing","The sister organization of Boston-based Partners In Health in Haiti says it will begin using rapid tests to screen for the coronavirus in the Caribbean nation in hopes of being able to more quickly identify hotspots and determine who in the population may need to be isolated.

Zanmi Lasante says the group’s decision comes after “much consideration” and after weeks of waiting, to no avail, on the Ministry of Public Health and Population. It had asked health officials for authorization to use a 15-minute rapid test that can detect antibodies in the blood to confirm current or past exposure to COVID-19, the infection caused by the coronavirus.

“We have a moral obligation to battle this virus and do the best that we can for the people of Haiti,” said Elizabeth Campa, senior health and policy adviser for Zanmi Lasante. “As such, we will begin using the rapid test as a screening mechanism at our health facilities and at the border.”

On Monday, Haitian health officials reported that they now have 24 confirmed cases of the respiratory disease and said the country’s first death, a 55-year-old man with no travel history and underlying health issues was confirmation of community transmission. Globally the disease has infected nearly 1.3 million, killed 70,000 people and sent billions to shutter themselves at home.

Compared to the neighboring Dominican Republic, which has tested more than 4,000 people and registered 1,488 positive COVID-19 cases and 68 deaths, Haiti has only administered 257 tests. The issue of testing has led for calls for the ministry to much more quickly identify people who have the flu-like virus.

This is not the first time that Zanmi Lasante, which runs the 320-bed University Hospital in Mirebalais under the guidance of renowned medical anthropologist and infectious disease expert Dr. Paul Farmer, has been willing to go out on a limb in the name of the Haitian population during its 30-year-plus existence.

Similar decisions about screenings and treatment were made by the nonprofit healthcare provider in the ‘80s and ‘90s in regard to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, and in the past decade in response to the cholera epidemic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

The University Hospital in Mirebalais is one of the few health facilities in Haiti currently equipped to care for patients sickened by the coronavirus, and received Haiti’s first two positive COVID-19 patients, both of whom have since recovered. It also runs other healthcare facilities and works on the Haiti-Dominican border, where thousands of Haitians have crossed unchecked since both nations closed the border last month to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

Campa said Zanmi Lasante is aware that “the gold standard” remains the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR test, which is more accurate but much slower and can take days to get results. Any positive cases found through the 15-minute rapid test will then be transferred over for PCR testing, she said.

Doctors divided about benefits of rapid testing

The use of rapid testing in the battle to stop the spread of COVID-19 remains a divisive one among clinicians and public health specialists. During Monday’s coronavirus briefing in Port-au-Prince, Dr. Patrick Dely, who is responsible for the ministry’s epidemiology and laboratory section, addressed the rapid testing debate.

“Every country adopts measures that goes with their reality; their means and the resources they have, ” Dely said. “Your response cannot be based on what you see others are doing.”

Dely said there are three types of tests that can be done to detect the coronavirus. But given the studies on both the rapid antibody and antigen tests, the country runs the risk of missing 40 percent of positive cases with a false negative result. Haiti, he said, has chosen to go the more accurate route of the polymerase chain reaction, which only its National Laboratory is currently entrusted to do. The lab he said, has the capacity to run about 800 tests a day.

Not everyone agrees with this direction. Reginald Boulos, a Haitian businessman and physician with a master’s in public health, said given the reality of the country and the ministry’s own admission that Haiti now has community transmission, “it’s unrealistic to think that we can continue to do” the PCR tests

The country, he said, needs to employ the South Korea model, where face masks in public are mandatory and the crisis is being managed by “testing, testing testing” with a rapid antigen test. Unlike the antibody tests Zanmi Lasante plans to use to show the prevalence of the disease in communities, Boulos believes the antigen test provides more accuracy.

“We need to change approach; coronavirus cannot be a clinical approach and this is what we’re doing right now. We need a public health approach in Haiti; not just a clinician to have a nice laboratory being able to do 200 tests after three weeks. What does that say for a country with 10 million people?” Boulos said. “We are not testing the country. We aren’t really testing the people who we should be testing. People don’t even know where to go and get tested.”

More testing coming in Haiti

Boulos said the Association of Automotive Importers recently donated $80,000 to expand testing in Haiti and increase the number of beds for COVID-19 patients. The donation went to GHESKIO, a research, treatment and training facility in Port-au-Prince, which had been seeking $200,000 for its COVID-19 response.

“We made one condition: to increase the 1,000 tests to 2,500 and [Dr. William Pape] has agreed to that,” GHESKIO said.

Pape, the founder of GHESKIO, confirmed the donation, which he said will not go toward the purchase of rapid tests but the more accurate PCR tests.

The rapid test “is a catastrophe,” said Pape, who is a member of the scientific committee put in place by Haitian President Jovenel Moïse on the country’s COVID-19 response.

“If they were used we would hospitalize many patients who do not need to occupy unnecessary beds. At the same time, we would tell people who are infected that they are not and they would go around infecting others.” Pape said. “The PCR test we are using is very accurate.”

Pape said the ministry of health is right to follow the WHO/PAHO recommendations to only test people documented by a trained epidemiologist to have signs and symptoms of COVID-19.

“The nurse performing the test is highly exposed and must be properly protected, trained and certified. This is the best strategy when you have limited testing kits,” he said.

The Ministry of Health, Pape said, has ordered more test kits but they are not available for sale outside the U.S. Kits approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been ordered from South Korea, but the real issue is that test kits are sold separately from extraction agents, which are essential to conduct the test. There is a global shortage of extraction agents.

In addition to the donation by the Haitian private sector, Pape said the dean of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York “has graciously collected for us all extraction agents from their research labs” as well as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.

“This should all arrive early this week to increase tremendously our capacity to perform tests in Haiti,” he said. “Many more testing sites are being set up.”","['257 tests', '200 tests', '800 tests', '1,000 tests']",,,
Portugal,,https://www.themayor.eu/en/porto-opens-first-coronavirus-drive-thru-testing-centre-in-portugal,Porto opens first coronavirus drive-thru testing centre in Portugal,"On Monday the City Council of Porto revealed that through a partnership between the local government, ARS-Norte and Unilabs Portugal Laboratory, the city will open Portugal’s first COVID-19 drive-thru testing centre.

It is located at the Queimódromo do Porto, on the Circunvalação road and opened its doors on 18 March. Currently, the testing site is able to carry out a total of 400 tests per day – but eventually, it will be able to ramp it up all the way to 700. The facility, however, is reserved only for those who have already been referred by health officials for testing.

By using the drive-thru testing facility, potentially infected persons will avoid unnecessary contact with others – thus limiting the spread of the disease. After the results are in, those who have been discovered to actually be infected with the virus will immediately be sent into quarantine.

Porto at the front lines

The city of Porto and its local government have been doing everything in their power to aid the nationwide efforts in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus. On Monday, Rui Moreira, the mayor of the city, announced that every business and venue that could close has been shut down.

By combining the now traditional and accepted approach of mass quarantines with innovative ideas, the city is certainly at the forefront when it comes to combating the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. Authorities are more than happy for Porto to serve as a trial run for the drive-thru testing site in the country and believe that if it proves successful, it could be implemented on a national scale.

Drive-thru testing facilities have been operational for weeks in other parts of Europe and have proven to be more than effective and efficient. For example, in Helsinki, the drive-thru testing site has been of paramount importance for the city’s efforts in halting the spread of the virus.

These ICUs will be equipped with respirators, monitors, beds and all necessary devices to treat the most seriously ill with coronavirus. According to the Lisbon North University Hospital Center, two units with 10 ICU beds each will be installed in the capital, one in the Santa María Hospital and the other in the Pulido Valente Hospital. In this way, this hospital complex will have a total of 77 ICU places, which will be prepared for when the strongest peak of coronavirus infections in Portugal arrives.

The Porto University Hospital Center also announced that Mendes and Ronaldo will finance 15 ICU beds for the Santo António hospital. The heads of both centers expressed their appreciation for the agent and the footballer, after a detail that will save lives and help the toilets in Portugal. As a form of thanks, the UCI units will bear the names of Cristiano Ronaldo and Jorge Mendes.

Cristiano is at his residence in Funchal preparing individually as part of the quarantine of the Juventus players, forced by the positive for coronavirus from three members of the staff: Daniele Rugani, Blaise Matuidi and Paulo Dybala.

Trend:

All measures taken in Azerbaijan so far have produced the desired effect, said Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev in his appeal to the Azerbaijani people after attending the inauguration of medical masks manufacturing enterprise established by Baku Textile Factory LLC in Sumgayit Chemical Industry Park.

'As a result of the adoption of preventive measures, the spread of coronavirus in Azerbaijan has not gained large proportions now. Hundreds of people die in developed countries every day. The health system of no country can fully organize the treatment of an ever increasing number of patients. This should serve as a lesson for us. Therefore, the adoption of preventive measures in Azerbaijan and the implementation of these actions in accordance with the situation pursue one goal: to protect the life and health of our people and prevent the spread of the disease in Azerbaijan. All measures taken so far have produced the desired effect. Suffice it to say that 45,000 tests have been carried out in Azerbaijan to date. Currently, various Internet resources indicate the number of patients, the number of deaths, as well as the tests performed. Everyone can visit these sites and see,' said the head of state.

He noted that Azerbaijan is one of the leading countries in the world where so many tests have been performed.

'This has helped us to identify the disease, provide patients with prompt medical assistance and protect ourselves from even greater troubles. So far we have succeeded. At the same time, the adoption of operational measures and the implementation of actions in accordance with the situation have produced effect. The new quarantine rules which entered into force on 5 April pursue one goal: to prevent the spread of the disease in Azerbaijan. This goal was also pursued by the decisions that were made prior to 5 April and the new rules. I have repeatedly said that we have demonstrated national unity, national accord, and we must also demonstrate responsibility. But in the current conditions, taking into account the rules that entered into force on 5 April, people should demonstrate discipline, because strict measures are envisaged in relation to those violating these rules. And these measures are already in place. I am sure that our citizens will fully comply with these rules, the disease will not be widespread and we will be able to overcome this situation with minimum losses,' said the head of state.

President Ilham Aliyev noted that coronavirus patients undergo treatment in more than 20 hospitals today, including the most modern hospital, the 'Yeni klinika'.

'This clinic was opened relatively recently, at the end of March, and is designed for 575 patients. If we take into account that the clinic was commissioned ahead of schedule, its capacity to receive patients will gradually increase –100 patients at the initial stage, then 300 and then it will begin to operate at full capacity. Also, the hospitals I attended the opening of in the regions in early March of this year were also made available to the patients infected with coronavirus. The most modern hospitals located in the cities of Gazakh, Goranboy and Shamkir are treating patients with coronavirus. The number of beds in these three hospitals is around 500. So more than a thousand hospital beds meeting the most modern standards were put into operation in a matter of just one month, and patients infected with coronavirus are being treated there,' said the head of state.

As Europe becomes the epicenter of the outbreak, authorities are becoming increasingly concerned about a potential lack of ventilators, which are used to keep people alive if they are struggling to breathe.

Italy, which has been hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, has tendered for 5,000 ventilators and other desperately needed medical equipment.

“Our annual production last year was 10,000 so it’s an extremely big tender. We could only bid for 500 ventilators, and we have now received confirmation that we will deliver,” Getinge CEO Mattias Perjos said in an interview.

Getinge, whose rivals include Draegerwerk (DRWG.DE) and privately held Hamilton Medical, says it has an around 25% share of the global ventilator market and around 70% of the market for heart-lung machines.

Perjos said demand growth for both was accelerating.

SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS

Getinge’s ventilator plant in Sweden has raised output substantially from last year’s levels in response to the demand jump, going from one shift to nearly two, and would quickly ramp up further were it not for component shortages, Perjos said.

“The bottlenecks in ventilator production are currently in the component inflow,” he said, adding that while some suppliers struggle to access materials, others have reached maximum capacity already.

Getinge is trying to place large orders at its suppliers to support them, Perjos added.

It is also considering replacing components that are in short supply. During a meeting with Swedish government officials last week, Getinge had asked that authorities relax rules on the revalidation of medical equipment which is required after component changes, a process that can be lengthy, Perjos said.

Getinge sources from several countries in Asia and Europe.

Perjos said Getinge’s heart-lung machine factory in Germany was already operating in three shifts, so increasing capacity there was more of a stretch than at the ventilator plant.

Besides accelerating demand for ventilators and heart-lung machines in Europe and the United States, Getinge is also experiencing increasing interest in its sterilisation and disinfection gear, the company’s CEO said.",,"['5,000 ventilators', '500 ventilators']",,
