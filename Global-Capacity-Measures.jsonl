for good or bad remains to be seen.\"\n\n'We need to defend Europe against detractors'\n\nA number of high-profile figures have alleged China is not acting out of humanitarian spirit but to implement a geopolitical vision.\n\nSpain and the Czech Republic returned Chinese testing kits as EU Minister of Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell said China was aggressively pushing the idea that unlike the US, it was a \"responsible and reliable partner\".\n\n\"We must be aware there is a geopolitical component, including a struggle for influence through spinning and the 'politics of generosity',\" Borrell said. \"Armed with facts, we need to defend Europe against its detractors.\"\n\nAccording to Oertel, Borrell's view was a \"pragmatic assessment\".\n\n\"Europe needs to show a much greater degree of internal solidarity,\" she said, \"but it also needs to be much clearer about how much support it is actually already giving and coordinating.\"\n\nBut Hasaan Khawar, a public and economic policy analyst based in Islamabad, said China has established itself as an \"emerging world leader, and the West isn't entirely sure on how to respond to this new reality\".\n\n\"I do feel [Borrell's] comments on this issue are presumptuous and unfair,\" he told Al Jazeera. \"More importantly, these comments did not reflect the views of [all] member countries, as the countries that have been helped by China have been immensely appreciative.\"\n\nItaly, for example, has welcomed support from China and Cuba, unusual allies in a time of crisis, while EU members such as Germany refused to send equipment they may need for their own citizens.\n\nForeign Minister Luigi Di Maio praised China for sending medical equipment and doctors, while Italian politicians and diplomats expressed dismay at the lack of solidarity demonstrated by their closest neighbours.\n\nMaurizio Massari, Italy's EU ambassador, wrote on March 10 that while Italy had asked to activate the EU Mechanism of Civil Protection for the supply of medical equipment, \"not a single EU country responded to the Commission's call\".\n\n\"Only China responded bilaterally. Certainly, this is not a good sign of European solidarity,\" he added.\n\nAl Jazeera's Usaid Siddiqui contributed to this report from Doha.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['16,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

(Kyodo News via AP)\n\nLeaders like Cuomo have been forced to go outside normal channels and work with authoritarian governments and private companies, or create partnerships with other states, as the U.S. stockpile of medical supplies is being limited and the Trump administration has threatened to cut off exports, which could erode diplomatic relations.\n\nWhile the state of Massachusetts used the Patriots\u2019 team plane to pick up over a million masks from China, Russia has also sent medical equipment to the U.S. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said Friday he\u2019d prevent the export of N95 protective masks, prompting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to say that Canada won\u2019t bring retaliatory or punitive measures, while noting that Canada ships gloves and testing kits to the U.S.\n\n\u201cI think of the thousands of nurses who cross the bridge in Windsor to work in the Detroit medical system every day,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cThese are things Americans rely on.\u201d\n\nThe number of people infected in the U.S. has exceeded a quarter-million, with the death toll climbing past 7,000; more than 3,500 of those deaths are in New York state, including more than 1,900 in New York City alone. In addition to getting ventilators from China and Oregon, Cuomo has issued an order that forces even private hospitals in the state to redistribute ventilators to the hospitals most in need.\n\n\u201cI want this all to be over,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt\u2019s only gone on for 30 days since our first case. It feels like an entire lifetime.\u201d\n\nAs the number of people infected has grown to more than 1.1 million worldwide, health care systems are straining under the surge of patients. In China, air raid sirens sounded across the country Saturday and flags flew at half staff in tribute to victims of the coronavirus pandemic, including the health care \u201cmartyrs\u201d who have died fighting to save others.\n\nWith the highest number of infections in Europe and their hospitals overwhelmed, Spain and Italy struggled to protect medical staff on the front lines of the outbreak, while 17 medics in Egypt\u2019s main cancer hospital tested positive for the virus.\n\nItaly and Spain, with combined deaths of more than 25,000 and nearly a quarter-million infections, have reported a high percentage of infections among health care workers.\n\nCarlo Palermo, head of Italy\u2019s hospital doctors\u2019 union, fought tears as he told reporters in Rome of the physical risks and psychological trauma the outbreak is causing, noting reports that two nurses had committed suicide.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a indescribable condition of stress. Unbearable,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, new infections continued to slow their once-exponential pace in Italy, with 4,805 new cases registered Saturday that brought the country\u2019s official count to 124,632. The death toll continued to mount, with 681 new victims bringing the world\u2019s highest toll to 15,362.\n\nIn France, 7,560 people have died of coronavirus-related issues since the start of the outbreak in the country, including at least 2,028 in nursing homes, health director Jerome Salomon said. More than 440 of the overall deaths happened in the last 24 hours.\n\nWorld Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned African leaders of an \u201cimminent surge\u201d in coronavirus cases on the continent, urging them to open humanitarian corridors to allow the delivery of badly needed medical supplies.\n\nMore than half of Africa\u2019s 54 countries have closed air, land and sea borders to prevent the virus\u2019 spread but that has delayed aid shipments. Virus cases in Africa are now over 7,700, and the head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned some nations will have more than 10,000 cases by the end of April.\n\nEleven Russian military planes carrying disinfection experts landed in Serbia on Saturday, which Serbian Defense Minister Aleksandar Vulin said shows \u201cthat we are not alone.\u201d\n\nThe transport followed last month\u2019s deployment of a similar Russian coronavirus task force to Italy and the delivery of medical supplies to the United States. Russia has reported a relatively few 4,700 cases and 43 deaths.\n\nIn China, where the coronavirus was first detected in December, authorities have cautiously lifted restrictions amid dropping numbers of infections. On Saturday it reported just one new confirmed case in the epicenter of Wuhan and 18 others among people arriving from abroad. There were four new deaths for an official total of 3,326.\n\nSpain\u2019s Health Ministry reported 18,324 infected health workers as of Saturday, representing 15% of the total number of infections in the country.\n\nStill, as Spain completes its third week in a state of emergency, there were signs the number of new infections were slowing, but they were still high with 7,026 new cases reported overnight Saturday and 809 deaths.\n\nIn Italy, more than 11,000 medical personnel have been infected \u2014 just under 10% of the official total \u2014 and some 73 doctors have died, according to the National Institutes of Health and the association of doctors.\n\nSignificantly, many were general practitioners or dentists who were believed to have been exposed via respiratory droplets.\n\nA key reason for the high rate among general practitioners was that flu was raging at the same time in the early part of the year, \u201cwhich didn\u2019t allow us to discriminate between the two,\u201d said Palermo, the doctors\u2019 union head.\n\nWorldwide, confirmed infections rose past 1.1 million and deaths exceeded 60,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say both greatly under-count the true number of victims because of lack of testing, mild cases that were missed and governments that are underplaying the crisis.\n\nAt the same time, more than 233,000 people have recovered from the virus, which causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks.\n\nForliti reported from St. Paul, Minnesota.

The 56-year-old man was taken to Sion hospital and eight of his family members placed into quarantine.\n\nQuick guide What are coronavirus symptoms and should I go to a doctor? Show Hide What is Covid-19? It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic. What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes? According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and\/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment. About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19. In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either: a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back\n\na new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough? Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities. In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should stay at home for at least 7 days. If you live with other people, they should stay at home for at least 14 days, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home. How many people have been affected? China\u2019s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January. As of 6 April, more than 1.25m people have been infected in more than 180 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. There have been over 69,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,200 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. Italy has been worst affected, with over 15,800 fatalities, and there have been over 12,600 deaths in Spain. The US now has more confirmed cases than any other country - more than 335,000. Many of those who have died had underlying health conditions, which the coronavirus complicated. More than 264,000 people are recorded as having recovered from the coronavirus.\n\nYet for a densely populated country of 1.3 billion people, the number of cases is still relatively low compared with Europe and the US, and believed to be linked to both low levels of testing and poor access to an already overstretched healthcare system with people not reporting their symptoms.\n\nIndia spends only about 1.3% of its GDP on public health, among the lowest in the world. Only 47,951 tests have been done so far and there are just 51 government-approved testing centres across the country.\n\nThe jump in number of cases was linked to an annual two-day convention of the Muslim sect Tablighi Jamaat on 13 March, for which about 3,500 people gathered from all over the country and abroad in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Nizamuddin. Almost 2,000 stayed in the area for days afterwards, and the area has become the coronavirus hotspot of India.\n\nThe outbreak from the Nizamuddin mosque gathering also inflamed religious tensions in a city still reeling from communal riots last month that took 50 lives, with Hindu mobs rampaging through the streets attacking Muslims in their homes.\n\nAcross Indian media and social networks, Muslims were blamed for spreading the virus while \u201cCorona Jihad\u201d began to trend on Twitter.\n\nThe gathering also appeared to trigger a spread of the virus across numerous states from Kashmir to West Bengal by those who returned home afterwards. So far, 10 people who attended the event have died while 1,800 people have been sent to nine hospitals and quarantine centres across the country.\n\nHowever, despite the jump in number of cases this week, the Indian government insists there is still no community transmission and that cases have been either from those who travelled abroad or in localised incidents. Lav Agarwal, the joint secretary in the health ministry, told reporters: \u201cNowhere have we said that there is a community transmission. We are still in a local transmission in this country.\u201d\n\n\n\nRaman R Gangakhedkar, the head of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), also insisted there was \u201cno reason to panic at the moment\u201d. Nonetheless, the ICMR conceded last month that community transmission was \u201cinevitable\u201d in India.\n\n\u201cUntil we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission, let us not over interpret things,\u201d said Gangakhedkar.\n\nDoctors in hospitals across India said the lack of proper protective equipment available for medical staff, including basic masks, meant that patients presenting with coronavirus symptoms were being turned away. Doctors in Kolkata described how they were made to wear plastic raincoats to examine possible coronavirus patients, while a doctor in a Delhi hospital resorted to wearing a motorcycle helmet to cover his face.\n\nOne junior doctor working in a Kolkata hospital where coronavirus patients are being treated, described how \u201cfor over a week, we came in close contact with suspected corona patients without proper protective gear \u2026 We all are left at the mercy of God.\u201d\n\nThe doctor also cast aspersions on the claim that the disease was not already spreading within impoverished communities.\n\n\u201cEvery day thousands of people gather here, seeking treatment for many infectious diseases. Last week, I noticed, hundreds of people, with many coughing, having fever and breathing problems stood on queue waiting for their turn to be examined by us,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey stood in the queue for hours and many of them were coughing and sneezing. I have every reason to believe many were carriers of Covid-19 who spread the infection to people in that same line, who in turn are now spreading it in the community \u2026 hundred or thousand times more people should be tested for the infection. Otherwise, the coronavirus situation will turn unmanageable.\u201d\n\nA recent report, jointly published by three American universities and the Delhi School of Economics, claimed that India could have as many as 1.3 million coronavirus infections by mid-May.\n\nTesting capacity may about to increase. Last week, Mylab Discovery, a company based in the city of Pune, became the first Indian firm to get full approval to make and sell testing kits, which have already shipped to labs in Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, Goa and Bangalore. Each Mylab kit can test 100 samples and costs 1,200 rupees.\n\nPrivate company Practo also announced it has been authorised by the government to conduct private coronavirus tests, which can be booked directly. The facility is available only for Mumbai residents but they say it will soon be widened out to the whole country.","tests":"['47,951 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The average age of the mechanical, electronic and aerospace engineers who work for the firm is 26.\n\nIndia, by most estimates, only has 48,000 ventilators. Nobody quite knows how many of these breathing assistance machines are working. But it is a fair assumption that all those available are being used in intensive care units on existing patients with other diseases.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why some people in India with coronavirus symptoms are living in trees\n\nAbout one in six people with Covid-19 gets seriously ill, which can include breathing difficulties. The country faces seeing its hospitals hobbled as others around the world have been, with doctors forced to choose who they try to save.\n\nAt least two Indian companies make ventilators at present, mostly from imported components. They cost around 150,000 ($1,987; \u00a31,612) rupees each. One of them, AgVa Healthcare, plans to make 20,000 in a month's time. India has also ordered 10,000 from China, but that will meet just a fraction of the potential demand.\n\nThe invasive ventilator being developed by the engineers at Nocca Robotics will cost 50,000 rupees ($662). Within five days of beginning work, a group of seven engineers at the start-up have three prototypes of a portable machine ready.\n\nThey are being tested on artificial lungs, a prosthetic device that provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide from the blood. By 7 April, they plan to be ready with machines that can be tested on patients after approvals.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption India is beefing up isolation beds in hospitals\n\n\"It is most certainly doable,\" said Dr Deepak Padmanabhan, a cardiologist at Bangalore's Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, and a key advisor on this project. \"The simulations on artificial lungs have been done and seem to work well.\"\n\nInspiring story\n\nThe race to develop this inexpensive, home-grown invasive breathing machine is an inspiring story of swift coordination and speedy action involving public and private institutions, something not common in India.\n\n\"The pandemic has brought us all together in ways I could never imagine,\" says Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, a professor of biological sciences and bioengineering at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur, and a key mover of the project.\n\nThe young engineers mined open source medical supplies groups on the internet to find information on how to make the ventilators. After securing permissions, it took them exactly eight hours to produce the first prototype. Of particular use, say doctors, were some designs by engineers at MIT. With imports stalled, the engineers picked up pressure sensors - a key component of the machine that helps supply oxygen to lungs at a pressure that doesn't cause injury - from those used in drones and available in the market.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption India needs thousands of ventilators to cope with a possible rush of patients\n\nLocal authorities helped open firms that stock components - each machine needs 150 to 200 parts - and made sure that a bunch of engineers who had returned home to Nanded after the lockdown were still able to travel 400km (248 miles) back to Pune to work on the machine.\n\nSome leading Indian industrialists, including a major medical device-making company, have offered their factories to manufacture the machines. The plan is to make 30,000 ventilators, at around 150-200 a day, by the middle of May.\n\nSocial media influencers joined the effort. Rahul Raj, a lithium battery-maker and an IIT alumnus, crowd-sourced a group called Caring Indians to \"pool resources and experience\" to cope with the pandemic. Within 24 hours, 1,000 people had signed up. \"We tweeted to the local lawmaker and local police in Pune to help the developers, and made contacts with people who would be interested in the project,\" Mr Raj said.\n\n'No-frills machine'\n\nExpat Indian doctors and entrepreneurs who went to the same school - IIT is India's leading engineering school and alumni include Google chief Sundar Pichai - held Zoom meetings with the young developers, advising them and asking questions about the machine's development. The head of a US-based company gave them a 90-minute lecture on how to manage production. A former chief of an info-tech company told them how to source the components.\n\nLastly, a bunch of doctors vetted every development and asked hard questions. In the end, more than a dozen top professionals - pulmonologists, cardiologists, scientists, innovators, venture capitalists - have guided the young team.\n\nDoctors say the goal is to develop a \"no-frills\" breathing machine tailored to Indian conditions.\n\nVentilators depend on pressurised oxygen supply from hospital plants. But in a country where piped oxygen is not available in many small towns and villages, developers are seeing whether they can also make the machine run on oxygen cylinders. \"In a way we are trying to de-modernise the machine to what it was barely 20 years ago,\" says Dr Padmanabhan.\n\n\"We are not experienced. But we are very good at making products easily. The robots that we make are much more complex to make.

The hospital chain - without specifying the number - said it had dedicated a portion of those ventilators for treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nHospitals are now earmarking isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients so that other patients and staff are protected from the novel coronavirus infection.\n\nA ventilator is a mechanical breathing device that can blow air and oxygen into the lungs. Ventilators are critical for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe COVID-19.\n\nWhile on paper 1,000 ventilators sounds a big number, what will be available for COVID-19 patients in reality is much lower as hospitals have to reserve ventilators to treat non-COVID-19 cases such as heart attacks, strokes and other emergency cases.\n\nThere is a huge cost element, too, in using ventilators. A ventilator costs anywhere between Rs 5-15 lakh.\n\n\"Generally, we keep three ventilators for 10 beds ICU. These machines are expensive, so hospitals typically bill them as part of ICU charges, some bill them separately as well,\" said Dr. Rajendra Patankar, Chief Executive Officer of Pune-based Jupiter Hospital.\n\nThe average ICU charges per day in Mumbai is Rs 4,000. In some high-end tertiary hospitals, the charges will go upwards of Rs 20,000 per day. These are conservative estimates taken from publicly available information. More than two-thirds of the ICU billing constitutes ventilator charges.\n\nCatch COVID-19 outbreak LIVE updates here\n\nAs per a Brookings report, the country might need anywhere between 110,000 - 220,000 ventilators by May 15 in the worst-case scenario. The number of ventilators today available in the country is a maximum of 57,000. Most of those available ventilators cannot be put to use.\n\nBut, experts say we may struggle if COVID-19 cases surge in days ahead as nearly 3 percent of COVID-19 patients would require ventilators. Experts across the spectrum ranging from doctors to engineers and entrepreneurs are trying to solve the ventilator puzzle.\n\nIndia has reported a total of 1,251 positive coronavirus cases as of March 31 morning.\n\nAddressing ventilator shortage\n\nThe government has declared essential technical features for COVID-19 ventilators.\n\nAs per the government specification, a ventilator should be turbine, compressor based because the installation sites might not have central oxygen lines. Among other features, the machine should have invasive, non-invasive and CPAP features to make them versatile. They also need to have 200-600 ML tidal volume, Lung Mechanics Display and continuous working capability for 4-5 days.\n\nBut, to get ventilators of those specifications will take time. Moneycontrol earlier reported that companies were running low on inventories. Getting components from China has become difficult due to the disruption of the supply chain. Sources have told Moneycontrol that China, too, has started clamping down on exports of ventilators and related components to shore up its own requirement.\n\n\u201cTo tackle the shortage of ventilators India should go in for two-three models, one an low-cost respirator model for epidemic and a high-end technology ICU model,\" said Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator - Association of Indian Medical Device Industry (AiMed), the domestic medical devices trade lobby.\n\nAiMeD said it contacted seven of its ten major manufacturers, which had confirmed that the current production capacity of ventilators was 5,500-5,750 pieces per month. This is where defense labs, big automotive and capital goods companies are coming to rescue.\n\nMaruti Suzuki India, Mahindra & Mahindra, Bharat Forge, Tata Motors, Hyundai and public sector BHEL, BEL and DRDO are coming up offering their expertise to rapidly scale up production of ventilators.\n\nFor instance - SkanRay, Mysuru-based ventilator manufacturer has created a consortium with BEL, BHEL and Mahindra to ramp up production from standard 2,000 units per month to 30,000 units per month by May.\n\nSimilarly, Delhi-NCR-based Agva has tied up with Maruti to scale up production from 400 units per month to 10,000 pcs per month by May. Others are similarly gearing up to address the challenge.\n\n\"The aim is to produce 50,000 ventilators per month by May,\" Nath said.\n\nSkanRay, the leading ventilator manufacturer, has created a consortium with BEL, BHEL and Mahindra to ramp up production from standard 2,000 pieces per month to currently 5,000 pieces per month and 30,000 pieces per month by May. Similarly, Agva has tied up with Maruti to scale up production from 400 pieces per month to 4,000 pieces per month in April to 10,000 pieces per month by May. Others are similarly gearing up to address the challenge.\n\nNo frill 'Ambu Bag'\n\nWhile the conventional ventilators are expensive, hard to produce and not portable, experts say we may have to find other ways to tide over the ventilator shortage if we begin to see a surge of cases.\n\nOne of the solutions put forward was the bag-valve mask, often called by the proprietary name of \u2018Ambu Bag,\u2019 used for resuscitation in emergency situations.\n\n\"The \u2018bag valve mask\u2019 is currently hand-powered and, therefore, not suitable for continuous use as a ventilator. It would be easy to design a similar device powered by an electrical source, which could be a car battery, apart from the conventional power supply. It could be made portable, and therefore adopted in villages and other areas without a power supply and be inexpensive enough to manufacture in bulk,\" said Prof BS Murty, Director - IIT Hyderabad and Prof. V. Eswaran of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, IIT Hyderabad.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra is working on an automated version of the Bag Valve Mask ventilator (commonly known as Ambu bag). Once proven, Mahindra says this design will be made available to all for manufacturing. Bag Valve Mask can be used and thrown away, removing the possibility of cross-contamination.\n\nAnand Mahindra, Chairman of Mahindra Group announced it will cost below Rs 7,500.\n\nCPAP - an interim solution\n\nAnother interim solution that companies have started working on is converting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure or CPAP machines as breath support devices for COVID-19 patients.\n\nCPAP machines help people with sleep apnea breathe more easily. It is also widely used in premature babies whose lungs are not fully developed and require respiratory support. A CPAP machine increases the air pressure in a person's throat to prevent airway from collapsing when inhaled.\n\nBengaluru-based InnAccel is working to develop a CPAP that can be used for COVID-19 patients needing breathing support.\n\nInnAccel develops and markets a portable CPAP machine called 'Saans' \u2013 that runs on a battery where there is no power source. It can also be hand-pumped if the battery fails.\n\n\"A bag valve mask is the simplest level of ventilation. We should use it but I don't think that is anyway adequate for COVID-19 patients. But, there are intermediate modes between absolutely high-end ventilators and a rudimentary bag in mask. CPAP is one mode,\" said Siraj Dhanani, co-founder and CEO of InnAccel.\n\nDhanani said they were working on a prototype based on their CPAP platform to develop devices for COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe government specified ventilators should have basic modes such as pressure control, volume control and pressure support ventilation, along with CPAP.\n\nSplitting ventilators\n\nDoctors and engineers are also scrambling to figure out how to modify their ventilators to serve a large number of patients with limited resources.\n\nA team at Delhi-NCR based hospital chain Max Healthcare was able to split their ventilator, which can be used for upto four patients if necessary.\n\nThe critical care experts at Max Healthcare extensively tested the device and determined that it worked very well on all functional and patient safety parameters. The device is to be used only in case of dire shortage of ventilators and when we have a large number of patients needing ventilator support. It is not simple as it sounds though.\n\n\"My team and I then designed a simple but ingenious device, which can be safely attached to the ventilators, splitting the airflow into four distinct streams for 4 patients. We even produced this device in-house using the 3D printing facilities at Max Healthcare,\u201d said Yudhvir Singh, Head - BioMedical Engineering, Max Healthcare.\n\nCurrently, Max Healthcare has 254 adult ventilators across its network. It is not Max alone; other hospitals have also started work on splitting ventilators.\n\nFollow our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic here","tests":null,"ventilators":"['1,000 ventilators', '19 ventilators', '50,000 ventilators', '220,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Social distancing has been suggested as a tool to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d, or in other words, prevent the health system from being overburdened. Although the number of COVID-19 cases are still low in India, experts have warned against community spread of the disease which will lead to rapid and huge increase in demand for health facilities. Private healthcare is expensive and unavailable for many poor households in India which leaves public healthcare facilities as the only available option for them. For patients who are found to be COVID-19 positive, isolation wards are needed; additionally, for critical cases, intensive care is needed. Currently, almost all suspected cases of coronavirus are referred to government hospitals and it\u2019s important to assess where we stand in terms of medical capacity to provide necessary healthcare to the affected individuals.\n\nIn this piece we focus on availability of government hospital beds[1] for major states in India. Using data from National Health Profile\u20132019, we observed that there are 7,13,986 total government hospital beds available in India. This amounts to 0.55 beds per 1000 population[2,3]. The elderly population (aged 60 and above) is especially vulnerable, given more complications which are reported for patients in this age group. The availability of beds for elderly population in India is 5.18 beds per 1000 population. In the heatmaps below, we show the state-level variation in availability of government beds in India.\n\nWe observe that many states lie below the national level figure (0.55 beds per 1000 population)[4], these include Bihar, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Maharashtra, Odisha, Assam and Manipur. These 12 states together account for close to 70% of the total population in India. Bihar has an acute shortage of government hospital beds with just 0.11 beds available per 1000 population. Some states do better on this metric such as West Bengal (2.25 government beds per 1000) and Sikkim (2.34 government beds per 1000). The capital city of Delhi has 1.05 beds per 1000 population and the southern states of Kerala (1.05 beds per 1000) and Tamil Nadu (1.1 beds per 1000) also have better availability of beds. The scenario is pretty similar when the analysis is done for just the elderly population: Northeastern states do far better than others; southern states also have higher number of beds available for elderly population \u2014 for example, Kerala (7.4), Tamil Nadu (7.8), Karnataka (8.6) \u2014 while northern and central states have relatively low availability of government beds for elderly population.\n\nThe availability of government beds is abysmally low in India, and an epidemic like coronavirus can very quickly complicate the problem even further. An estimated 5-10% of total patients will require critical care in form of ventilator support. In a worst-case scenario, according to one estimate at least, we may end up with 2.2 million cases in India[5] by May 15, which implies that we will need 110,000 to 220,000 ventilators. We have no official figures on the number of ventilators available in the public sector, however ,we arrive at an estimated figure using the number of hospital beds available \u2014 7,13,986 total government beds, out of which 5-8% are ICU beds (35,699 to 57,119 ICU beds)[6]. Assuming that 50% of these ICU beds have ventilators, we arrive at an estimate of 17,850 to 25,556 ventilators in the country. Even in the best-case scenario where all ICU beds are equipped with ventilators, we have a maximum of ~57k ventilators to cater to a growing number of COVID-19 patients. Clearly, the growing demand for ventilators is going to outstrip the limited supply really soon.\n\nWhile demand is being kept down by behavioural interventions such as social distancing etc, supply of beds and critical care equipment like ventilators needs to be quickly ramped up. In this regard, the government has already banned the export of critical care medical equipment. Additionally, excess capacity in private healthcare can be strategically used by the government and emergency plans of setting up hospital beds in army camps should be executed as soon as possible.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] Total number of government hospital beds include Central Government, State Government and Local Government bodies (PHCs are also included in the number of hospitals).\n\n[2] Population figures have been used as of year 2019.

India's borders will Myanmar will also remain closed.\n\nWhat has helped India so far is the slow pace of the progress of the infection, as compared to several Asian and European countries and America. While the outbreak has attained pandemic proportions in most of these countries, it is still limited to people with a travel history and their local contacts in India. Widespread of infection at the community level is yet to be seen, allowing the government - Centre and States - to develop strategies to contain the spread of infection rather than large scale mitigation, which could be an extremely tough challenge.\n\nAccording to the health authorities, India is still in the first and early second stage of the outbreak. This means that the outbreak has been only travel-related, with some signs of the start of local transmission. The containment strategies hence have been points of entry surveillance, the listing of contacts (made by the infected ones with travel history), adoption of quarantine measures - both home quarantine as well as the government's isolation centres - and social distancing measures like the closure of schools, ban on gatherings, to limit the spread of disease at a large community level.\n\nThe next stage, which requires a much bigger preparation, is to be ready with mass mitigation strategies meant to minimise mortality and morbidity while ensuring essential services and continuity of operations with minimal impact on health and non-health sectors.\n\nManoj Joshi, a distinguished fellow of Delhi based think tank Observer Research Foundation (ORF) points out in an article that India's 1.2 million government hospital beds are heavily skewed towards urban areas with hugely disparate distribution across states.\n\n\"An intensified spread of Covid-19 could put up a demand for millions of more beds. According to a WHO-China joint mission report, 5% of people diagnosed with Covid-19 require artificial respiration, another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen and not just for a few days since the duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). So, high-quality care is needed by the 20 per cent or so who are infected, which really means ICU-level care\", Joshi notes.\n\nHere lies the real test, as Joshi says India's 70,000 ICU beds available, in big and small hospitals and nursing homes, cater to some 5 million patients requiring ICU admissions every year and is already stressed.\n\nGross inadequacy in terms of ventilators in hospitals, levels of hygiene can only make the situation worse.\n\nIn a presentation before the Prime Minister's Office, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has already flagged the enormity of the task ahead. In the case of a large outbreak, the MoHFW talks about the triage of patients through screening clinics and surge capacity of hospitals for isolation and ventilator management.\n\nThe government has also initiated steps to check shortages and black-marketing of protection gears, especially masks and sanitizer and asked manufacturers to enhance their production capacity of these items, to make the supply chain smooth.\n\nThe coming days will be crucial, and India needs, along with all that is being planned and done, more luck on its side to handle any outbreak of larger proportion.\n\nAlso Read: FPIs withdraw Rs 37,976 cr from Indian markets in March amid coronavirus fears\n\nAlso Read: YES Bank was on the verge of going belly up; here's what Q3 results reveal\n\nAlso Read: YES Bank Q3 net loss spikes to Rs 18,564 cr, its worst ever","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['70,000 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

And trying to bridge this gap are the country\u2019s top technology institutes.\n\nStudents and faculty at the many Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) have joined the fight against coronavirus as the number of positive cases in the country surpassed 1,900 and the death toll, 50.\n\nSome are producing personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers who have been forced to the frontlines with raincoats and helmets in the absence of proper protective gear. Up to 90 tonnes of PPE have been shipped to Serbia from India.\n\nMeanwhile, others are developing low-cost ventilators, which is in short supply. The nation has only 30,000-50,000 ventilators which are \u201cwholly inadequate,\u201d according to the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy (CDDEP). Buying 10,000 units from China is not nearly enough. \u201cWe will need upwards of 700,000 and up to a million ventilators to address the peak (demand),\u201d the health research organisation said.\n\nCheaper Covid-19 testing kits, alcohol-based sanitisers, and other solutions, small and big, are also in the works.\n\nWith a bunch of prototypes ready, these institutes are seeking the government\u2019s help to tie up with public sector undertakings for large-scale manufacturing.\n\nSeeking protection on auto mode\n\nThe safety of health professionals is on top of most researchers\u2019 mind.\n\nIIT-Guwahati\u2019s chemistry and bioscience & bioengineering departments are together developing prototypes of waterproof protective gear that come with an antiviral coating. Additionally, design experts at the institute have created a 3D-printed prototype of a full-face shield, including headgear, whose manufacturing, they say, can be scaled up immediately.\n\n\u201cOur idea is to make this a state-of-the-art facility for the entire northeast region,\u201d IIT-Guwahati director, TG Sitharam, told The Economic Times newspaper. \u201cThis centre, in future, would help develop highly competent manpower for diagnosis of different infectious diseases in the early stage of infection and thus their prevention too.\u201d\n\nA startup incubated at IIT-Delhi has, in the meantime, developed the capacity to produce 100,000 N95 masks a day, but it needs permission to keep production running during the lockdown.\n\nOne solution to lighten the load on the overburdened medical system is to curb health workers\u2019 exposure to patients altogether. IIT-Guwahati, for instance, is making robotic units that can screen potential patients and deliver medicines and food in isolation wards.\n\nStudents at the institute have also created drones that can be used to spray disinfectants and undertake surveillance without involving humans. They already have seven models of the drone with capacities between 10 litres and 25 litres, and they could make 50 by April-end, one of the student innovators told ThePrint.\n\nBesides medical professionals, patients, too, are in need of some rapid innovations.\n\nBringing order to patient chaos\n\nWith merely 6.8 tests done per million population, which is among the world\u2019s lowest, the Narendra Modi government has come under fire for gross under-testing.\n\nA shortage of kits is a big concern. Researchers at IIT-Delhi have now developed a testing kit which they claim is cheaper and is currently undergoing clinical trials at the Pune-based National Institute of Virology. Although its price isn\u2019t public yet, the government has capped prices at Rs4,500 ($59) for now.\n\nMeanwhile, IIT-Guwahati has provided life-saving equipment to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital in Assam, including two real-time polymerase chain reaction machines used to analyse DNA samples for Covid-19 diagnosis. The machines can analyse up to 2,000 samples in 24 hours. The institute is also working on making handheld temperature measuring units, ICU beds, ventilators, medical waste disposal for isolation wards, disinfection showers, hand sanitisers, and preventive masks.\n\nSevere cases of Covid-19 infection cause or exacerbate respiratory problems.\n\nWith few ventilators\u2014most of them already being used for critical care patients\u2014the situation can quickly take an alarming turn. That\u2019s why IIT-Hyderabad director BS Murty proposed that the government consider the existing \u201cbag valve masks\u201d as an inexpensive, easier-to-make option. These are self-inflatable devices used to deliver breathing support in emergency situations. These cost a mere Rs5,000 compared to the Rs40 lakh for each conventional ventilator.\n\nSince the devices are handheld, they cannot be a permanent replacement for ventilators. However, \u201cit would be easy to design a similar device powered by an electrical source, which could be a car battery, apart from the conventional power supply,\u201d professors at the university told Mumbai Mirror. \u201cIt could be made portable, and, therefore, adopted in villages and other areas without a power supply and be inexpensive enough to manufacture in bulk.\u201d\n\nStopping the spread\n\nAt the Guwahati and Kanpur IIT campuses, researchers are working on vaccines as well.\n\nThree faculty members of IIT-Kanpur\u2019s biosciences department have already \u201cmanaged to isolate the RNA extract of the virus,\u201d deputy director Manindra Agrawal told The Indian Express on April 1. \u201cThey are in the process of sourcing a similar extract from IIT-Indore. We are hopeful of developing a possible vaccine in the next couple of months, which can then be tested in a clinical trial.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, basic hygiene is in focus. As sanitiser supplies run out, these institutions are making their own.\n\nIIT-Roorkee manufactured over 150 litres of a herbal hand sanitiser that is now being distributed free on the campus. \u201cIt is imperative to maintain basic hygiene practices since there is no specific treatment or vaccine for the disease,\u201d said Siddharth Sharma, a research scholar at IIT Roorkee\u2019s centre of nanotechnology, who helped prepare the product.\n\nResearchers at the IIT Kharagpur campus have also come up with two different alcohol-based hand sanitisers. The Ropar, Hyderabad, and Madras campuses, too, have begun producing their own.\n\nMoreover, as India buckles up for stage 3, the community transmission period, of the pandemic, monitoring suspected cases and curtailing the spread is going to get trickier.\n\nAt IIT-Bombay, students and alumni have developed a mobile app called Corontine. It is based on geo-fencing, alerting the authorities if a carrier moves out of a quarantine zone. The app can generate alerts such as text messages and emails if the user moves out of the designated area. It also notifies authorities if a device is transmitting the same coordinates for too long so a call can be made to check the whereabouts of the person.\n\nIn Punjab, students at the IIT-Ropar campus, together with other engineers, came up with an app to warn users about suspected or confirmed Covid-19 carriers within two or three feet of them, as long as the other person has registered on the app, too. Ideally, it would also make it easier to trace who is coming in contact with whom.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['50,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":"['100,000 N95 masks']"}

In comparison, South Korea tests 8,996 for every million people, Singapore 6,666, and Malaysia 1,605.\n\nAsked by The Straits Times on Monday (April 6) about Indonesia's very low rate, Mr Achmad Yurianto, a government spokesman for Covid-19 management, said: \"We don't test based on the size of population, but based on contact tracing of positive cases as well as based on the visits to health facilities by people with Covid-19 symptoms.\"\n\nHe added that Indonesia is also doing rapid tests, but the number of such tests - and the number of any confirmation tests after this procedure - do not add to the Covid-19 national tallies.\n\nHe stressed that such rapid tests, which are not as reliable as the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, are used only to help with early \"screening\" of people who may have contracted the virus.\n\nAny close contact who is tested negative using a rapid test kit must redo the procedure after a period of time, while anyone testing positive would have to be confirmed by a PCR test.\n\nRapid tests are antibody tests, which determines whether a person has developed immunity to the coronavirus. These tests, however, have a limited role in diagnosis, according to experts, as it takes the body four days or longer after infection to produce antibodies, which would be too late for the purpose of quick detection and contact tracing.\n\nIndonesia's ranking among the likes of Ethiopia comes as a surprise as the South-east Asia's largest economy has a GDP that is at least three times larger than any of the three bottom-ranked countries. Indonesia\u2019s GDP per capita, often used as an indicator of a country\u2019s standard of living, is at least double.\n\nIndonesia has a GDP of USD$1.1 trillion (S$ 1.58 trillion), while Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nigeria has a GDP of US$81 billion, US$250 billion, and US$375 billion, respectively.\n\nIndonesia's health ministry has been widely criticised for red tape in bringing in test kits, as well as equipment to read the PCR test samples.\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus: West Java governor calls on Jakarta residents to stay home during Ramadan\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic\n\nRecent media reports have also pointed out that the ministry's official Covid-19 death toll nationwide, currently at 209, is an understated figure contradicted by separate announcements by local governments in West Java and the Jakarta municipal government, which indicate a higher toll. This has raised questions about the health ministry's transparency and credibility in disclosing data, the local media has reported.\n\nJakarta, where about half of the national confirmed cases are from, issued a monthly figure on burials in the capital for March at 4,377, well above the monthly average of 2,745 burials last year and 2,774 burials the year before.\n\nOn April 2, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said 401 burials were conducted following the Covid-19 protocol. The national tally shows the fatality in Jakarta as only 99.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah is among currencies that have weakened sharply against the US dollar as the coronavirus crisis deepened. The rupiah fell 15 per cent year on year on April 6, while other currencies that have seen sharp falls in the same period include the Mexican peso, which dropped 26 per cent, and the Russian rouble, 19 per cent.\n\nSome of these countries have spent a lot of their foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the currency markets. Experts, however, have argued that uncertainty and a lack of credibility pose the greatest threat to these countries' currency values, and improving transparency in their Covid-19 data and boosting testing rates would be the most effective measures to address their currency depreciation woes.","tests":"['16 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

I think we are in the range of that\u201d.\n\nThe government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be like that,\u201d said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.\u201d\n\nDoctors dying\n\nIndonesia\u2019s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.\n\nThe country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\n\nYurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.\n\nHowever, Budi Waryanto, an epidemiologist from the University of Indonesia, told Reuters, \u201cThe hospitals are not ready to support the potential cases. Treatment will be limited.\u201d\n\nAlthough only hundreds of people have been hospitalized for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.\n\nIn a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.\n\nIn Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.\n\n\u2018We bring our own masks'\n\nStaff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,\u201d the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\n\u201cMy friends, one by one, catch the virus,\u201d he said, holding back tears.\n\nThe government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.\n\nA new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.\n\nClick here to follow LIVE updates on coronavirus outbreak\n\nIndonesia\u2019s health system is highly decentralized, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.\n\nA lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.\n\n\u201cIf you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,\u201d said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth\u2019s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.\u201d\n\nA study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data, found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.\n\nUpdated Date: Mar 25, 2020 17:01:27 IST\n\nTags : Corona, Corona In India, Corona Virus, Corona Virus Bangalore, Corona Virus Delhi, Corona Virus Hyderabad, Corona Virus In India, Corona Virus India, Corona Virus Symptoms, Corona Virus Update, Coronavirus, Coronavirus Bangalore, Coronavirus Cure, Coronavirus Delhi, Coronavirus Disease, Coronavirus In Bangalore, Coronavirus In Delhi, Coronavirus In Hyderabad, Coronavirus In India, Coronavirus India, Coronavirus Indonesia, Coronavirus Symptoms, Coronavirus Update, Coronavirus Update In India, Coronavirus Vaccine, Covid 19 India, Delhi Coronavirus, Holi 2020, India Coronavirus, Indonesia, Italy, n95 Mask, NewsTracker, Seattle, South Korea, Symptoms Of Coronavirus, US","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['321,544 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

Seven health workers are among those who have died.\n\nWhile confirmed case have risen to almost 900, researchers have estimated that there could be tens of thousands of hidden infections across the country, and there is growing concern that medical facilities will be unable to cope in the event of a major outbreak.\n\n'Confusion reigns': life inside Hong Kong's coronavirus quarantine centres Read more\n\nOver the past week, two major hospitals have appealed for supplies, while some healthworkers threatened to go on strike after they were forced to wear raincoats for protection. As of Monday, as many as 42 medical staff were infected with coronavirus in Jakarta.\n\n\u201cI just pray and have faith so that I can stop worrying, even though sometimes that feeling (of worry) appears again,\u201d Agnes Tri Harjaningrum, a paediatrician who works in state and private hospitals in the capital, told the Guardian. She fears the country could face a crisis similar to that experienced in Italy.\n\nDonations of protective equipment and testing kits arrived from China on Monday morning, but by Tuesday night shortages remained in some of Jakarta\u2019s hospital wards. Equipment is being prioritised for doctors who are directly handling patients, she said.\n\nIndonesia, the world\u2019s fourth most populous country, was slow to carry out tests, having reportedly performed only a few hundred earlier this month. While cases were detected throughout February in most countries across south-east Asia, it was not until 2 March that the country of 264 million people confirmed its first infections. A study by Harvard University, which analysed air traffic from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, had raised questions over the country\u2019s previous lack of cases. The health minister responded at the time by describing the analysis as \u201cinsulting\u201d and stating the country was on high alert.\n\nThe president has since acknowleged the need for mass testing, which is being ramped up in priority areas. So far 2,863 have been tested.\n\nOn Monday, it was estimated by academics at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine that as few as 2% of Indonesia\u2019s coronavirus infections have been reported. That could mean there are more than 34,000 cases. This is higher than the roughly 27,000 recorded in Iran \u2013 though the researchers also estimate that Iran may be identifying as little as 7.2% of its patients.\n\nThe researchers emphasise that these are rough estimates based on preliminary analysis and it is not yet peer reviewed.\n\n'Sensitise to sanitise': Bobi Wine uses song to fight coronavirus across Africa Read more\n\nThere are some limitiations to the estimates. How a country\u2019s demographics might affect the death toll from Covid-19, for example, has not yet been factored into the study. \u201cSeverity [of covid] is highly correlated with age, which means we need to account for it for it to be more accurate,\u201d said Dr Timothy Russell, the lead author. With a median age of 28, Indonesia\u2019s population is younger than many other affected countries.\n\nAccording to official figures, the capital Jakarta, home to 9.6 million people, is among the worst hit, with hundreds of cases, while dozens of infections have also appeared in Banten and West Java.\n\nCases appear to be scattering. In West Papua, the easternmost province of Indonesia, three cases have been confirmed while 35 people have been put under surveillance because they have symptoms including pneumonia and have had contact with a confirmed patient.\n\nAccess to quality health care is limited in the province, especially in highland areas, and health workers are currently assessing patients online because of equipment shortages.\n\nAnalysis by Reuters suggests that the country\u2019s health system is significantly less well resourced than that of Italy or South Korea, which have both faced major outbreaks.\n\nIndonesia has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data, which is equal to about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\n\nIndonesia is converting the athlete\u2019s village built for the 2018 Asian Games into an emergency hospital, which it is hoped will be able to treat 24,000 patients.\n\nModelling by the Eijkman-Oxford Clinical Research Unit (EOCRU), reported by the Jakarta Post, has suggested that, without tough steps to contain the virus, there could be up to 71,000 infections by the end of April.\n\nJakarta\u2019s governor has declared a state of emergency, and told businesses and religious groups to take measures to stop the spread of the virus. All tourism and entertainment venues have been closed, and public transport limited.\n\nBut while various lockdowns have been imposed in Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, Indonesian president Joko Widodo has rejected calls for such measures. He has instead urged the public to stay at home and promised rapid testing. This is now being rolled out in three provinces, while 100,000 protective gears are also being distributed.\n\nZubairi Djoerban, head of the Indonesian Doctors Association coronavirus task force told the Guardian earlier this week that supplies will be distributed soon. \u201cPrivate sector will help, businessmen will help.\n\n\u201cBut in the field, please ... the management must [match the] pandemic, meaning that it must be quickly-quickly-quickly-quickly.\u201d","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['321,544 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

Meanwhile, another order of 100,000 PPE sets is expected to arrive by mid April. Pakistan has also procured nearly 100 walk-through thermal gates to be placed at airport gates. Pakistan would have enough medical equipment, including personal protection kits, by April 5 to improve the safety of the health workers, officials say.\n\nTesting labs to be increased to 50\n\nTo improve the testing capacity, NDMA is working in close collaboration with NIH to increase the existing number of coronavirus testing labs from 14 to 50 in next 20 days, according to the NDMA chief. The new testing labs would be set up in Islamabad, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, Rawalakot, Abbotabad, Sargodha, D I Khan, Gujrat and Bahawalpur in Punjab, two more in Sindh and Balochistan each, to cover a wider population.\n\nTraining programme for laboratory specialists\n\nPakistan is also beginning a training program for the paramedics and laboratory staff to overcome the shortcomings. Initially, NDMA would recruit 100 lab technicians with expertise in molecular biology. \u201cWe will offer 6-month contract to these lab technicians and if the program is successful then it will help overcome laboratories gaps for testing patients,\u201d NDMA chief added.\n\nAll health workers in ICU to be immediately equipped\n\nAt least 16,700 PPE suits are being delivered to hospitals across the country. The government officials have assured that all of the 30,000 medical health practitioners working in intensive care unit (ICUs) would be equipped with a complete medical kit by early April. They would each be provided a set of face-shields, goggles, two N95 and 30 surgical masks, hand wash kit. Meanwhile, the number of beds in the intensive care unit (ICUs) has been increased to 19,670.

authorities.\n\nAs of March 31, according to official data, Punjab and Sindh had tested respectively 15,000 and 7,000 people for the coronavirus infection.\n\nThe corresponding figures for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces was 1,711 and 2,113.\n\nLiaquat Shahwani, a Balochistan government spokesperson, said more tests will be conducted once the province receives 1,000 test kits from the federal government.\n\nHe said the official request was for 50,000 kits due to the large number of people affected by the outbreak in Balochistan.\n\nDr Zafar Mirza, the prime minister\u2019s assistant on health issues, has said more than 15,000 people have been tested across the country.\n\n\u201cThe country is rapidly increasing its capacity of testing and treatment to cope with the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he said.\n\nFor his part, Asad Umar, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, said \u201cour testing capacity\u201d has been increased from 30,000 to 280,000, and will be raised to 900,000 by mid-April.\u201c\n\nSaqib Mumtaz, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), said Pakistan has got ventilators and protective gears from China, adding that orders had been placed for another 3,000 ventilator units.\n\nThe UAE announced through its embassy in Islamabad that it had sent its first batch of medical supplies.\n\nEven as foreign medical assistance begins to arrive, reports of new coronavirus cases are pouring in from across the country.\n\nEach province is now enforcing its own partial or full lockdown in an effort to slow the spread of the deadly virus.\n\nThe Sindh government has established isolation centers in 12 different hospitals, having won praise for being the first to announce a lockdown with effect from March 23.\n\nAt the same time, it has placed a ban on Friday prayer gatherings for fear of local transmission, which accounts for most of the province\u2019s 830 cases.\n\nA number of quarantine and isolation facilities are also up and running across the country.\n\nPunjab says that in addition to its quarantine capacity for 27,000 people, up to 100,000 patients can be treated in hospitals if the situation deteriorates further.\n\nWith \u201cflattening the curve\u201d of infections beyond the realm of imagination, Pakistan\u2019s provincial governments and the national government have their work cut out for them.\n\nIn his address in Lahore, Khan said there is no denying that these are difficult times.\n\n\"It is difficult because no one has the experience to deal with such a

As part of this a project, spanning on three years, was launched, costing about 1.1 billion rupees. Under the shadow of Higher Education commission (HEC) nine labs are to be established throughout the country. In view of this, two labs are developed at NUST for Intelligent Robotics and Deep Learning, two at NED UET Karachi on Smart City and Neuro-computation, one at the CIIT to work on medical Imaging and diagnostics, one at UET Lahore on Intelligent Criminology and one at Punjab University of computational modeling. National Centre of Artificial Intelligence was launched back in March 2018.\n\nCurrently, the president of Pakistan, launched an initiative to educate the upcoming generation through the President\u2019s initiative on Artificial intelligence (AI) and Computing (PIAIC), started in November 2018, offering opportunity to learning and developing business, in Blockchain, Cloud native and Artificial intelligence. The brainchild behind this vision was expressed in his Op-Ed in January 2019 published in The News, where he reemphasized the need for Pakistan to become a key player in \u201cfourth\u201d industrial revolution and the requirement to up its pace and efforts, in view of the current slow progress.\n\nWith the growing need of technology in our healthcare system, in most government run hospitals, this can be an opportunity to use artificial intelligence to cover and replace the shortage and gap of providing quality healthcare, through the use of artificial intelligence in the hour of need with the grave need due to corona virus disease (COVID 19) outbreak. Where many government and private organizations are offering grants from breakthrough discoveries that can help to fight the COVID 19 pandemic.\n\nCOVID 19 is a viral disease which at its severe form can lead into acute respiratory depression syndrome(ARDS). In such scenario, the patient requires invasive respiratory support such as mechanical ventilation. In studies from last flu pandemic extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) had a mortality benefit, in managing severe cases, compared to mechanical ventilation. This means that a patient with severe disease, supported on ECMO has a better chance of surviving.\n\nCurrently, according to recent media survey, Pakistan has about 2000 ventilators, with around 1300 ventilators in Punjab, 50 working ventilators in Balochistan, more than 500 in Sindh and 150 ventilators in Khyber Pakthunkhuwa, in a country of 210 million people, belonging from an under developed country. Whereas, there is no survey done about ECMOs, though, according to research citing, the use of ECMO is reported at, Aga Khan Hospital Karachi, Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology Rawalpindi and Institute of Cardiology Faisalabad, in Pakistan. Considering the fact that at the moment with 1975 patients diagnosed with COVID 19, till end of March, this resource is likely going to fall short by miles. Hence, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has announced that they are doing to procure 10,000 ventilators, though, no acquisition of ECMOs is announced.\n\nWhile, we need these resources, we also need these experts. A ventilator and ECMO, in short, advance medical equipment which requires trained medical personnel, from consultants, nurses, pharmacists and respiratory therapists, with expertise in emergency and critical care. This short fall, can be managed with the use of AI, with collaboration with medical experts. Government of Pakistan in view of President\u2019s initiative should mobilise its resources to generate AI that can help in successfully running these advance equipment and help bare the intensive care surge in hospitals with COVID 19 outbreak.\n\nThere could be an AI software that assists doctor to comprehend respiratory mechanics of a patient going towards ARDS, and when taken on mechanical ventilator, recommends settings according to the needs of the patient. There are examples of AI technology used in similar contexts such as CLiO2\u2122 which is an automatic oxygen controller that keeps the oxygen level in the blood within a safe range for newborns needing mechanical ventilation. Many researches in west, of date, are trying to develop AI for predicting tools for severity score and mortality prediction, prediction of sepsis, and decisions to support mechanical ventilations, as to when to place a person or support and when to withdraw it in view of its need and likewise predict duration of ventilation, which is essential in management patients and resources in intensive care.\n\nThis is actually the time for Pakistan to take its efforts to the next level and utilise its limited resources, in best possible way, to save lives. Hence, with the use of AI, Pakistan can win in defeating the COVID at its front-line, the hospitals. The use of AI in management of severe cases is one side of it, there is always room to go beyond. In the recent interview, Prime Minister Imran Khan has mentioned using AI in surveillance of COVID 19 to predict its spread and outbreak in localities. Let us hope, they make more use of AI technology, within the present circumstances.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['1300 ventilators', '10,000 ventilators', '2000 ventilators', '150 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

The government has announced the new initiatives to contain the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 1,800 people in Pakistan so far.\n\nThe country has received 10 ventilators from China last week along with thousands of masks and testing kits. \u201cChina is sending another shipment which includes 16 ventilators and 5000 protection equipment set that will be delivered to doctors, nurses and paramedics fighting in the front line against the pandemic\u201d Chairman of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Lt. Gen. Mohammed Afzal announced.\n\nPakistan to receive 1,000 ventilators in coming weeks\n\nPakistan has ordered nearly around 3000 ventilators from around the world and expects to receive at least 1200 within the next 10 days, NDMA chief informed during the March 30 press briefing. Furthermore, Pakistan would receive around 150 more ventilators next week, which have been donated by different countries. There are currently 2200 ventilators available in public hospitals for the critically ill patients.\n\nTesting kits capacity enhanced\n\nPakistan\u2019s testing capacity has been enhanced from 30,000 to 280,000 and would be further enhanced to 900,000 by mid April, the officials said on Tuesday. A day earlier, nearly 20,000 testing kits were dispatched to Sindh province, 5000 to Punjab, 4800 to Balochistan while there are 37,000 kits available to be provided as required and necessary. The country has performed nearly 15,000 coronavirus tests since the outbreak, according to Health Minister Dr Zafar Mirza.\n\nProtective gears and thermal gates\n\nPakistani officials are hopeful that nearly 100,000 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) \u2014 the key medical gear \u2014 would arrive by April 6. Meanwhile, another order of 100,000 PPE sets is expected to arrive by mid April. Pakistan has also procured nearly 100 walk-through thermal gates to be placed at airport gates. Pakistan would have enough medical equipment, including personal protection kits, by April 5 to improve the safety of the health workers, officials say.\n\nTesting labs to be increased to 50\n\nTo improve the testing capacity, NDMA is working in close collaboration with NIH to increase the existing number of coronavirus testing labs from 14 to 50 in next 20 days, according to the NDMA chief. The new testing labs would be set up in Islamabad, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Muzaffarabad, Mirpur, Rawalakot, Abbotabad, Sargodha, D I Khan, Gujrat and Bahawalpur in Punjab, two more in Sindh and Balochistan each, to cover a wider population.\n\nTraining programme for laboratory specialists\n\nPakistan is also beginning a training program for the paramedics and laboratory staff to overcome the shortcomings. Initially, NDMA would recruit 100 lab technicians with expertise in molecular biology. \u201cWe will offer 6-month contract to these lab technicians and if the program is successful then it will help overcome laboratories gaps for testing patients,\u201d NDMA chief added.\n\nAll health workers in ICU to be immediately equipped\n\nAt least 16,700 PPE suits are being delivered to hospitals across the country. The government officials have assured that all of the 30,000 medical health practitioners working in intensive care unit (ICUs) would be equipped with a complete medical kit by early April. They would each be provided a set of face-shields, goggles, two N95 and 30 surgical masks, hand wash kit. Meanwhile, the number of beds in the intensive care unit (ICUs) has been increased to 19,670.

In Balochistan, all government hospitals put together have only 49 working ventilators.\n\nAccording to the official record, Punjab\u2019s public sector hospitals have nearly 1,300 ventilators, most of which were procured by the Shahbaz Sharif government in 2016-2018 when it had launched a project for revamping of tehsil and district hospitals.\n\nIn Lahore, the government hospitals have around 250 ventilators. However, the Punjab Kidney and Liver Institute (PKLI), which is a state-of-the-art facility and the brainchild of Shahbaz Sharif, alone has 100 brand new ventilators.\n\nAn official said the Punjab health department had done a stocktaking of ventilators in the private sector in Lahore and came to know that it has approximately 475 ventilators. However, the private hospitals of Lahore have 51 such machines. The previous government had provided 130 brand new ventilators to 25 district headquarter hospitals in 2017. It had planned to make available 140 ventilators to all tehsil level hospitals but the initiative was discontinued after 2018 by the new dispensation. The official said that private hospitals outside Lahore in large cities like Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Multan, Rawalpindi and Sialkot have some 150 ventilators in approximately 30 hospitals.\n\nThe health sector expert said in the light of these facts, one urgent step the government has to take is to purchase as many ventilators as possible in order to prepare for emergency situation. Both federal and provincial governments will have to allocate additional resources, he said.\n\nHowever, another senior official, well conversant with development sector allocations, said that it was not only the issue of earmarking of resources but the capacity of health departments to procure ventilators and other much-needed equipment at top priority and expeditiously.\n\nReinforcing his claim with facts, the official said that the track record of the health ministry during the last two years is not very encouraging. The federal government for the second consecutive year is allocating hundreds of millions of rupees of funds to provide for every conceivable machine and equipment like MRI, ENT equipment, ophthalmology and nephrology and cardiology for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Islamabad but not a penny has been utilised.\n\nPlanning Minister Asad Umar, who was elected to the National Assembly from Islamabad and has keen interest in improvement of facilities at the PIMs, has expressed his displeasure over the state of affairs in the Health Ministry where concerned officers are again prepared to surrender the earmarked funds, unutilized, rather than purchasing the direly required medical equipment.\n\nWhen this state of affairs was put to a senior bureaucrat, he recommended to get hold of young civil servants, who did emergency procurement in Punjab as the present health ministry and PIMs bureaucracy may not measure up to the challenge.\n\nIn 2016-2018, the Punjab government had procured ventilators at around $13,000 per instrument with built-in compressor. Price may be higher now with huge global demand in view of the spread of coronavirus. The United States, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland and Japan are major manufacturers of ventilators. A doctor explained that a ventilator is a machine designed to provide mechanical ventilation by moving breathable air into and out of the lungs, to deliver breaths to a patient who is physically unable to breathe, or breathing insufficiently. It is critical and essential equipment for any ICU. Major complication of coronavirus affected patient is breathing difficulty especially in old and infirm and people already suffering for underlying ailments, the doctor said.\n\nAll countries affected by coronavirus are doing an urgent stocktaking of ventilators that their health systems have. Even the well-resourced system like Italy is finding it challenging to provide ventilators in large numbers, which should be commensurate with the number of serious patients. It is stated that even the United States does not have enough ventilators and ICU beds if there\u2019s a noteworthy surge of new cases. As with Italy, the health system could become overwhelmed.\n\nMany experts are doubting the ability of existing health systems to absorb the shock, what is called the surge capacity, meaning ability to handle serious patients, who need intensive care especially through ventilators.\n\nSo, the million dollar question is: will there be enough ventilators as the pandemic spreads? As the coronavirus spreads, there are continuing concerns among hospitals, public health experts and government leaders that ICUs would be hard-pressed to handle a surge in seriously ill patients.\n\nA key limiting factor to provide good care, experts say, is the number of ventilation machines, a hospital has on hand to help the most seriously ill patients breathe.\n\nA pulmonary disease expert explains the coronavirus like many respiratory viruses can cause inflammation in the lungs. When the lungs become inflamed, the membranes that transfer oxygen from the air into the blood become blocked.\n\nWhen patients develop this type of viral pneumonia, they often require bedside ventilators, which can supply higher levels of oxygen, help push air into the lungs to open them up, and afford more opportunity to get oxygen into the patient, he said.\n\nVentilators are generally a temporary bridge to recovery of patients in critical care, who need them to get better. These machines can be crucial to sustaining life in certain emergency situations. If there is a surge in seriously ill patients as COVID-19 spreads, ventilators could be in short supply from hospital to hospital or nationally.\n\nThe public health expert said if hospitals continue to be overwhelmed, at that point tough decisions would have to be made about who gets access to a ventilator and who does not. This could be left to the health professionals to choose who has chances to live and who is to be left. Experts say this scary scenario can only be avoided if prevention and containment protocols are immaculately followed.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['250 ventilators', '1,300 ventilators', '140 ventilators', '475 ventilators', '150 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

This shows how insignificant geographical boundaries have become and how the consequences of human actions are not limited to national borders. Any country that does not take the necessary precautions advised by health experts will soon be walloped by the disease. As Ph.D. students at George Mason University in the United States who are witnessing the flippant manner in which Pakistanis are reacting to the pandemic, the observation raises red flags and serious concerns for Pakistanis.\n\nLeading global experts agree on the necessity of good hygiene and social distancing to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSocial distancing, which is basically physical distancing, is the practice of reducing physical contact with anyone outside of close family and avoiding large social gatherings. In Pakistan, social distancing has been a significant challenge. Pakistan recently recorded 1,022 confirmed coronavirus cases and eight deaths and that number is increasing.\n\nPakistan has all of the conditions that would allow the coronavirus pandemic to run rampant.\n\nFirst, the geostrategic location of Pakistan as a gateway to Central Asia and the Middle East makes it vulnerable to transmission of the disease.\n\nSecond, Pakistan borders the two most affected countries\u2014China and Iran, both with frequent social, religious, and economic tourism with Pakistan. Moreover, there is a strong Chinese presence in Pakistan due to China\u2019s Built Road Investment (BRI) in the country.\n\nThird, the official response toward the pandemic has been insufficient at best. The prime minister of Pakistan, who has responded to the pandemic poorly, stated in a televised address to the nation that the country could not afford to take an economic break by enforcing social distancing. Furthermore, officials mishandled the infected pilgrims returning from Iran. Consequently, in the absence of a bona fide crisis response, the public is churning out myths and conspiracy theories and turning to totkay (sorcery and unscientific treatments) for coronavirus.\n\nFourth, communal gatherings and social settings are a lifeline for Pakistanis, thus offering the pandemic more infesting grounds if these are not restricted.\n\nLastly, Pakistan is a densely-populated country. For comparison, Pakistan is geographically close to fourteen times smaller than the United States, but it has a population of about 220 million compared to the United States\u2019 population of 330 million. This considerable population and crowded spaces are what coronavirus requires for its transmission.\n\nAnalyses predict that physical distancing would flatten the curve, which projects its future transmission, thus reducing the health-care burden. What this means in practice is that health providers will not become overwhelmed. Comparing numbers from cities enforcing distancing with those from cities not applying or delaying distancing substantiate the recommendations. For instance, research on the Italy outbreak shows the effectiveness of early action. The coronavirus disease was first detected in Italy, in the Lodi province, which imposed restrictions starting February 22. Whereas, Bergamo province, which started with fewer cases but did not enact restrictions until March 7, far surpassed the number of cases in Lodi.\n\nBeyond the confirmed 1,022 cases, the number of undiagnosed cases is likely to be much higher because of people\u2019s reluctance to get diagnosed, stigmatization, and the scarcity of resources. With a high transmission factor, researchers predict that the actual number of infected people in the United States would be ten times to hundred times the confirmed number. Considering undiagnosed cases existing in Pakistan to be ten times the official number, there may be as many as forty-five hundred active cases today. A compelling prediction suggests that community spread could increase the active cases to eighty thousand in a month.\n\nIs the health-care system in Pakistan equipped to deal with the coronavirus outbreak? The numbers suggest that it is not.\n\nAccording to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the country has close to 1.5 million beds available. Not only is this number inadequate, but the ratio of general to intensive care unit (ICU) beds is also concerning. The WHO recommends a 50:1 ratio of general wards to ICU beds, and there must be a trained nurse for each bed in the ICU. A leading news agency of Pakistan reports that the number of ICU beds in twelve major tertiary care hospitals in the largest province Punjab adds up to only 250. One of the largest hospitals of Punjab, Jinnah Hospital, has thirty-four ICU beds out of a capacity of 1250 beds. In addition, there is only one nurse available to serve two thousand people in Pakistan. According to the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority Pakistan (NDMA), the country has a total of 1,700 ventilators available to fight the coronavirus. Several reports highlight the current poor state of medical equipment in the country, which is more dire in rural areas.\n\nIn the face of an exponential rise in the number of coronavirus cases, the country will witness an acute shortage of beds, health personnel, and medical equipment.\n\nGiven the premise, Pakistan still does not realize the severity of the situation. Markets are bustling. People are partying. Greetings rituals do not suffice with a handshake, people also hug at every encounter.\n\nEven though Muslim countries across the world and the Middle East have closed mosques for daily and Friday prayers, many of Pakistan\u2019s hardliners are still debating whether or not shutting down congregational activities in the mosques is illicit.\n\nThe fact is that the pandemic will not disappear any time soon. We are all likely to be targets or carriers of the disease at some point. Thus, we must reorient our behavior in favor of collective interest. While researchers try to investigate this virus, one effective strategy, as learned from Italy and other countries, is to observe a lockdown and to quarantine (or practice distancing from others).\n\nA lockdown can only be fruitful if people are willing to accept it. The sooner Pakistan implements a lockdown and enforces quarantine, the sooner it can contain a community spread. In this regard, public gatherings of all sorts should be banned. Offices should give employees the facility to work from home. Ensuring social safeguards such as the provision of food to daily wage earners should be a central part of the lockdown strategy. In addition to observing quarantine and lockdown procedures, proper hygiene must be practiced to prevent the spread of the pandemic.\n\nImportantly, in a country where ulemas (religious scholars) are revered and looked up to for guidance, they should play a decisive role in educating the public while drawing from authenticated guidance. In particular, they should remind the people that Prophet Muhammad advised that people from communities with an epidemic disease may not leave and those from healthy communities should not enter the inflicted communities. Similarly, they should remind people of the Hadith (the Holy Prophet\u2019s saying) about proper hygiene practices, for example, the Holy Prophet said that the blessings of food lie in washing hands before and after eating. For those who overemphasize the congregational prayers while undermining the necessary precautions (social distancing for instance) either by mocking or stigmatizing others, ulema should narrate the following story, conveyed by ninth-century scholar Im\u0101m Al-Tirmidhi:\n\nOne day, Prophet Muhammad saw a Bedouin man leaving his camel without tying it. He asked the Bedouin, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tie down your camel?\u201d The Bedouin responded, \u201cI put my trust in God.\u201d The Prophet then said, \u201cTie your camel first, then put your trust in God.\u201d This story indicates the significance religion attaches to the adoption of precautionary measures.\n\nThe precautionary measures are for the safety and well-being of not only our families and communities but are also consequential to those separated by human-made borders. While the researchers are working hard to come up with a cure to combat the pandemic, a piece of simple yet potent and universal age-old advice is to focus on prevention.\n\nSince anyone exposed to the coronavirus can be a silent carrier, physical or social distancing seems a reasonable strategy for the greater good. Research suggests that young and healthy individuals can develop immunity to the disease yet they can unknowingly transmit it to others, including the elderly and those with a vulnerable immune system. Therefore, the higher and longer prevalence of the virus could strain the already burdened healthcare system in the United States and Pakistan as it has already significantly harmed many social capacities. We all must act quickly to combat the coronavirus pandemic effectively.\n\nTo avoid transmitting the disease, people in Pakistan, the United States, and other countries must assume that they are carriers of the disease and change their behavior as such\u2014at least until the global community can figure out other ways to cope with the virus. This attitude should shape our narratives and collective action. It should lead to limiting physical meetups and interactions, among other things.\n\nMuhammad Salar Khan is a Ph.D. Public Policy candidate and graduate research assistant at Schar School of Policy & Government, George Mason University.

At least 51 percent of all cases in Pakistan can be traced back to the Taftan quarantine camp, where thousands of Pakistanis returning from Iran - one of the countries worst-hit by the virus - were pooled together in a single space, without adequate screening.\n\n\"They put all those people together into a herd, and that resulted in cross infections,\" says Dr Daud. \"Then eventually, without testing [all of them], they released them after the 14th day.\"\n\nThose released from Taftan were transferred to separate provincial quarantine camps, where they have now been tested and are being screened before release.

So why has the United States been so slow in its attempt to develop reliable diagnostic tests and use them widely?\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent. Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases\u2014and test them faster\u2014have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.\n\nIn what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID19 case without known links to an infected person.\n\nThe problems have led many to doubt that the official tally of 60 confirmed cases in the United States is accurate. \u201cThere have been blunders, and there could be an underlying catastrophe that we don\u2019t know about,\u201d says epidemiologist Michael Mina, who helps run a microbiology testing lab at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s been very complicated and confusing for everyone with almost no clarity being provided by the CDC.\u201d\n\nThe situation may soon improve. State labs and commercial diagnostic developers hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their own tests, and FDA and CDC on Wednesday agreed on a workaround for the faulty CDC kit\u2014which has a problem that is not essential to its proper functioning\u2014so that it can now be used by at least some of the state labs that have it. But there\u2019s widespread discontent with the way the system has worked. \u201cThe U.S. government has not appropriately prioritized diagnostic tests and supported the laboratory response network to the degree they should have been supported over the years,\u201d says Luciana Borio, who in previous jobs had lead roles in responding to emerging threats at the National Security Council and FDA. If a new disease emerges, CDC normally \u201cgets the ball rolling\u201d with diagnostics because it has the expertise and the biosafety laboratories to handle dangerous novel pathogens, says Borio, who now works for In-Q-Tel, a not-for-profit venture capital firm. Typically, there are few confirmed viral samples from patients at the outset, which researchers need to validate their tests, and CDC has the capability to grow the virus for this critical quality assurance step. Once the agency has a working test, that goes out to state labs. Then, in a third phase, commercial labs take over and either produce their own tests or scale-up the CDC one. \u201cI would have hoped to see that third phase by now,\u201d Borio says. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, as the virus causing COVID-19 is officially known, CDC\u2019s sluggishness was apparent 1 month ago. On 26 January, the agency held an unusual Sunday teleconference for the media to provide an update about the rapidly growing outbreak. There were then five cases in the United States, but the CDC lab in Atlanta was still the only one in the country able to test for the virus, and it repeatedly had backlogs. Asked why more labs weren\u2019t able to do the tests, Nancy Messonnier, who then was leading CDC\u2019s response, said it was a quality issue. \u201cWe hold ourselves to an incredibly high standard of precision in terms of laboratory testing,\u201d Messonnier said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to inadvertently make a mistake in patient care.\u201d CDC finally started to send kits to state and local health labs on 5 February. But on 12 February, it revealed that several labs had difficulty validating the test because of a problem with one of the reagents. The key problem with the kits is what\u2019s known as a negative control, says Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL). CDC\u2019s test uses the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to find tiny amounts of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in, say, a nose swab. To make sure a test is working properly, kits also include DNA unrelated to SARS-CoV-2. The assay should not react to this negative control, but the CDC reagents did at many, but not all, state labs. The labs where the negative control failed were not allowed to use the test; they have to continue to send their samples to Atlanta.\n\nThe declaration of a public health emergency \u2026 limited the diagnostic capacity of this country. It\u2019s insane. Michael Mina, Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital\n\nIn principle, many hospital and academic labs around the country have the capability to carry out tests themselves. The PCR reaction uses so-called primers, short stretches of DNA, to find viral sequences. The CDC website posts the primers used in its test, and WHO publicly catalogs other primers and protocols, too. Well-equipped state or local labs can use these\u2014or come up with their own\u2014to produce what are known as a \u201claboratory-developed tests\u201d for in-house use.","tests":"['459 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Indonesia has reported 55 deaths, the highest in Southeast Asia.\n\nA study by the London-based Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases released on Monday estimates that as few as 2% of Indonesia\u2019s coronavirus infections have been reported. That would bring the true number to as many as 34,300, which is more than Iran.\n\nOther modellers are projecting that cases could rise to as many as 5 million in the capital, Jakarta, by the end of April under a worst-case scenario.\n\n\u201cWe have lost control, it has already spread everywhere,\u201d Ascobat Gani, a public health economist told Reuters. \u201cMaybe we will follow Wuhan or Italy. I think we are in the range of that\u201d.\n\nThe government says the impact of the virus will not be that severe.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t be like that,\u201d said Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, referring to comparisons with outbreaks in Italy and China.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is that we rally the people ... they have to keep their distance.\u201d\n\nDOCTORS DYING\n\nIndonesia\u2019s health system compares poorly with those in other countries hit hard by the virus.\n\nThe country of more than 260 million people has 321,544 hospital beds, according to health ministry data. That is about 12 beds per 10,000 people. South Korea has 115 per 10,000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIn 2017, the WHO found Indonesia had four doctors per 10,000 people. Italy had 10 times more, on a per capita basis. South Korea has six times more doctors.\n\nYurianto said with proper social distancing measures there should not be a need for a large number of additional beds and that medical staffing was sufficient to tackle the virus.\n\nA worker spray disinfectant in a residential area, to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Makassar, South Sulawesi, Indonesia March 26, 2020 in this photo taken by Antara Foto.

Treatment will be limited.\u201d\n\nAlthough only hundreds of people have been hospitalised for coronavirus, doctors told Reuters the health system was already under strain. Many health staff lack protective equipment, with one doctor telling Reuters how she had to wear a raincoat because there were no coveralls available.\n\nIn a sign of poor infection controls in hospitals and clinics, eight doctors and one nurse have died from the coronavirus, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association.\n\nIn Italy, where there have been 6,077 coronavirus deaths, 23 doctors have died.\n\n\u2018WE BRING OUR OWN MASKS\u2019\n\nStaff at one hospital on the outskirts of Jakarta had threatened not to come to work on Tuesday because of a lack of protective equipment, another doctor told Reuters.\n\n\u201cWe bring our own masks, our own suits that may not be of standard quality,\u201d the doctor told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.\n\n\u201cMy friends, one by one, catch the virus,\u201d he said, holding back tears.\n\nThe government said this week it had sourced 175,000 new sets of protective equipment for medical staff that would be distributed across the country.\n\nA new emergency hospital has been opened in Jakarta with an eventual capacity to treat up to 24,000 patients. Doctors and medical staff have been promised bonuses and 500,000 rapid testing kits have arrived from China.\n\nIndonesia\u2019s health system is highly decentralised, making it hard for the central government to coordinate its response across a sprawling archipelago of some 19,000 islands spanning 5,100 km.\n\nA lack of intensive care unit (ICU) beds also worries experts, especially as the country enters peak dengue fever season, which adds to demand for the facilities.\n\n\u201cIf you are critically ill and you can get into ICU and get put on a ventilator, most people should survive,\u201d said Archie Clements, a public health specialist from Perth\u2019s Curtin University, referring to people infected with the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t get them into ICU and get them on a ventilator, then they will die.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nA study in the Critical Care Medicine journal in January, which compared intensive care beds for adults in Asian countries using 2017 data, found Indonesia had 2.7 critical care beds per 100,000 people, among the lowest in the region.\n\n(This story corrects name of Budi Haryanto in paragraph 14)","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['321,544 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

(AP Photo\/Andre Penner) The Associated Press\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian health officials grappling with the new coronavirus outbreak have issued a stark warning about a lack of hospital beds, masks, testing devices and trained staff across Latin America's largest nation.\n\nA Health Ministry report issued on Friday said Brazil can currently carry out 6,700 COVID-19 tests a day, but that it will need to process as many as 30,000\u201350,000 tests daily during the peak of the outbreak, expected in June.\n\nThis latest assessment of the public healthcare system raises serious questions about its capacity to face the outbreak in a country of nearly 210 million. It also calls for the maintenance of quarantine measures in states that are most badly hit, challenging President Jair Bolsonaro's more laid-back approach to the virus.\n\nBolsonaro has compared the new coronavirus to a \u201clittle flu\u201d and publicly attacked governors that introduced quarantine measures, such as in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, two of the country\u2019s biggest clusters.\n\nAs of Saturday afternoon, the health ministry had reported 10,278 confirmed cases and 431 deaths. But the outbreak is still in its early phase, the report said, and the country's hospitals are not ready to handle a peak.\n\nOfficials pointed to a shortage in trained health professionals \u201cto handle mechanical ventilation equipment, respiratory physiotherapy and advanced nursing care\u201d for critically ill patients, while intensive care units and general hospitalization beds are \u201cnot properly structured or in sufficient numbers.\u201d\n\nThe assessment, done in compliance with World Health Organization directives, said logistical issues had prevented hospitals from acquiring sufficient personal protective equipment, \"placing workers in an important risk group\u201d.\n\nAuthorities are seeking partnerships between the public and private sectors to address shortages in testing capacities, but such agreements would not bear fruit for at lest another two weeks they said.\n\nOfficials say past studies of influenza, another respiratory disease caused by viral infection, show that Brazil's continental size and varied climates \u2013 temperate, subtropical and equatorial \u2013 mean the COVID-19 disease will likely spread and peak at different times of the year, in different regions, making it more challenging for authorities to prepare a national plan.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nBolsonaro has increasingly isolated himself politically by maintaining that jobs and the economy must prevail and that Brazil \u201dcannot stop.\u201d\n\nHis message and public appearances showing him with supporters are at odds with recommendations from Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta. Tensions between the two men have risen as Mandetta, until recently a largely unknown technocrat, emerged as a reassuring figure in the midst of a public health crisis.\n\nThe minister has garnered support among Brazilians with daily updates on the coronavirus, filled with technical details, best practices and recommendations from authorities such as the World Health Organization.\n\nIn a radio interview, Bolsonaro said his health minister lacked \u201chumility\". Mandetta, asked about the president's declaration, said he would not quit: \u201cA doctor does not abandon his patient.\"\n\nIn Friday's report, the health ministry urged all states to maintain self-isolation measures. \u201cSocial distancing strategies adopted by states and municipalities contribute to avoiding the collapse of local health systems,\u201d the report said, citing efforts to fight the virus in Italy, Spain, China and New York City.","tests":"['50,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

These Governors Are Fighting Back","text":"Brazil\u2019s President Jair Bolsonaro is in a class of his own. He is the only leader left in the world to reject the consensus of scientists and statisticians on the gravity of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe far-right firebrand, who was elected in 2018 trading on conspiracy theories and half truths, has dismissed COVID-19 as a \u201clittle flu\u201d and remarked that \u201cwe all die someday.\u201d He has flouted his own health ministry\u2019s guidance by going on walkabouts to greet supporters and has urged Brazilians to leave isolation and return to work, defying the advice of the World Health Organization.\n\nNow, Brazil\u2019s leader has himself been isolated by an unprecedented alliance of key ministers in his federal government, congressional leaders, and 24 of the country\u2019s 27 governors, who have substantial power in a decentralized structure similar to the U.S. \u201cI can say the governors across Brazil have never been as united as we are now,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Doria, the center-right governor of S\u00e3o Paulo, who has emerged as a key opposition figure, tells TIME. His southeastern state, which has 46 million residents and a third of Brazil\u2019s GDP, has suffered more than 80 percent of the country\u2019s hospitalizations for Covid-19 and is racing to ameliorate the crisis.\n\n\u201cThe president despises us and attacks us. He has put us in an impossible position by creating a narrative that impedes the protection of people and life,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe governors \u2013 from the left, center and right \u2013 have decided to follow the correct path and maintain the WHO protocols.\u201d\n\nSao Paulo state Governor Joao Doria (L) and Sao Paulo city Mayor Bruno Covas (R) visit a field hospital set up for coronavirus patients at Pacaembu stadium, in Sao Paulo, Brazil on March 27, 2020 Nelson Almeida\u2014AFP via Getty Images\n\nAs of April 6, Brazil had reported 11,490 cases of the virus and 492 deaths. To try to slow that rate Doria and Wilson Witzel, his counterpart in the neighboring state of Rio de Janeiro, are among the majority of governors who have imposed strict isolation rules in their states, including suspending schools, prohibiting intercity buses, shutting down shops, bars and beaches and canceling concerts. All but three of Brazil\u2019s 27 states have brought in similar measures. Vice President Hamilton Mour\u00e3o and Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta have also continued to urge caution at least until the pandemic reaches its likely peak here in late April.\n\nIn response Bolsonaro, who says isolation will cost jobs, shared a video calling the governors \u201ca bunch of scoundrels,\u201d threatened to fire Mandetta and revealed he had already prepared a draft decree to order the country back to work. \u201cNobody should forget I am the president,\u201d he said. The far right leader, who made his career glorifying Brazil\u2019s 1964-1985 dictatorship, was also asked if he might use the ensuing crisis to mount a coup. He replied: \u201cIf I was I wouldn\u2019t say so.\u201d\n\nBrazil recorded its first case of COVID-19 in late January, but the numbers did not begin to grow until late February. On March 7, Bolsonaro dined with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Upon returning to Brazil, 25 of his entourage tested positive for the virus. Bolsonaro\u2019s son Eduardo told Fox News his father had also contracted the virus, then later denied that was the case.\n\nDoria, who says he has tested negative for the virus three times while working 16-hour days, spoke to TIME on the phone from S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cIt\u2019s a dramatic situation and happening at tremendous speed. We are running out of time to isolate, guide and treat people,\u201d he says. The country\u2019s 27 governors have held video conferences to make plans, excluding the president.\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo has opened an emergency hospital with 200 beds in a sports stadium and another with 1,800 beds is planned. \u201cHe is putting people\u2019s lives at risk,\u201d Doria says of Bolsonaro\u2019s walkabouts in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cThe president is doing nothing to combat the crisis and preserve lives.\u201d\n\nBrazil is ostensibly well equipped to manage a major national outbreak. It has 21 ICU beds for every 100,000 people, about double the proportion of such beds in Italy, France and Spain. But only half are in the public hospitals which 76% of Brazilians use and in some states the public system has less than a tenth of the capacity of private hospitals. The resources are also poorly distributed, with less than a quarter of Brazilian municipalities having public ICU beds. There are also fears for the spread of the virus in tightly-packed favelas and indigenous communities.\n\n\u201cRio de Janeiro has communities with a high population density and many vulnerable people,\u201d says Witzel, the governor of that state. \u201cThese are densely occupied areas, and our concern is a very fast contagion. By controlling the curve we will give these people conditions to survive. The human tragedy in Ecuador, with bodies on the streets, can happen if measures are not taken.\u201d Guayaquil, Ecuador\u2019s largest city, has emerged as a regional hotspot for the coronavirus, overwhelming local authorities, funeral homes, and hospitals.\n\nPopular frustration at Bolsonaro has grown. The clang of Brazilians banging pots and pans in anger from their windows in big cities became a nightly ritual. A recent poll shows 76% of Bolsonaro\u2019s voters support isolation measures even at the expense of the economy, though a majority of Bolsonaro voters continue to support the president. Multiple impeachment requests have been submitted to congress and a manifesto calling for his resignation has accused Bolsonaro of being the \u201cbiggest obstacle to making urgent decisions to reduce the spread of contagion, save lives and guarantee the income of families, jobs and companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe country needs to find a path that guarantees democracy and avoids social chaos that may result from Bolsonaro\u2019s attitude,\u201d says Fl\u00e1vio Dino, the leftwing governor of the northeastern state of Maranh\u00e3o and the only governor so far to sign the manifesto. \u201cThe president\u2019s popularity is declining fast, not because of the opposition, but because of his own mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very difficult to believe in his sincerity, seriousness and loyalty. It is already really difficult under normal conditions to govern like this [without dialogue with the federal government]. Imagine it in the exceptional and serious conditions we are experiencing now.\u201d\n\nWitzel, who rode from obscurity to his election in 2018 as part of Bolsonaro\u2019s then party but has threatened anyone in Rio breaking isolation rules with arrest, says the same fate should await the president. \u201cEveryone here whose disobedience puts people\u2019s health at risk is being charged with a crime,\u201d he says. \u201cThe President must also answer to that, to the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nDoria, a millionaire former presenter of the Brazilian version of The Apprentice who has long been rumoured to covet the presidency himself, has struck a populist tone in recent weeks, telling TIME he would not be blackmailed by businesses threatening to fire employees if they could not open as \u201cwe will not exchange profits for lives.\u201d\n\nThe governors also argue for the immediate payment of a $115 emergency monthly income for informal workers, the self-employed and those without a fixed income. Bolsonaro reluctantly signed that bill into law on Wednesday but red tape is threatening to hold it up. \u201cEach day that is lost there is a greater risk of having a person die from lack of food,\u201d Doria says. \u201cIt is not the time for bureaucracy. It is time to get the resource into the hands of those in need, to save lives.\u201d\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.

Hundreds of people showed up to pay their respects to the victim in Santarem, a city in Brazil's Amazon region. Despite the loss the atmosphere was festive, with attendees performing a local carimb\u00f3 dance.\n\nTen days later, the local government announced a delayed diagnosis detailing the cause of the woman's death: a coronavirus infection.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus: Brazil is headed toward a 'perfect storm'\n\n\"Santarem could turn into a major epicenter for COVID-19 in the interior of the Amazon,\" said neurosurgeon Erik Jennings. The hospital where he works, Hospital Regional do Baixo Amazonas (HRBA), is already caring for two patients who went to the ceremony. Both have severe symptoms, and one is a confirmed COVID-19 case.\n\nWatch video 02:02 Share Bolsonaro videos pulled Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/3aFXq Facebook, Twitter remove Bolsonaro virus videos\n\nIndigenous patients could overload city hospitals\n\nSantarem is the region's commercial hub, and it welcomes about 300 million tourists per year. And the city is the only specialized treatment option for 1.1 million people in western Para state, a region with a high concentration of indigenous territories.\n\n\"We haven't equipped the villages with the minimum technological or human resources to solve things in these communities,\" said Jennings. \"The structure for the indigenous health system was based on a model that doesn't even work for white people during a pandemic.\"\n\nThere were four confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 3. HRBA only has 20 hospital beds for adults in the intensive care unit and the municipal hospital has seven, meaning Santarem's hospital system could soon be overloaded. That wouldn't only compromise the hospitals' response to the coronavirus outbreak, but also to regular health services.\n\nRead more: Bolsonaro polarizes Brazil with lax coronavirus response\n\nJennings splits his time between the surgical center at the HRBA and a small hospital inside the indigenous territory Zoe, an isolated Amazon community. He first started working in the village as a volunteer 20 years ago, later joining the Health Ministry's Secretariat for Indigenous Health.\n\nSince 2007, the hospital has been conducting complex surgeries and exams that respect the community's worldviews and customs. The pioneering initiative became a point of reference for the United Nations and the Health Ministry when they drew up a list of recommendations to help communities that are isolated or have only recently been contacted.\n\nThe objective of the initiative was to decentralize the hospitals' specialized services in big cities. The current system forces patients to travel, raising the risk of infection for communities that haven't already been exposed to certain diseases and could be decimated by a simple flu.\n\n\"Indigenous people who have to leave their villages to be treated will be exposed on the plane, in the ambulance and then in the hospital where people who don't have COVID-19 will be infected,\" said Jennings.\n\nJennings (left) has been helping to treat remote indigenous people for more than 20 years\n\nDoctors are potential transmitters\n\nNot only do indigenous patients have to be moved to hospitals, but medical professionals are also forced to travel to the villages. The first confirmed COVID-19 case among indigenous communities in Brazil was actually an indigenous health official in Amazon state. She and 26 other people were being monitored after they had had contact with a local doctor who was diagnosed with COVID-19 after returning from a vacation.\n\nIn remote areas of the Amazon, where health teams tend to spend 15 days in the villages, this period has been extended to 30 days. Health care workers then have to isolate in the closest municipality for a fortnight, to reduce the risks caused by traveling. But it remains unclear who will pay for the professionals' accommodation in cities where they don't reside.\n\n\"The teams are very confused. Some professionals are paying for masks out of their own pockets because there's a lack of personal protective equipment. Others are scared of being asymptomatic and bringing the virus to the villages,\" said Marina Corradi, who monitors 16 supervisors of the program Mais Medicos (More Doctors) in northern states.\n\nOn Thursday, the Secretariat of Indigenous Health announced it would distribute rapid testing kits to detect COVID-19 among teams that visit the villages. It also announced that it would buy supplies and more protective gear, to ensure health professionals don't take the virus to communities they are treating.\n\nMeanwhile, the Health Ministry has said the 500,000 rapid tests that have been distributed across Brazil have a 75% chance of error when they test negative for the new coronavirus.\n\nIsolated tribes most vulnerable\n\nAt increased risk are communities that live in complete isolation. Specialists have warned that these ethnicities might be entirely wiped out in a genocide if the virus reaches them, an event that has occurred throughout Brazilian history.\n\nIn late March, federal prosecutors asked police to investigate a report made by indigenous leaders that said American missionary Andrew Tonkin was preparing an expedition to indigenous territories in Javari Valley. The move would go against the no-contact policy for isolated communities enshrined in the Brazilian constitution.\n\nLast October, Brazil's agency for indigenous affairs, Funai, discharged Bruno Pereira, who coordinated the department for isolated communities. He had previously led the biggest expedition to an isolated tribe in the past 20 years, a rare project meant to prevent potential conflict between groups.\n\nRead more: Brazil's indigenous fight back against Bolsonaro's attacks on Amazon\n\nFunai replaced Periera with former evangelical missionary Ricardo Lopes Dias, a decision that caused a furor among activists. Many saw this appointment as an attempt to spread Christianity among indigenous communities.\n\n\"Despite its name \u2014 National Indigenous Foundation \u2014 Funai has abandoned its main objective of protecting and monitoring Brazil's indigenous territories with the current government. It's not a trustworthy agency for us,\" said Nara Bare from the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin.\n\nAs of Friday, there have been 22 suspected cases among indigenous people and 19 dismissed cases. There is one confirmed case in Amazon state.\n\nThe death of the 87-year-old indigenous woman in Santarem is not included in these numbers. The local secretariat said it was only counting the cases of indigenous people who live in remote villages. Those who live in cities are treated by the public health system.\n\nWatch video 12:00 Share Brazil's indigenous population fights back Send Facebook google+ Whatsapp Tumblr linkedin stumble Digg reddit Newsvine Permalink https:\/\/p.dw.com\/p\/36siO Brazil's indigenous population fights back\n\nPandemic overshadows chronic problems\n\nAs Brazilians try to adapt to social distancing measures to slow down the spread of the virus, criminal groups have intensified their activities in indigenous territories.\n\nRead more: Brazil's Bolsonaro proposes bill allowing mining on indigenous land\n\nIllegal mining has increased in the Amazon during the pandemic.

But what\u2019s become increasingly clear is that low number is not because the country has been lucky or particularly effective with preventing the spread of the disease\u2014it\u2019s more likely because local authorities are simply not testing enough people.\n\nThe latest available report by Nigeria\u2019s Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) shows the country had tested only 152 people as of Mar. 22. That\u2019s compared with South Africa which has conducted over 15,500 tests so far despite recording its index case a week later than Nigeria.\n\nFor its part, the NCDC has adopted a strategy of limiting tests to only people already showing symptoms of the disease or have come in contact with confirmed cases. It\u2019s similar to approaches adopted in the United States and the United Kingdom but in comparison to those countries, Nigeria\u2019s test numbers are far lower. The UK had tested over 78,000 people as of Mar. 22.\n\nThe slow pace of Nigeria\u2019s tests is largely down to a lack of capacity. While it can conduct tests locally, Nigeria lacks the manpower or capacity to do so on a very large scale. Indeed, very few countries do: despite ramping up testing in recent days, the UK remains short of its 10,000 tests per day target. The danger however is that, unlike the UK, Nigeria\u2019s public health infrastructure is starkly short on critical medical equipment and facilities to deal with a full-blown outbreak: there are reportedly fewer than 500 ventilators across the entire country.\n\nBeyond low testing figures, there are also questions over Nigeria\u2019s handling of the outbreak since confirming its index case at the end of February. Despite evidence that early confirmed cases comprised mainly of foreign travelers and Nigerians returning from high-risk countries, the Nigerian government did not move to limit incoming international flights until Mar. 23 following widespread calls from civic society groups. Several other African countries had adopted stiffer measures on international flights a week earlier to mitigate the risk of importing the virus.\n\nWhile quarantine is mandatory in countries like Kenya, Ghana and Uganda for nationals and residents coming from high-risk countries, it has largely remained an advisory measure in Nigeria. As a result, health officials are scrambling for contact tracing after travelers on flights that arrived the country, in some cases as far back as ten days ago, test positive. It\u2019s a task made more difficult by the reality that, without functioning databases for contact details, the government will largely rely on public service announcements to find possible contacts. Nigeria\u2019s minister of health has already suggested it\u2019s likely that infected persons are currently in hiding.\n\nThe seeming laxity of Nigeria\u2019s quarantine measures have also been felt at the heart of Nigeria\u2019s seat of power: Abba Kyari, president Muhammadu Buhari\u2019s powerful chief of staff, has tested positive for coronavirus. His infection now raises questions about the status of top government officials as Kyari has attended several high-level government meetings since returning from Germany on Mar. 14 without self-isolating as advised.\n\nSign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox","tests":"['15,500 tests', '10,000 tests']","ventilators":"['500 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

As cases of coronavirus began to rise in Lagos, apprehension flared across the country of almost 200 million.\n\nOf immediate concern was Nigeria\u2019s decrepit health infrastructure, which has been so bad that even the president could not trust it to treat an ear infection.\n\nDuring an appraisal of Nigeria\u2019s readiness, the meeting heard that Nigeria had an estimated 350 intensive care units, according to officials present. Experts estimated Nigeria\u2019s hospitals with Intensive Care Units (ICU) infrastructure at 71, with each having between one to 20 beds.\n\n\u201cThe total number of ICU beds in the country was put at 350,\u201d a source present at the meeting told PREMIUM TIMES, saying the meeting was held in \u201ctop secret\u201d to avoid aggravating Nigerians about insufficient treatment mechanisms available in the country.\n\n\u201cMr Ihekweazu and the rest of us present at the meeting swallowed a bitter pill,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe situation was so helpless that the only thing we could do is to pray that Nigeria\u2019s cases do not rise to the level we have seen in other countries.\u201d\n\nAt the time the meeting held, Nigeria had eight confirmed cases out of 53 people tested, officials said. But as of March 30, 111 cases have been reported with one person confirmed dead from the virus. However, officials said Nigeria had enough personal protective equipment (PPEs) to last for 30 days.\n\nNow, medical experts at the NCDC told PREMIUM TIMES they feared a time when doctors across the country would be faced with a situation where they would need to decide whose lives should be prioritised for the few available ventilators.\n\nThe 71 facilities that NCDC experts found are ICU-equipped contain both public and private hospitals across Nigeria, officials said.\n\nFor weeks, President Muhammadu Buhari declined to address Nigerians on the crisis, isolating himself from other leaders who have been at the frontline of containing the virus around the world.\n\nWhen he eventually addressed the country in a pre-recorded speech on March 29, he did not mention ICUs or ventilators throughout his 20-minute speech. Instead, the president only announced a lockdown of Lagos, Ogun and Abuja for 14 days \u2014 and even that decision has been questioned by legal experts as unconstitutional.\n\nPREMIUM TIMES obtained the information as senior administration officials, including health minister Osagie Ehanire and Mr Ihekweazu himself, have been avoiding questions around the country\u2019s available ICU capacity.\n\nThroughout last week, Messrs Ihekweazu and Enihare, as well as health ministry spokesperson, Enefaa Bob-Manuel, all declined PREMIUM TIMES\u2019 request for comment on the briefing.\n\nPopular demand\n\nAs the fight to contain COVID-19 becomes increasingly intense, countries across the world are racing to expand their ICUs in anticipation of many people who are likely to fall critically ill and overwhelm existing health capacity.\n\nCOVID-19, a highly infectious disease, has been adjudged by medical experts as potentially deadly for people with respiratory and other underlying health conditions.\n\nDemand has risen worldwide for the supply of ventilators, a computerised device that pumps air in and out of the lungs. It has long been a crucial component of an ICU.\n\nPresident Donald Trump spent last week urging U.S. manufacturers to ramp up production of ventilators, with the country tapping into its strategic reserve to cater for the sick in New York, Los Angeles and other densely-populated American cities.\n\nOn Friday, after General Motors announced it might not be able to produce more than 8,000 ventilators between now and April ending, the president invoked defence production laws to compel the major manufacturer to produce thousands more for Americans.\n\nMr Trump estimated that the U.S. may need additional 100,000 ventilators in about 100 days.\n\nHe had previously maintained his reluctance to use his defence production powers, and his breakaway underscores how crucial ventilators are in protecting lives amidst the pandemic.\n\nAcross Europe, demand for ventilators has skyrocketed, with existing tens of thousands of ventilators being deemed insufficient to address growing cases. The situation has prompted some countries to ban exportation of the critical resource in a bid to preserve their own population.\n\n\u2018Hopeless situation\u2019\n\nAs of March 30, Nigeria has confirmed only 111 coronavirus infections amongst its nearly 200 million people, a far cry from the thousands of cases recorded in the U.S. and European countries where ventilators have become a highly prized commodity.\n\nHowever, analysts believe the few cases are due to insufficient testing. While other countries are testing thousands per day, Nigeria has tested less than 500 people so far. On Friday, Mr Ihekweazu admitted during an appearance on Arise TV that the country lacks sufficient kits to ramp up testing of citizens.\n\nThe situation has seen the NCDC carry out tests for political, business and entertainment elite across the country, even when they have not shown symptoms. Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are asked to shelter-in-place until they show serious symptoms.\n\nBut, looking at countries with a superior health infrastructure, including thousands of ICUs and ventilators, scrambling to cope with coronavirus cases in their jurisdictions, experts in Nigeria are worried of dire days ahead.\n\n\u201cLet us be realistic here: Nigerians should expect tough times ahead, and that is even downplaying the severity of what we are likely to face,\u201d Shuaib Musa, a medical doctor in Kaduna, told PREMIUM TIMES.\n\nMr Musa said even the 350 ICU beds that the NCDC estimated for Nigeria would have only a few left that are vacant.\n\n\u201cIf you have up to 10 or 20 ICU beds that are not currently occupied by critically ill patients suffering from other health conditions other than COVID-19, then the country is even lucky,\u201d the medical expert said.\n\nMr Musa said in the entire Kaduna State, only the 44 Reference Hospital and the Nigerian Air Force Base have a few functional ICU beds, which he strongly doubted would be made available to non-military citizens.\n\n\u201cFrom my findings as a medical doctor in this state, Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital either has no functional ICU beds or barely functional ones,\u201d Mr Musa said.\n\nMr Musa said when serious testing commences, Nigeria would likely record thousands of COVID-19 cases and demand for ventilators would rise.\n\n\u201cWe cannot treat them with our existing infrastructure and the money released by the president the other day is only a drop in the bucket,\u201d the doctor said.\n\nNneka Chukwumah, a medical expert at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, told PREMIUM TIMES the outbreak could overwhelm Nigerian hospitals in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cThe hospitals we had before the outbreak were poorly equipped,\u201d Ms Chukwumah said. \u201cBut considering what other countries have been going through, we would simply say Nigerian hospitals would not be able to cope.\u201d\n\nMs Chukwumah, a dental consultant, said Nigerians are being given a false sense of assumption that the infections are still below 100 in Nigeria.\n\n\u201cThey have not been testing,\u201d she said. \u201cThe numbers would have been far higher, otherwise.\u201d\n\nShe said the prevailing approach could cast Nigeria as an unserious country.\n\n\u201cBy now, all hospitals should have had the rapid test kits at least,\u201d she said. \u201cThis would allow doctors to test on the spot once a case is suspected.\u201d\n\nShe said in Edo State, some COVID-19 carriers are still entering public buses to go and seek testing and treatment.\n\n\u201cThey send people to go to Irua to test if they think they might have contracted the virus, now they would enter public transport and before they get to Irua additional people have been exposed,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts at the NCDC meeting estimated Nigeria\u2019s 350 ICU beds meant that one in 285,000 people would have access to critical treatment, using medical practice of calculating half of the population.\n\nLast week, The Punch gathered from across the country that less than 500 ventilators are available, with many hospitals having only a few functional ones.\n\nLatest findings by PREMIUM TIMES showed that only 20 ICU beds are available at National Hospital Abuja, while the University of Benin Teaching Hospital has between six and eight beds.\n\n\u2018Grossly inadequate\u2019\n\nAs of March 27, Mr Buhari has only released about N15 billion ($40 million) for Nigeria\u2019s fight against COVID-19. But in a system that has been moribund for decades, the money is seen by experts as grossly inadequate.\n\n\u201cWithout sugarcoating the situation, the response from the president has been grossly inadequate,\u201d Folashade Adeyemi, an economist, told PREMIUM TIMES. \u201cWe are looking at a situation far more critical than we have ever been in.\u201d\n\nMs Adeyemi said even though the prices of crude had dwindled recently, making revenues difficult for government, COVID-19 should take priority over other government expenditure for now.\n\n\u201cAcross the world, you have seen governments announcing huge stimulus for their citizens, and that is because they realise what damage the virus could cause in the long run,\u201d she added.\n\nMr Buhari\u2019s N15 billion would go to Lagos and the NCDC, but it failed to address critical but expensive medical supplies that may be required.\n\nA few churches and businesses have been making donations towards the country\u2019s health. Earlier this week, Herbert Wigwe and a few other top bankers and business executives donated N1 billion each, to help Nigeria combat the crisis.\n\nInnoson Motors, Nigeria\u2019s indigenous car manufacturer, recently told PREMIUM TIMES it was ready to convert its production lines to making ventilators as part of Nigeria\u2019s response to the crisis. As of Saturday afternoon, no concrete plans had been put in place, even though the company told PREMIUM TIMES representatives of federal and state governments had reached out days ago.\n\n\u201cNigeria does not have a defence production law to implement in the manner we saw with President Trump,\u201d Ms Adeyemi said. \u201cBut there are many steps that could be taken to get the company to start producing as soon as possible.\u201d","tests":null,"ventilators":"['500 ventilators', '8,000 ventilators', '100,000 ventilators']","beds":"['20 ICU beds', '350 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

When 10 million rickshaw drivers, day labourers, factory workers, maids and others raced to get home before the start of the shutdown - announced by the government on 26 March - the city became unnaturally quiet.\n\nDhaka is usually full of the sounds of interaction, energy, and a growing economy. These are the sounds of people earning money; people who were able to get by financially.\n\nWhere are they now? What will they eat? How long can a rickshaw puller like Shumi in Rajshahi, whose family of five subsists on what she can bring home at the end of the day, after she has paid a 350 taka ($4.10) guarantee to the rickshaw owner?\n\nAccording to World Bank data, only 15% of Bangladesh\u2019s population makes more than 500 taka ($5.90) a day. They can meet their daily expenses, send their children to school, and hope that they reserve enough for an emergency health crisis. Most villagers depend on remittances from the cities or abroad. But because this is a global crisis, people everywhere are out of work. Income has stopped.\n\nHow long can they last?\n\nThe US government is now encouraging physical distancing until the end of April. Approximately 75% of US workers have access to paid sick leave, and close to 90% have health insurance. Almost one-third of people could work effectively from home. And yet we still see that, despite all of these forms of social support and benefits, many people are struggling financially with the consequences of COVID-19 policies.\n\nIn Bangladesh - where over 90% of workers are in the informal sector, health insurance is a luxury, and most homes don\u2019t have any sort of internet connectivity - how much more devastating would these policies be here? How many workers making 500 taka a day can work from home?\n\nFor Bangladesh, let\u2019s admit that COVID-19 is a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension. If large-scale physical distancing is required, we must find ways to mitigate the economic shock that will bring the majority of the country into food insecurity within weeks. The urban poor, who live off their daily wages, will have to skip meals. Let\u2019s find ways to keep people safe that also protect their livelihoods. If they absolutely must stay home, we will need to provide food or emergency cash transfers. Assuming that mobile money providers are able to keep their agents active during this time, we have a financial system that goes deep into the villages and could deliver money to almost every household.\n\nWhile there are important lessons to be learned from China, South Korea, Italy and other countries who are deeper into their COVID-19 response than we are, we should also question how much of their policies could be imported here. China\u2019s health expenditure per capita is 10 times that of Bangladesh; Italy\u2019s is eight times higher than China\u2019s.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. People who are staying at home will connect to the world through their smartphones - buying groceries, sending money to loved ones or video chatting with friends to stay mentally positive. The data from smartphones - location information in particular - has proven invaluable in contact tracing. In South Korea, a website that tracks the locations of newly identified cases enables people to see if they have been exposed at the mall or the movies, and to seek testing. Today in China, people get a red, green or yellow message on their phone that lets them know whether they should prepare to leave their home and go to work, based on the latest COVID surveillance data. Contrast this with Bangladesh, where many people struggle to understand text messages, and a recent phone-based COVID-19 survey led to widespread confusion.\n\nWe can seek inspiration from other countries' models, but we should also recognize that many mitigation strategies may be out of our reach. We should also realise - soberingly - that our public healthcare system is already overburdened and that the curve, as is, very skewed and not flattened. According to World Bank data, Bangaldesh has 8 hospital beds for every 10,000 people; by way of comparison, the US has 29 beds per 10,000 people while China has 42.\n\nIt gets worse. The country's entire public health system has 432 ICU beds, only 110 of which are outside the capital Dhaka. The private healthcare sector adds another 737 - and this is for a population of 170 million. Italy has 4.1 doctors on average per 1,000 people whereas Bangladesh has 0.5; that is based on official numbers, and a significant chunk of these doctors are either abroad or not practicing. At Dhaka\u2019s medical college and hospital, the largest government medical facility in the country, over 500 patients seek critical care monthly, and more than 400 are turned away due to lack of capacity.\n\nWe need to think hard about an appropriate public response in a place as densely populated as Bangladesh, where most families\u2019 ability to eat depends on daily wages and 87% of employment is generated by the informal sector. The average household in Bangladesh has more than five members, and usually includes three generations. Families share one latrine and more than 80% of households living in slums share a water source with five or more other households. There is no way to separate the old and the young; in other words, to separate the productive adults from those whose age makes them more vulnerable to serious illness and death. To practice the social distancing norms that most Western countries have relied on to reduce transmission is proving to be culturally completely impossible here. How do you stock up on 30-day supplies when you can only buy a few days\u2019 worth of food? What will you do after that food runs out if your income has been cut off?\n\nWhile I am worried, I also have endless faith in Bangladesh\u2019s ability to rise in a moment of crisis. Even when outsiders see us as a basket case, we see an innovative path forward. When global health experts said that Bengali mothers couldn\u2019t make oral rehydration solution at home and we\u2019d have to import packets of premade solution, which were heavy and difficult to transport to rural villages given the communications infrastructure in the 1980s, we taught families how to prepare 'lobon-gur' (a mixture of local salt and unrefined sugar) and child mortality plunged. When people in villages were dying of tuberculosis because the hospitals were too far away, we found ways to bring testing and treatment to the community level.\n\nCOVID-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world\u2019s best networks of community health workers, a rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['432 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Bangladesh has confirmed 30 cases, with 4 deaths due to corona virus (COVID-19), According to IEDCR officials. (Photo by Salahuddin Ahmed\/Sipa USA)\n\nBangladesh has a health crisis in the making. The lack of preparation in the United States and Europe that has spawned the ongoing crisis there still exceeds the preparedness of developing countries such as Bangladesh, which will have to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with limited financial resources and a legacy of poor healthcare infrastructure, especially for the urban poor. Already one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh also has thousands of stateless Rohingya housed in sprawling refugee camps in the southeastern region of the country, in conditions prime for rapid spread. Given its proximity to China and a large migrant population living in severely affected countries such as Italy, Bangladesh\u2019s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should have taken preventative measures when the Chinese government first shared news of the deadly virus. Unfortunately, precious time was squandered.\n\nAfter the first reported death in Bangladesh from COVID-19, there was a mass religious gathering in the southern part of the country attended by tens of thousands of people. Such events have been discouraged by authorities but communications need to be clearer and more forceful to be effective. Currently there is a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, during which the army is enforcing social distancing across the nation. There are several potential policies the Bangladeshi government can use in its response strategy to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s health and economic impact on Bangladesh.\n\nThe current situation\n\nThe Bangladeshi research institute spearheading the fight to test and detect coronavirus is the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), a body under the Ministry of Health. The IEDCR has recommended that citizens avoid mass public gatherings. Yet, for the March 17 birth centenary of the country\u2019s founder, Sheikh Mijibur Rahman, the government arranged two major public events in Dhaka. These events were supposedly more scaled down from their original intended size, but even so they was still packed with thousands of celebrants, live music, and fireworks.\n\nUnlike in neighboring Nepal where the army set up a quarantine facility in Kathmandu as per the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) recommendation upon the first positive COVID-19 test, the handling of quarantine measures in Bangladesh was inadequate. When the first batch of mass returnees arrived from China in February, they were all quarantined at the Ashkana Hajj Camp in Dhaka. The returnees complained about subpar conditions, including poor hygienic conditions and being crammed in small spaces. However, the authorities ignored the situation and the health risks it posed to those in quarantine. Subsequently, in mid-March when the second batch of foreign returnees\u2014over a hundred and forty Bangladeshis evacuated from Italy\u2014arrived, confusion ensued when they were taken to the same inadequate quarantine spot. These returnees protested and were ultimately allowed to leave with the promise of \u201chome quarantine.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, tens of thousands of people gathered in Raipur in the southern district of Lakshmipur to pray \u201chealing verses\u201d from the Quran. This event was organized by an influential local religious leader who urged people to join this event, promising a way to be \u201cfree from the coronavirus.\u201d The same week, school holidays were announced to support the quarantine, but domestic tourist destinations such as the coastal areas of Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar were all bustling with people and activity. On March 20, the Islamic Foundation allowed congregational prayers to go on albeit for a shortened length.\n\nSuch contradiction in policy guidance and lack-luster enforcement has wasted precious time for the government to shore up its limited public health system and to implement best practices for maximizing social distancing and minimizing community transmission of the novel coronavirus. The impact on Bangladesh\u2019s economy due to these missteps is likely to be significant.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that export industries will suffer and the country will lose 1.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) growth due to the pandemic. The ready-made garments sector which accounts for more than 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing income has already suffered a loss of $3 billion as major export destinations such as the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union are cancelling orders. In addition, foreign remittances representing over 5 percent of GDP (close to $17 billion in fiscal year 2019) will be affected as half a million migrant workers have returned home since the outbreak. The majority of these migrant workers were based in Middle Eastern countries which have been hit by declining oil prices. Furthermore, daily wage laborers, such as rickshaw-pullers, are the hardest hit as the closure of schools and colleges have led to lower demand for their services. For these workers\u2014who survive hand to mouth daily\u2014the consequences of quarantines and lockdowns, however medically necessary, are dire without robust government provision of food and supplementary income.\n\nSome encouraging news\n\nBangladesh\u2019s government is hardly alone in not tackling the pandemic early enough. Fortunately, after a slow start, the government has begun to show signs of urgency. Following the mass religious gathering in southern Bangladesh, the government started enforcing social distancing measures. Local administrations have been told to punish violators of the home-quarantine rules in line with Section 269 of the Penal Code. Additionally, an emergency lockdown has been imposed in the sub-district of Shibchar since March 19 where many returnees from Italy are based. The general secretary of the ruling party Awami League, Obaidul Quader, said that in the future there may be a possibility of further lockdowns in other areas. Most recently, the government declared a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, wherein all government and private offices have been closed, and with the army mobilized to enforce social distancing across the nation. Almost all international flights have been suspended until April 7 and the country\u2019s March 26 Independence Day celebrations were subdued.\n\nThe government encouraged low-income people to return to their villages where they would be provided with government aid or to take refuge in Bhashanchar, an island in the Bay of Bengal originally built to house Rohingya refugees. On March 20, the government authorized the Bangladesh Army to run two quarantine centers in Dhaka. One quarantine facility remains the same Ashkona Hajj Camp that has proved inadequate before. The other is a new one at Rajuk Apartment Project near Diyabari in Uttara.\n\nIn the medical arena, there has been progress as well. Isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients have been set up in district-level hospitals across the country. Students and teachers of the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Dhaka have started making low-cost hand sanitizers due to market shortages in the wake of coronavirus fears. And, Gonoshasthaya Kendra, a public health center in Dhaka, received approval from the country\u2019s Directorate of Drug Administration (DGDA) to mass-produce COVID-19 detection kits, each costing around $3.\n\nRecommendations for tackling the situation\n\nPolicymakers in Bangladesh should gear up in anticipation of a deterioration of the situation. While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has promised a $6.5 billion package to address the immediate needs of developing member countries (DMCs), and India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged $10 million toward a special emergency fund to set up a rapid response team for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh will have to face this battle largely on its own. Over the past ten days, the South Asia Center has consulted broadly with public health professionals and social scientists who study Bangladesh. Those conversations lead us to offer the following healthcare, social, and economic recommendations:\n\nHealth Care\n\nSupport initiatives to increase the local production of medical gloves, masks, and other medical kits for health care practitioners who, as the front line defenders, are the most vulnerable. According to Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque, as of now, Bangladesh has adequate testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE), numbering around two hundred thousand units. On March 26, a large consignment of emergency medical supplies provided by the Chinese government arrived. This shipment included 10,000 testing reagents, 15,000 surgical masks, 10,000 medical protective equipment, and 1,000 infrared thermometers. But, as the grim lessons from other countries make clear, in the case of a mass outbreak, even more PPE will be required and more testing needs to be done.\n\nCOVID-19 testing facilities should be made available across both public and private medical centers with immediate effect. Once locally produced full-scale standardized and accurate kits are available, testing capabilities should be distributed to other locations in Dhaka and across the country. Bangladesh should commit to mass testing on about one percent of its population to identify community spread of COVID-19. As of March 29, Bangladesh\u2019s official COVID-19 tracker confirms forty-eight cases and five deaths. A press conference that day stated that 1,185 tests have been conducted thus far. This number is much lower in comparison to India and Pakistan, who as of March 29, have tested 27,688 and 14,336 cases respectively.\n\nImplement awareness campaigns for the general public. Unless an individual is over sixty-five and\/or has pre-existing health conditions, symptoms should be followed by a six to seven-day quarantine period and individuals should not go to health care facilities. If an individual\u2019s health condition continues to deteriorate, they should then go for COVID-19 testing.\n\nEmotional and mental health services, as well as financial support, should be provided for health workers. The medical community of the nation at this point are severely at high risk and are fearful.\n\nSocial\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs should endorse the fatwa of the Council of Senior Scholars at Al-Azhar, one of the Muslim world\u2019s top Islamic institutions, where it is permitted under Sharia Law to suspend congregational prayers to counter the spread of the virus. Many Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East including Saudi Arabia have banned gatherings such as in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nRestaurants and public locations should remain closed after April 4 for a period of at least another ten days, and citizens should be prepared for even longer disruptions of daily life. There must be tougher self-quarantine norms\u2014and if needed lockdown measures\u2014in certain areas of the country with higher concentrations of Bangladeshi expatriates. Sri Lanka had instituted a stay-at-home curfew in eight districts of the country, where violation of this measure has led to the arrest of over 1,600 people. Now that the army has been summoned in Bangladesh, certain districts across the country can be asked to impose curfew-like restrictions, with violations leading to strict punishment and fines.\n\nThe government must utilize television, radio, and social media to counter the spread of fraudulent treatment methods through disinformation channels, and to raise appropriate awareness of COVID-19\u2019s dangers for even otherwise healthy victims.\n\nVillage community leaders such as Imams and village elders should be involved in spreading information on countering COVID-19. Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government officials have a list of such leaders and can centrally coordinate their response.\n\nPrivate universities should be mobilized to provide premises for quarantine facilities and temporary hospitals, given that many of them have campuses located right outside Dhaka. Similar initiatives have been taken by higher educational institutions in the United States.\n\nEconomic\n\nTo protect daily wage laborers who have not left Dhaka to return to their hometowns, tougher lockdown measures accompanied by supportive humanitarian measures should be implemented in slum areas where daily wage workers are concentrated. As in the Rohingya camps, daily wage laborers should be provided with rations for two weeks so that they can observe social distancing measures without risk of starvation or malnutrition. Such a policy could build on the precedent by the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, which will provide free rations to the poor until September. Additionally, as the month of Ramadan is approaching, zakat funds should be collected by both the government and NGOs for this purpose\n\nThe government must provide the necessary financing to allow Gonoshasthaya Kendra and other health care organizations to produce their COVID-19 testing kits at requisite volumes and support distributional channels to allow medical facilities around the country to access these kits.\n\nThe government must help catalyze the funding required to enable the local production of hand sanitizers and PPEs, which are being made by university students and small tech companies. This will disincentivize counterfeiting and fraud.\n\nOver the next six months, the government must ensure that strategies suggested by the ADB and other international organizations are implemented without delay to minimize the inevitable economic slowdown that will follow even a successful fight against the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a once-in-a-generation pathogen that has proven capable of bringing the health systems of the richest countries of the world to their knees. The damage that will be wrought on developing country populations if their governments delay implementation of aggressive countermeasures is unimaginable. Living in densely populated areas with large sections of society reliant on daily wages to make ends meet\u2014and served by public health systems that have been deprived of investment for decades\u2014Bangladeshi citizens are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable to the unchecked spread of this disease.

In comparison, South Korea tests 8,996 for every million people, Singapore 6,666, and Malaysia 1,605.\n\nAsked by The Straits Times on Monday (April 6) about Indonesia's very low rate, Mr Achmad Yurianto, a government spokesman for Covid-19 management, said: \"We don't test based on the size of population, but based on contact tracing of positive cases as well as based on the visits to health facilities by people with Covid-19 symptoms.\"\n\nHe added that Indonesia is also doing rapid tests, but the number of such tests - and the number of any confirmation tests after this procedure - do not add to the Covid-19 national tallies.\n\nHe stressed that such rapid tests, which are not as reliable as the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, are used only to help with early \"screening\" of people who may have contracted the virus.\n\nAny close contact who is tested negative using a rapid test kit must redo the procedure after a period of time, while anyone testing positive would have to be confirmed by a PCR test.\n\nRapid tests are antibody tests, which determines whether a person has developed immunity to the coronavirus. These tests, however, have a limited role in diagnosis, according to experts, as it takes the body four days or longer after infection to produce antibodies, which would be too late for the purpose of quick detection and contact tracing.\n\nIndonesia's ranking among the likes of Ethiopia comes as a surprise as the South-east Asia's largest economy has a GDP that is at least three times larger than any of the three bottom-ranked countries. Indonesia\u2019s GDP per capita, often used as an indicator of a country\u2019s standard of living, is at least double.\n\nIndonesia has a GDP of USD$1.1 trillion (S$ 1.58 trillion), while Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nigeria has a GDP of US$81 billion, US$250 billion, and US$375 billion, respectively.\n\nIndonesia's health ministry has been widely criticised for red tape in bringing in test kits, as well as equipment to read the PCR test samples.\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus: West Java governor calls on Jakarta residents to stay home during Ramadan\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic\n\nRecent media reports have also pointed out that the ministry's official Covid-19 death toll nationwide, currently at 209, is an understated figure contradicted by separate announcements by local governments in West Java and the Jakarta municipal government, which indicate a higher toll. This has raised questions about the health ministry's transparency and credibility in disclosing data, the local media has reported.\n\nJakarta, where about half of the national confirmed cases are from, issued a monthly figure on burials in the capital for March at 4,377, well above the monthly average of 2,745 burials last year and 2,774 burials the year before.\n\nOn April 2, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said 401 burials were conducted following the Covid-19 protocol. The national tally shows the fatality in Jakarta as only 99.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah is among currencies that have weakened sharply against the US dollar as the coronavirus crisis deepened. The rupiah fell 15 per cent year on year on April 6, while other currencies that have seen sharp falls in the same period include the Mexican peso, which dropped 26 per cent, and the Russian rouble, 19 per cent.\n\nSome of these countries have spent a lot of their foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the currency markets. Experts, however, have argued that uncertainty and a lack of credibility pose the greatest threat to these countries' currency values, and improving transparency in their Covid-19 data and boosting testing rates would be the most effective measures to address their currency depreciation woes.","tests":"['16 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The premier, at the meeting, suggested to collect samples from various areas across the country to get a clearer picture on Covid-19 situation in Bangladesh.\n\nThe move comes from DGHS at a time when thousands of panic-gripped people wait in queues outside the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), requesting them to test their samples, but the authorities continue to decline most of them, saying that no tests are required for people with only flu or cough like symptoms.\n\nAccording to IEDCR, tests are conducted on suspects such as returned expatriates showing symptoms; persons exposed to someone who has already tested positive; symptomatic people aged over 60 having comorbidity; symptomatic people with any pre-existing condition; persons having atypical pneumonia; serious hospitalized patients with corona syndromes; professionals with symptoms who came into contact with different walks of people.\n\nSouth Korea is the ideal example of how to slow down the spread of the virus \u2013 isolate people, and test them as much as possible.

These machines are costly and sophisticated,\u201d Health Minister Zahid Maleque told BenarNews.\n\nBangladesh, a nation of about 165 million people, has \u201cslightly more than 1,475 ventilators\u201d at all of its government-run and private hospitals, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is very hard to give an exact number for ventilators as some machines remain in operation and some remain out of order or under maintenance,\u201d Maleque said. \u201cIn addition, we have ordered 300 ventilators from European manufacturers. These have been in the pipeline.\u201d\n\nAccording to the minister, not all patients afflicted with the coronavirus need to be hooked up to these devices, which help patients breathe.\n\n\u201cThe elderly patients with severe respiratory problems need ventilators. Ordinary coronavirus patients do not need ventilators,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Bangladeshi health experts contacted by BenarNews on Monday said these machines were essential for treating patients suffering from COVID-19, because the virus attacks people\u2019s lungs.\n\n\u201c[V]entilators actually provide alternative support to the respiratory system of the COVID-19 patients. In most of the cases, ventilators are a must for treating COVID-19 patients,\u201d said Dr. Md Nazrul Islam, a professor of virology at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), a state-run institution.\n\nThere is a shortage of ventilators nationwide, and not all intensive care units at hospitals are equipped with those machines, he said. The hospital associated with the university where he teaches is considered one of the best centers of medicine in Bangladesh, but it has only 30 ventilators, he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to increase the number of ventilators as the number of patients continues to grow,\u201d Islam said.\n\nOn Monday, Bangladeshi health authorities reported the single largest daily spike to date in confirmed COVID-19 cases, saying 35 new cases were detected, bringing the national total to 123. Three new fatalities from the virus were also recorded, bringing the official national death toll to 12.\n\nEarly in the day, Save The Children warned that hospitals in Bangladesh may not be able to cope under pressure from the pandemic as it eventually strains the country\u2019s supply of ventilators.\n\n\u201cAt present it is difficult for Bangladesh to meet the expected surge in demand for ventilators to help respond to the COVID-19 outbreak,\u201d Shamim Jahan, the NGO\u2019s deputy country director in Bangladesh, said in a news release issued by Save The Children.\n\n\u201cWe are in this together \u2013 no single country can confront COVID-19 alone, even the richest and most powerful among us. It is therefore essential that world leaders \u2013 in particular the G20 countries \u2013 commit to a coordinated global plan under-pinned by debt relief. We also urge the Bangladesh government to engage the public and private sectors urgently to secure ventilators for COVID-19 patients,\u201d Jahan said.\n\n\u2018No ventilators in Cox\u2019s Bazar\u2019\n\nThe densely populated southeastern district of Cox\u2019s Bazar \u2013 home to sprawling camps that house more than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar \u2013 is particularly vulnerable to the viral outbreak, Save The Children said.\n\n\u201cThe acute scarcity of ventilators in the district means lives will be lost when COVID-19 starts to spread more widely in the community,\u201d The NGO said.\n\nBut in fact, according to Dr. Mahbubur Rahman, head of the district\u2019s health office, \u201cthere are no ventilators in Cox\u2019s Bazar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe detected one coronavirus patient and referred the patient to Dhaka where she completely recovered,\u201d he told BenarNews. \u201cBut we feel that Cox\u2019s Bazar hospitals should have an adequate number of ventilators.\u201d\n\nRahman said the victim was a Bangladeshi woman who had returned from Saudi Arabia. So far, no Rohingya have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\u201cBut we have already requested that authorities allocate ventilators for Cox\u2019s Bazar hospitals to meet an emergency,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, at the national level, help could be coming from Bangladeshi businesses assisted by a major international manufacturer of ventilators.\n\nIn a Facebook post on March 31, the state minister for information and communication technology said Medtronic, an Ireland-based company led by a Bangladeshi man, had released software source codes and hardware designs to Bangladesh\u2019s government.\n\nMinister Zunaid Ahmed Palak said local companies Walton, MyOne, Celltron, a2i Innovation Lab, MIST, Minister Electronics, Startup Bangladesh and iDEA were using that information to produce ventilators.\n\nWorldwide more than 70,500 people have died and nearly 1.3 million have been infected from the coronavirus, according to the latest data compiled by disease experts at Johns Hopkins University in the United States.\n\n\u201cWithout access to intensive care facilities in Cox\u2019s Bazar, patients in critical condition may have to be transported to neighboring Chittagong district 150 kilometers [93.2 miles] away, further increasing the risk to them and others,\" said Athena Rayburn, the Rohingya Response Advocacy manager for Save The Children.\n\n\"Ventilators and people trained to operate them are urgently needed to protect the host communities and Rohingya refugees to avert a humanitarian disaster if we start to see community-level transmission of COVID-19. Children are at serious risk of contracting the virus, but also of being orphaned or neglected if family members become infected or die,\u201d she said.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['1,475 ventilators', '1,500 ventilators', '30 ventilators', '300 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

When 10 million rickshaw drivers, day labourers, factory workers, maids and others raced to get home before the start of the shutdown - announced by the government on 26 March - the city became unnaturally quiet.\n\nDhaka is usually full of the sounds of interaction, energy, and a growing economy. These are the sounds of people earning money; people who were able to get by financially.\n\nWhere are they now? What will they eat? How long can a rickshaw puller like Shumi in Rajshahi, whose family of five subsists on what she can bring home at the end of the day, after she has paid a 350 taka ($4.10) guarantee to the rickshaw owner?\n\nAccording to World Bank data, only 15% of Bangladesh\u2019s population makes more than 500 taka ($5.90) a day. They can meet their daily expenses, send their children to school, and hope that they reserve enough for an emergency health crisis. Most villagers depend on remittances from the cities or abroad. But because this is a global crisis, people everywhere are out of work. Income has stopped.\n\nHow long can they last?\n\nThe US government is now encouraging physical distancing until the end of April. Approximately 75% of US workers have access to paid sick leave, and close to 90% have health insurance. Almost one-third of people could work effectively from home. And yet we still see that, despite all of these forms of social support and benefits, many people are struggling financially with the consequences of COVID-19 policies.\n\nIn Bangladesh - where over 90% of workers are in the informal sector, health insurance is a luxury, and most homes don\u2019t have any sort of internet connectivity - how much more devastating would these policies be here? How many workers making 500 taka a day can work from home?\n\nFor Bangladesh, let\u2019s admit that COVID-19 is a humanitarian crisis with a public health dimension. If large-scale physical distancing is required, we must find ways to mitigate the economic shock that will bring the majority of the country into food insecurity within weeks. The urban poor, who live off their daily wages, will have to skip meals. Let\u2019s find ways to keep people safe that also protect their livelihoods. If they absolutely must stay home, we will need to provide food or emergency cash transfers. Assuming that mobile money providers are able to keep their agents active during this time, we have a financial system that goes deep into the villages and could deliver money to almost every household.\n\nWhile there are important lessons to be learned from China, South Korea, Italy and other countries who are deeper into their COVID-19 response than we are, we should also question how much of their policies could be imported here. China\u2019s health expenditure per capita is 10 times that of Bangladesh; Italy\u2019s is eight times higher than China\u2019s.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t stop there. People who are staying at home will connect to the world through their smartphones - buying groceries, sending money to loved ones or video chatting with friends to stay mentally positive. The data from smartphones - location information in particular - has proven invaluable in contact tracing. In South Korea, a website that tracks the locations of newly identified cases enables people to see if they have been exposed at the mall or the movies, and to seek testing. Today in China, people get a red, green or yellow message on their phone that lets them know whether they should prepare to leave their home and go to work, based on the latest COVID surveillance data. Contrast this with Bangladesh, where many people struggle to understand text messages, and a recent phone-based COVID-19 survey led to widespread confusion.\n\nWe can seek inspiration from other countries' models, but we should also recognize that many mitigation strategies may be out of our reach. We should also realise - soberingly - that our public healthcare system is already overburdened and that the curve, as is, very skewed and not flattened. According to World Bank data, Bangaldesh has 8 hospital beds for every 10,000 people; by way of comparison, the US has 29 beds per 10,000 people while China has 42.\n\nIt gets worse. The country's entire public health system has 432 ICU beds, only 110 of which are outside the capital Dhaka. The private healthcare sector adds another 737 - and this is for a population of 170 million. Italy has 4.1 doctors on average per 1,000 people whereas Bangladesh has 0.5; that is based on official numbers, and a significant chunk of these doctors are either abroad or not practicing. At Dhaka\u2019s medical college and hospital, the largest government medical facility in the country, over 500 patients seek critical care monthly, and more than 400 are turned away due to lack of capacity.\n\nWe need to think hard about an appropriate public response in a place as densely populated as Bangladesh, where most families\u2019 ability to eat depends on daily wages and 87% of employment is generated by the informal sector. The average household in Bangladesh has more than five members, and usually includes three generations. Families share one latrine and more than 80% of households living in slums share a water source with five or more other households. There is no way to separate the old and the young; in other words, to separate the productive adults from those whose age makes them more vulnerable to serious illness and death. To practice the social distancing norms that most Western countries have relied on to reduce transmission is proving to be culturally completely impossible here. How do you stock up on 30-day supplies when you can only buy a few days\u2019 worth of food? What will you do after that food runs out if your income has been cut off?\n\nWhile I am worried, I also have endless faith in Bangladesh\u2019s ability to rise in a moment of crisis. Even when outsiders see us as a basket case, we see an innovative path forward. When global health experts said that Bengali mothers couldn\u2019t make oral rehydration solution at home and we\u2019d have to import packets of premade solution, which were heavy and difficult to transport to rural villages given the communications infrastructure in the 1980s, we taught families how to prepare 'lobon-gur' (a mixture of local salt and unrefined sugar) and child mortality plunged. When people in villages were dying of tuberculosis because the hospitals were too far away, we found ways to bring testing and treatment to the community level.\n\nCOVID-19 is new and different in important ways, but we are home to premiere public health experts and institutions. We have one of the world\u2019s best networks of community health workers, a rich history of public-private partnerships in emergencies, and communities with incredible levels of resilience.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['432 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Country Level 1 is when no case is detected in the country, Country Level 2 is when imported cases and limited human to human transmission will be reported, Country Level 3 is when there is a cluster of cases and Country Level 4 is when community transmission is reported.\n\nThe Bangladesh government published the plan when no patient was tested positive for Covid-19. However, Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) is now hinting on a limited scale community level transmission, which means Bangladesh is now possibly heading towards Country Level 4 categorization.\n\nThe Bangladesh government on Monday announced that 35 people were tested positive, which is so far the highest number of Covid-19 infected patients since March 8.\n\nThe plan stressed on the importance of screening passengers at the airport a couple of times. However, it stirred criticism when a few thermal scanner machines were reported to be faulty.\n\nThe DGHS DG Abul Kalam Azad said the government started screening the suspects at the airport, along with the arrangement of dedicated quarantine zones for people arriving from the affected countries since January.\n\nAs of Sunday, Bangladesh has screened a total of 6,67,777 passengers, data compiled by DGHS shows.\n\nMajor highlights of the plan\n\nThe plan has a chapter on risk communication which says misinformation on all relevant channels, including traditional media and social media, will be countered.\n\nThe government has done some work on that front, however, it stirred criticism when the information ministry assigned some of its officials to monitor broadcast media to check whether the media is spreading rumors and misinformation.\n\nPreventing mass gathering was one of the highlights of the national plan but the government received a lot of criticism because right after announcing the general holiday, thousands of people rushed to home in crowded public transportation.\n\nThe government requested people to stay at home but it did not halt the public transportation.\n\nThe plan states that religious leaders would be sensitized to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. However, the plan does not mention anything clearly about halting religious gathering in mosques, temples, churches or any other place.\n\nBangladesh made international headlines when at least 25,000 people performed a prayer named Khatme Shifa or Ayat ash-Shifa (Six Quranic Verses of Healing) to seek the containment of the pandemic Covid-19 at the Central Eidgah of Lakshmipur's Raipur on March 18.\n\nTill Sunday, there was no government instruction to halt religious gathering, although the plan states that mass gathering should be prevented if Bangladesh reaches to level three.\n\nHowever, Islamic Foundation issued a guideline where they requested Imams to continue five-time prayers and Jummah prayers at mosques with limited number of people.\n\nOn Monday, the Religious Affairs Ministry issued an emergency notice, suspending prayers at mosques across the country in a bid to stop further spread of Covid-19.\n\nQuarantining, isolating suspects\n\nAs for quarantined people, the plan says: \u201cAccording to guideline provision of accommodation, food and other necessary supplies will be provided. The Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief will be responsible along with other stakeholders for this.\u201d\n\nHowever, it did not really elaborate anything about providing supplies for people in home quarantine. It did say, people who have come from abroad must quarantine themselves at their home for 14 days.\n\nHowever, several media reports revealed that a number of people were not following government instructions and socializing outside before completing their home quarantine period. Lax monitoring of the government was criticized.\n\nThe plan states: \u201cPrepare the isolation wards at the designated health facilities -- Kurmitola General Hospital, Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) and Bangladesh Kuwait Moitree Hospital--for isolation and treatment of suspected Covid-19 cases.\n\n\u201cPrepare isolation units in all governmental hospitals; Ensure all private hospitals and clinics are instructed to prepare isolation units at their respective premises.\u201d\n\nHowever, it did not say how many isolation units are needed if the situation gets worse. It is not clear if those facilities are sufficient for Bangladesh, a country with 167.2 million people.\n\nThe plan also suggested to establish intensive care capacity at the divisional and district levels.\n\nCurrently, hospitals in Bangladesh have only 1,169 ICU beds (432 govt, 737 private) in total against a population of 161,356,039 people.\n\nAt present, only around 34 ICU beds are ready to be used at Bangladesh Kuwait Moitree Hospital and Sheikh Rasel Gastro Liver Institute & Hospital. Besides, 11 more ICU beds are prepared at three private hospitals.\n\nHealth and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque earlier said the government has prepared 200 ICU units for Covid-19 patients, while 11 labs have been set up for testing samples of suspected coronavirus cases.\n\n\u201cAs many as 28 more labs will be set up as part of our effort to expand the Covid-19 test facilities across the country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018Bangladesh is now on right track to curb the outbreak\u2019\n\nAmid the allegations by some quarters regarding prior preparation to combat novel coronavirus, DGHS DG Prof Dr Abul Kalam Azad claimed it is not true as the government acted very seriously from the very outset of this global crisis to halt the outbreak of the lethal disease in Bangladesh.\n\nOn April, the DG said Bangladesh is now on the right track to curb the outbreak of the Covid-19, reports BSS.\n\n\"We prepared designated hospitals, and equipped our health professionals with necessary facilities,\" he claimed.\n\nProf Abul Kalam Azad said the government closed down all educational institutions in the country, locked down infection-prone areas to prevent community transmission and advised the people to stay at home.\n\nThe DG said six hospitals have been prepared in Dhaka for coronavirus patients, while arrangements are underway to treat coronavirus patients in five more hospitals of the capital.\n\n\"Separate beds have been kept ready for such patients in district and upazila level hospitals,\" he added.\n\nAs of Monday, Bangladesh has reported 12 deaths and 123 infections of Covid-19.\n\nThe fast spreading coronavirus, which was first reported in China's Wuhan, has claimed above 69,501 lives and infected more than 1,275,000 people across the world till date, according to Worldometers.\n\nAs many as 265,887 people have recovered from coronavirus infection, a pandemic declared by World Health Organization (WHO), which has spread to 208 countries and territories across the planet.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['34 ICU beds', '1,169 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Bangladesh has confirmed 30 cases, with 4 deaths due to corona virus (COVID-19), According to IEDCR officials. (Photo by Salahuddin Ahmed\/Sipa USA)\n\nBangladesh has a health crisis in the making. The lack of preparation in the United States and Europe that has spawned the ongoing crisis there still exceeds the preparedness of developing countries such as Bangladesh, which will have to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with limited financial resources and a legacy of poor healthcare infrastructure, especially for the urban poor. Already one of the most densely populated countries in the world, Bangladesh also has thousands of stateless Rohingya housed in sprawling refugee camps in the southeastern region of the country, in conditions prime for rapid spread. Given its proximity to China and a large migrant population living in severely affected countries such as Italy, Bangladesh\u2019s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare should have taken preventative measures when the Chinese government first shared news of the deadly virus. Unfortunately, precious time was squandered.\n\nAfter the first reported death in Bangladesh from COVID-19, there was a mass religious gathering in the southern part of the country attended by tens of thousands of people. Such events have been discouraged by authorities but communications need to be clearer and more forceful to be effective. Currently there is a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, during which the army is enforcing social distancing across the nation. There are several potential policies the Bangladeshi government can use in its response strategy to blunt the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s health and economic impact on Bangladesh.\n\nThe current situation\n\nThe Bangladeshi research institute spearheading the fight to test and detect coronavirus is the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), a body under the Ministry of Health. The IEDCR has recommended that citizens avoid mass public gatherings. Yet, for the March 17 birth centenary of the country\u2019s founder, Sheikh Mijibur Rahman, the government arranged two major public events in Dhaka. These events were supposedly more scaled down from their original intended size, but even so they was still packed with thousands of celebrants, live music, and fireworks.\n\nUnlike in neighboring Nepal where the army set up a quarantine facility in Kathmandu as per the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) recommendation upon the first positive COVID-19 test, the handling of quarantine measures in Bangladesh was inadequate. When the first batch of mass returnees arrived from China in February, they were all quarantined at the Ashkana Hajj Camp in Dhaka. The returnees complained about subpar conditions, including poor hygienic conditions and being crammed in small spaces. However, the authorities ignored the situation and the health risks it posed to those in quarantine. Subsequently, in mid-March when the second batch of foreign returnees\u2014over a hundred and forty Bangladeshis evacuated from Italy\u2014arrived, confusion ensued when they were taken to the same inadequate quarantine spot. These returnees protested and were ultimately allowed to leave with the promise of \u201chome quarantine.\u201d\n\nOn March 18, tens of thousands of people gathered in Raipur in the southern district of Lakshmipur to pray \u201chealing verses\u201d from the Quran. This event was organized by an influential local religious leader who urged people to join this event, promising a way to be \u201cfree from the coronavirus.\u201d The same week, school holidays were announced to support the quarantine, but domestic tourist destinations such as the coastal areas of Chittagong and Cox\u2019s Bazar were all bustling with people and activity. On March 20, the Islamic Foundation allowed congregational prayers to go on albeit for a shortened length.\n\nSuch contradiction in policy guidance and lack-luster enforcement has wasted precious time for the government to shore up its limited public health system and to implement best practices for maximizing social distancing and minimizing community transmission of the novel coronavirus. The impact on Bangladesh\u2019s economy due to these missteps is likely to be significant.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that export industries will suffer and the country will lose 1.1% of its gross domestic product (GDP) growth due to the pandemic. The ready-made garments sector which accounts for more than 80 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing income has already suffered a loss of $3 billion as major export destinations such as the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union are cancelling orders. In addition, foreign remittances representing over 5 percent of GDP (close to $17 billion in fiscal year 2019) will be affected as half a million migrant workers have returned home since the outbreak. The majority of these migrant workers were based in Middle Eastern countries which have been hit by declining oil prices. Furthermore, daily wage laborers, such as rickshaw-pullers, are the hardest hit as the closure of schools and colleges have led to lower demand for their services. For these workers\u2014who survive hand to mouth daily\u2014the consequences of quarantines and lockdowns, however medically necessary, are dire without robust government provision of food and supplementary income.\n\nSome encouraging news\n\nBangladesh\u2019s government is hardly alone in not tackling the pandemic early enough. Fortunately, after a slow start, the government has begun to show signs of urgency. Following the mass religious gathering in southern Bangladesh, the government started enforcing social distancing measures. Local administrations have been told to punish violators of the home-quarantine rules in line with Section 269 of the Penal Code. Additionally, an emergency lockdown has been imposed in the sub-district of Shibchar since March 19 where many returnees from Italy are based. The general secretary of the ruling party Awami League, Obaidul Quader, said that in the future there may be a possibility of further lockdowns in other areas. Most recently, the government declared a ten-day nationwide holiday from March 26 to April 4, wherein all government and private offices have been closed, and with the army mobilized to enforce social distancing across the nation. Almost all international flights have been suspended until April 7 and the country\u2019s March 26 Independence Day celebrations were subdued.\n\nThe government encouraged low-income people to return to their villages where they would be provided with government aid or to take refuge in Bhashanchar, an island in the Bay of Bengal originally built to house Rohingya refugees. On March 20, the government authorized the Bangladesh Army to run two quarantine centers in Dhaka. One quarantine facility remains the same Ashkona Hajj Camp that has proved inadequate before. The other is a new one at Rajuk Apartment Project near Diyabari in Uttara.\n\nIn the medical arena, there has been progress as well. Isolation wards to treat COVID-19 patients have been set up in district-level hospitals across the country. Students and teachers of the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Dhaka have started making low-cost hand sanitizers due to market shortages in the wake of coronavirus fears. And, Gonoshasthaya Kendra, a public health center in Dhaka, received approval from the country\u2019s Directorate of Drug Administration (DGDA) to mass-produce COVID-19 detection kits, each costing around $3.\n\nRecommendations for tackling the situation\n\nPolicymakers in Bangladesh should gear up in anticipation of a deterioration of the situation. While the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has promised a $6.5 billion package to address the immediate needs of developing member countries (DMCs), and India\u2019s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has pledged $10 million toward a special emergency fund to set up a rapid response team for the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Bangladesh will have to face this battle largely on its own. Over the past ten days, the South Asia Center has consulted broadly with public health professionals and social scientists who study Bangladesh. Those conversations lead us to offer the following healthcare, social, and economic recommendations:\n\nHealth Care\n\nSupport initiatives to increase the local production of medical gloves, masks, and other medical kits for health care practitioners who, as the front line defenders, are the most vulnerable. According to Health and Family Welfare Minister Zahid Maleque, as of now, Bangladesh has adequate testing kits and personal protective equipment (PPE), numbering around two hundred thousand units. On March 26, a large consignment of emergency medical supplies provided by the Chinese government arrived. This shipment included 10,000 testing reagents, 15,000 surgical masks, 10,000 medical protective equipment, and 1,000 infrared thermometers. But, as the grim lessons from other countries make clear, in the case of a mass outbreak, even more PPE will be required and more testing needs to be done.\n\nCOVID-19 testing facilities should be made available across both public and private medical centers with immediate effect. Once locally produced full-scale standardized and accurate kits are available, testing capabilities should be distributed to other locations in Dhaka and across the country. Bangladesh should commit to mass testing on about one percent of its population to identify community spread of COVID-19. As of March 29, Bangladesh\u2019s official COVID-19 tracker confirms forty-eight cases and five deaths. A press conference that day stated that 1,185 tests have been conducted thus far. This number is much lower in comparison to India and Pakistan, who as of March 29, have tested 27,688 and 14,336 cases respectively.\n\nImplement awareness campaigns for the general public. Unless an individual is over sixty-five and\/or has pre-existing health conditions, symptoms should be followed by a six to seven-day quarantine period and individuals should not go to health care facilities. If an individual\u2019s health condition continues to deteriorate, they should then go for COVID-19 testing.\n\nEmotional and mental health services, as well as financial support, should be provided for health workers. The medical community of the nation at this point are severely at high risk and are fearful.\n\nSocial\n\nThe Ministry of Religious Affairs should endorse the fatwa of the Council of Senior Scholars at Al-Azhar, one of the Muslim world\u2019s top Islamic institutions, where it is permitted under Sharia Law to suspend congregational prayers to counter the spread of the virus. Many Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East including Saudi Arabia have banned gatherings such as in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nRestaurants and public locations should remain closed after April 4 for a period of at least another ten days, and citizens should be prepared for even longer disruptions of daily life. There must be tougher self-quarantine norms\u2014and if needed lockdown measures\u2014in certain areas of the country with higher concentrations of Bangladeshi expatriates. Sri Lanka had instituted a stay-at-home curfew in eight districts of the country, where violation of this measure has led to the arrest of over 1,600 people. Now that the army has been summoned in Bangladesh, certain districts across the country can be asked to impose curfew-like restrictions, with violations leading to strict punishment and fines.\n\nThe government must utilize television, radio, and social media to counter the spread of fraudulent treatment methods through disinformation channels, and to raise appropriate awareness of COVID-19\u2019s dangers for even otherwise healthy victims.\n\nVillage community leaders such as Imams and village elders should be involved in spreading information on countering COVID-19. Local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and government officials have a list of such leaders and can centrally coordinate their response.\n\nPrivate universities should be mobilized to provide premises for quarantine facilities and temporary hospitals, given that many of them have campuses located right outside Dhaka. Similar initiatives have been taken by higher educational institutions in the United States.\n\nEconomic\n\nTo protect daily wage laborers who have not left Dhaka to return to their hometowns, tougher lockdown measures accompanied by supportive humanitarian measures should be implemented in slum areas where daily wage workers are concentrated. As in the Rohingya camps, daily wage laborers should be provided with rations for two weeks so that they can observe social distancing measures without risk of starvation or malnutrition. Such a policy could build on the precedent by the neighboring Indian state of West Bengal, which will provide free rations to the poor until September. Additionally, as the month of Ramadan is approaching, zakat funds should be collected by both the government and NGOs for this purpose\n\nThe government must provide the necessary financing to allow Gonoshasthaya Kendra and other health care organizations to produce their COVID-19 testing kits at requisite volumes and support distributional channels to allow medical facilities around the country to access these kits.\n\nThe government must help catalyze the funding required to enable the local production of hand sanitizers and PPEs, which are being made by university students and small tech companies. This will disincentivize counterfeiting and fraud.\n\nOver the next six months, the government must ensure that strategies suggested by the ADB and other international organizations are implemented without delay to minimize the inevitable economic slowdown that will follow even a successful fight against the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a once-in-a-generation pathogen that has proven capable of bringing the health systems of the richest countries of the world to their knees. The damage that will be wrought on developing country populations if their governments delay implementation of aggressive countermeasures is unimaginable. Living in densely populated areas with large sections of society reliant on daily wages to make ends meet\u2014and served by public health systems that have been deprived of investment for decades\u2014Bangladeshi citizens are among the world\u2019s most vulnerable to the unchecked spread of this disease. But the situation is not hopeless, and Dhaka must utilize every tool in its arsenal to serve its citizens. The policy checklist presented above is a good place to start.\n\nDr Irfan Nooruddin, Ph.D., is the director of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council and professor in the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University.\n\nDr Rudabeh Shahid, Ph.D., is a nonresident senior fellow of the South Asia Center at the Atlantic Council and a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of York.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nEvent:","tests":"['1,185 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['15,000 surgical masks']"}

Is the country ready?","text":"The new coronavirus is finally slamming Russia. Is the country ready?\n\nFor weeks, Russia seemed to have dodged a bullet. As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) raged just across the border in China, Russia was virtually untouched, reporting just seven confirmed infections as recently as 10 March. Since then, the number has risen fast: Russia has now reported 840 infections, about two-thirds of them in the Moscow region.\n\nSome health care providers have questioned whether Russia truly kept the novel coronavirus at bay. Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of Russia\u2019s Alliance of Doctors trade union, has pointed out that pneumonia cases in Moscow spiked in January\u2014they were 37% higher than in January 2019, according to Rosstat, Russia\u2019s statistics agency. She asserts that COVID-19 must have accounted for at least part of the increase. Others attribute the increase to a greater number of pneumonia patients, anxious about the new coronavirus, seeking treatment.\n\nWith COVID-19 cases now indisputably on the rise in Russia, authorities are moving fast to ramp up detection and hospital bed capacity. Russia\u2019s federal coronavirus coordination council says 193,000 tests based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been done to date. Swabs initially had to be shipped to Siberia for analysis at the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR. Russia\u2019s Federal Service for the Oversight of Consumer Protection and Welfare (Rospotrebnadzor)\u2014the country\u2019s analog of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2014has just expanded testing to its regional laboratories and the Anti-Plague Research Institute.\n\nThe agency says it has created a reserve of 700,000 test kits that it will regularly replenish. And the coronavirus council announced yesterday it is allotting 1.4 billion rubles ($17.7 million) to VECTOR, the antiplague facility, and several Rospotrebnadzor labs to spur vaccine and drug development.\n\nTo cope with a rising tide of patients, Russia\u2019s federal government is building a new hospital on Moscow\u2019s outskirts. Authorities have called on Moscow residents over age 65 to self-isolate at home\u2014an admonishment that Russian President Vladimir Putin, 67, exempted himself from. But Putin on 24 March donned protective gear while visiting a hospital treating COVID-19 patients, and yesterday he ordered all nonessential workplaces to close from 28 March to 5 April, declaring that \u201cthe safest thing is to be at home now.\u201d Today, the government suspended international travel into and out of Russia\u2014starting tomorrow\u2014except for charter flights for bringing expatriates home.\n\nAs Russia contends with the mounting COVID-19 threat, Science caught up with Sergey Alkhovsky, a virologist who studies emerging and zoonotic viral infections at the Russian Ministry of Health\u2019s D.I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.\n\nQ: How do you explain the success of Russia\u2019s containment efforts while cases in China were skyrocketing starting in late January?\n\nA: The border with China was closed at the end of January. The border is long, but in total there are only 16 [legal] crossings. All of them were closed, and only one still worked for evacuation of Russians from China. The railway from China was stopped, and all charter flights were canceled. Only a few airlines remained in operation, arriving at one terminal in Moscow with medical supervision of all arrivals and recording of their residence and contacts. By the way, the first two cases in Russia were found on 31 January in two Chinese tourists.\n\nQ: Yet infectious disease wards in the Moscow region are already reaching capacity.\n\nA: Sick people who had contact with foreigners have been isolated in hospitals starting in early February. So, starting last month, hospitals were full of suspected patients, and their relatives were warned about the danger of infection. [Russia\u2019s coronavirus commission yesterday said 112,000 people are in self-isolation in their homes.]\n\nQ: Where are all these patients coming from?\n\nA: There is some community transmission, but the majority of patients who tested positive arrived from Europe. Unfortunately, measures to restrict air travel with Europe were introduced too late, when outbreaks had already occurred in Italy and other countries. [The first genome of the novel coronavirus sequenced from a Russian patient\u2014a woman in St. Petersburg\u2014placed it in a clade circulating in Europe.]\n\nQ: Initially, Russia allowed work on the novel coronavirus in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) labs. Last week, it relaxed the regulation to allow research in BSL-2 facilities. Why the change?\n\nA: It had become clear that the virus is not so dangerous.\n\nQ: What do you mean?\n\nA: The initial decision of the authorities was to allow work with the virus only at VECTOR. This decision seemed excessive, as it meant many research groups could not get the virus for development and testing of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Now we know more about the virus and these strict requirements are canceled. This will allow for PCR testing in more BSL-2 laboratories and will allow scientists from other institutions to get involved in the work on the virus.\n\nQ: In vaccine and drug R&D?\n\nA: Russia has developed vaccines against tick-borne encephalitis, polio, smallpox, influenza, and other infections. Groups from scientific institutions at Rospotrebnadzor, the Ministry of Health, and the Federal Biomedical Agency have declared they will conduct early vaccine trials in the near future. Within several months, we expect to have two to three vaccine options. But the development of anticoronavirus drugs is still at the very initial stages.","tests":"['700,000 test kits', '193,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, started an oil price war with Saudi Arabia, the global economy be damned.\n\nHowever, in less than 48 hours, that image has begun to crumble as the Russian government has kicked its response to COVID-19 into overdrive: shutting down its borders, limiting air travel, closing schools, and launching a large economic stimulus as medical experts have begun to question Russia\u2019s official coronavirus statistics and the true efficacy of the response to limit its spread.\n\nShould the true scope of the virus prove to be higher than shown in official statistics, it would mean that the Russian government has missed its chance to slow the pandemic, leaving an already overstretched health care system and weakened economy to deal with the burden of a new national crisis.\n\n\u201cBecause the government now understands that infections could jump rapidly, we see new measures being employed to try and contain things very quickly,\u201d said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cThe key concern is that the medical system doesn\u2019t have the capacity to deal with the coming uptick in cases.\u201d\n\n[Mapping the Coronavirus Outbreak: Get daily updates on the pandemic and learn how it\u2019s affecting countries around the world.]\n\nOn Tuesday, Putin toured a new coronavirus information center in Moscow that is pulling together high-tech resources, including surveillance cameras and artificial intelligence, to monitor social media for disinformation about the spread of the disease, properly enforce quarantines, and identify empty supermarket shelves, which have recently been emptied in major cities as Russians have begun stockpiling goods. After the visit, Putin said that he judged the situation in the country to be \u201cunder control.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were able to contain the mass penetration and spread\u201d of the pandemic, Putin said during a government meeting of ministers and top officials in Moscow. \u201cThe situation is generally under control despite high risk levels.\u201d\n\nIn spite of such public assurances, Russia has stepped up its defenses recently. Foreign nationals are now banned from entering until May 1 as part of an effort to slow the spread of the virus, and Moscow has barred all outdoor events and limited indoor gatherings to fewer than 50 people. Older Russians have been told to remain inside. Schools are now closed, as are major tourist attractions, while Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced a $4 billion bailout package on Monday to help businesses that are at risk due to the drop-off in economic activity. Russia has also shut its sizable land borders with its 14 neighbors, and the city of Moscow is currently constructing two large hospitals to house patients infected with the coronavirus.\n\nThe recent speed of the government response may in part be due to recognition that the virus is, in fact, spreading throughout the country. While official figures remain low, evidence is emerging that that reality is more severe, with many cases of the virus being misdiagnosed as other ailments. A report published last week by RBC, a Russian business newspaper, found that Rosstat, the country\u2019s official statistics agency, has recorded an increase of 37 percent of cases of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia\u201d in January as compared to January 2019, which could fit similar symptoms to the coronavirus. Such an increase would represent nearly 2,000 cases.\n\nOther evidence that a much larger spread of the virus could be hiding in Russia was put forward by the Doctor\u2019s Alliance, a recently formed countrywide union for medical professionals, who said that the true figure of those infected with the new coronavirus could be in the thousands, but that many cases have likely been labelled as pneumonia. In a recent video posted on the group\u2019s YouTube channel, the organization also warned about a lack of protective gear in hospitals outside of major cities in Russia\u2019s regions that could lead to more infections. The video also featured anonymous calls from doctors who said that they were being told to clear entire hospital wards in order to accommodate a flood of patients suffering from \u201cpneumonia.\u201d\n\nA report by the Russian outlet Meduza also pointed to a similar development in St. Petersburg, which has recorded 10 confirmed cases of coronavirus, but where local hospitals have run out of space due to an influx of influenza and pneumonia patients.\n\nListen Now: Don't Touch Your Face A new podcast from Foreign Policy covering all aspects of the coronavirus pandemic Learn More\n\nThe small official figures for coronavirus cases and the more muted government response in Russia compared to its peers around the world stem from a combination of economic, political, and practical realities inside the country.\n\nCoronavirus testing in Russia is currently a monopoly run by a lab in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, more than 2,000 miles east of Moscow, where the testing procedure is overseen by Rospotrebnadzor, the state health watchdog. This means that the lab faces a thickening bottleneck and growing backlog in terms of delivering results. Moreover, tests in Russia are conducted via a locally developed version, which some medical experts have said may not be accurate enough to identify all cases of the virus. On top of that, a longstanding lack of trust in the medical system may be preventing some sick patients from coming forward for testing.\n\n\u201cPeople won\u2019t go see a doctor, because many are accustomed to home remedies, and there is a deep distrust in the health system, especially outside of Moscow,\u201d said Judy Twigg, an expert on public health in Russia at Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nThe Russian government has also been somewhat resistant to sound the alarm about the virus due to the country\u2019s struggling economy, which has been hit by twin shocks of a global downturn caused by the spread of the coronavirus and an ongoing oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Until just a few weeks ago, Putin was promising Russians that their stagnant incomes would finally pick up along with the economy this year, but recent developments have dashed those hopes, and limiting their impact appears to be a top priority for the Kremlin.\n\n\u201cThe government knows that people don\u2019t have much savings and that businesses run on monthly cash flow,\u201d said Gabuev from the Carnegie Moscow Center. \u201cThe concern is how to do a proper quarantine and not cause a massive economic disruption in the process.\u201d\n\nIn terms of managing the virus, the Russian government responded quickly at the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020 by shutting down its 2,600-mile border with China and limiting flights between the two countries. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin, who was recently appointed by Putin to head a coronavirus task force, also enacted a series of controversial policies targeting the Chinese community, such as raids on work sites with Chinese laborers and asking city bus drivers to report when Chinese-looking passengers got on board. The measures earned a rare rebuke from the Chinese Embassy in Moscow, which complained directly to the Kremlin. According to official numbers, the tough border measures appear to have worked, with the majority of confirmed cases in Russia coming from citizens who were abroad in Europe, particularly in Italy.\n\nSince then, the Russian capital has remained on \u201chigh-alert,\u201d with strict policies implemented, but Moscow has so far refrained from calling for a national emergency, as has been done across Europe. The city has said that anyone ignoring quarantine requirements could face up to five years in prison, and the authorities have used Moscow\u2019s widespread facial-recognition network to monitor people under quarantine, even issuing fines when some have gone outside to drop off the trash.\n\nBut while Russia has taken tough new measures this week to slow the spread of the virus, restaurants, bars, and shopping malls currently remain open. Similarly, while many businesses have already told employees to work from home, Sobyanin only issued an official decree on Wednesday for Moscow employees to work from home.\n\n\u201cThe longer you keep things open and hold back on the social distancing side of things for fear of the economic situation, the more you are delaying an inevitable spike in the spread of the virus,\u201d Twigg said.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia\u2019s political life continues to move forward even while the pandemic is hitting closer to home. Despite concerns about large crowds of people gathering, Putin confirmed on Tuesday a planned nationwide vote on April 22 on constitutional amendments that would allow him to run for two more terms as president.\n\nSimilarly, the Kremlin said that it would continue with rehearsals for its Victory Day parade in May, which will mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union\u2019s defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II and could involve up to 10,000 soldiers training together.","tests":"['116,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

One way to move toward an answer is to compare conditions in Russia to those in Italy. Local doctors working in the hard-hit Lombardy region have repeatedly pointed to a shortage of ventilators, devices that can be necessary to keep patients breathing in severe cases. Data collected by Meduza indicates that Russia\u2019s supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries. That said, ventilators alone are not enough to overcome the pandemic. In a number of other areas, comparing Russian and Italian health infrastructure doesn\u2019t bode well at all for Russia.\n\nItaly is among the countries hardest hit by the novel coronavirus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 19, there were almost 36,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy, and 2,978 of those individuals had died, meaning that the virus is spreading faster in Italy than in any other country. Every day, hundreds of new cases and deaths are recorded despite a March 10 nationwide quarantine order.\n\nNorthern Italy is engaged in an especially vicious struggle against the virus. The country\u2019s COVID-19 outbreak began in Lombardy, which remains the epicenter of Italy\u2019s pandemic. Even in the wealthiest areas of one of the most highly developed countries in the European Union, healthcare systems are buckling under the weight of a crisis for which they were catastrophically unprepared. In one viral Facebook post, surgeon Daniele Macchini of Bergamo compared the working conditions in his hospital to the effects of a war or the aftermath of a tsunami. The number of patients infected is rising geometrically, more and more doctors and nurses are contracting the virus themselves, and every ventilator is worth its weight in gold.\n\nWhy are artificial breathing aids necessary, and how extreme do they get?\n\nBetween 20 and 30 percent of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized require intensive care. Among those patients, 47 to 71 percent require artificial lung ventilation in order for their bodies to absorb enough oxygen. That number is equivalent to between two and four percent of all infected patients.\n\nIn especially severe cases, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) may be used. This complex procedure involves redirecting the patient\u2019s blood through a device outside the body that adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, fulfilling the key functions of breathing without relying on the patient\u2019s lungs. ECMO may be called for in 0.1 \u2013 0.3 percent of COVID-19 cases, but its effectiveness in the pandemic is still in doubt. The procedure carries an increased risk of blood clots and infections, and ventilators may be even more effective if used with additional steps. For example, patients who do not regain enough oxygen may be turned onto their stomachs during ventilation to increase the space available to their lungs, and doctors can artificially shut down muscle activity to decrease the patient\u2019s oxygen needs and their body\u2019s resistance to the ventilation process.\n\nGiven the risks involved, ECMO devices are rarely used, including in Russia. For example, the Yudin City Clinical Hospital, which has the largest number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds of any Moscow institution \u2014 144 of them, to be exact \u2014 has used ECMO only five times within the last year. The necessary equipment is expensive, and using it requires highly specific skills. The WHO has recommended using ECMO in COVID-19 cases only if an experienced specialist is available.\n\nHow many ventilators and ECMO machines are there in Russia?\n\nMeduza collected data from open sources to find out how many ventilators and ECMO devices government hospitals have on hand in most of Russia\u2019s regions as well as Crimea. We also compared those numbers to the population of each region. The results are in the table below; regions are ranked by number of ventilators per capita. While we have included the relevant statistics for Italy, the U.S., the U.K., and Ukraine as benchmarks, there may be differences in exactly how those data were collected from country to country. For example, while the figures for Russia only account for public institutions, the U.K. data cover private and military ones as well.\n\nREGION VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS NUMBER OF VENTILATORS ECMO MACHINES PER 100,000 RESIDENTS NUMBER OF ECMO MACHINES Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (Yugra) 56.8 951 0.18 3 Samara region 42.6 1,353 0.03 1 Amur region 42.5 336 no data Moscow (city) 40 5,077 0.23 29 Kirov region 39.6 500 0.08 1 Arkhangelsk region 38.4 419 0.18 2 Sakha Republic (Yakutia) 37.2 361 no data Sakhalin region 37.1 181 0 0 Tomsk region 37.1 400 0.37 4 St. Petersburg (city) 35.2 1,898 0.46 25 Lipetsk region 35.1 400 no data Sverdlovsk region 35 1,510 0.05 2 Chuvash Republic (Chuvashia) 34.7 422 0.08 1 Altai Krai 34.6 802 0.04 1 Republic of Crimea (status disputed) 34.3 656 no data Republic of Karelia 32.5 200 0.16 1 Yaroslavl region 31.5 395 no data Vladimir region 31.4 426 0.07 1 Tambov region 31.2 314 no data Penza region 30.7 400 0.08 1 Murmansk region 30.5 226 0.27 2 Pskov region 30.3 190 0.16 1 Republic of Tatarstan 28.2 1,100 no data Orenburg region 27.7 542 0.05 1 Russia 27.3 40,000 0.1 124 Kemerovo region 27.3 726 0.08 2 Ryazan region 27.1 300 no data Irkutsk region 26.5 633 no data Republic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria) 25.5 1,031 no data Republic of Buryatia 24.9 246 0.1 1 Krasnoyarsk Krai 24.6 705 0.03 1 Chelyabinsk region 24.5 849 0.06 2 Astrakhan region 23.9 240 0.3 3 Zabaikalsky Krai 22.8 242 no data Saratov region 22.1 536 no data Vologda region 22.1 257 no data Kursk region 21.9 242 0.09 1 Orlov region 21.8 160 no data Mari El Republic 20.9 124 0 0 Novosibirsk region 20.4 570 0.18 5 Tula region 20.3 297 no data Udmurt Republic (Udmurtia) 20.2 303 no data Perm Krai 20 520 0.04 1 Kostroma region 19.1 121 no data United States 18.8 68,000 no data Kaliningrad region 18.8 190 0.2 2 Omsk region 18.7 361 no data Ivanovo region 17.9 178 no data Krasnodar Krai 17.6 1,000 0.07 4 Belgorod region 16.8 260 no data Rostov region 15.3 643 0.05 2 Voronezh region 15 348 no data Leningrad region 14.3 268 no data United Kingdom 12.9 8,175 no data Sevastopol (city; status disputed) 12.9 58 0.22 1 Tver region 9.4 118 0 0 Ukraine 8.6 3,600 0.08 15 Italy 8.3 5,000 no data Kaluga region 4.8 48 0.1 1 Bryansk region no data 0.08 1 Moscow region no data 0.01 1 Smolensk region no data 0.11 1 Nizhny Novgorod region no data 0.03 1 Republic of Mordovia no data 0.13 1 Komi Republic no data 0.12 1 Khabarovsk Krai no data 0.08 1 Source: Data from regional healthcare agencies\n\nThese data paint a relatively optimistic picture for Russia: The country significantly surpasses Western countries in terms of ventilator availability. For example, on average, there are 27.3 ventilators in Russia for every 100,000 people, while in the U.S., according to official data from Johns Hopkins University, ICUs have a total of 62,000 ventilators. That makes for only 18.8 ventilators per 100,000 people. In Russian state hospitals, there are 40,000 ventilators, and hospitals are also purchasing new ones as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Italy\u2019s national emergencies ministry (known as the Protezione Civile), there are about 5,000 ventilators for the entire country. That makes for 8.3 ventilators per 100,000 residents \u2014 less than half of the same figure for Russia\u2019s Ivanovo region, which has about the same population density as Kentucky. Italy has made an urgent attempt to buy enough ventilators to double the national supply, but medical equipment manufacturers worldwide are already struggling to keep up with the flood of orders triggered by the pandemic, according to Reuters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where doctors from the National Health Service (NHS) are also warning that the country is catastrophically unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, Parliament\u2019s Health and Social Care Committee has counted a total of 8,175 ventilators throughout the country, including those intended for children and those located in private clinics and military storage. That\u2019s only 12.9 machines for every 100,000 people, which is also less than almost any region in Russia.\n\n\u201cMoscow is completely equipped with the necessary equipment. There are approximately 5,000 ventilation apparatuses accounted for in the city at this time. 265 additional machines are on reserve for potential coronavirus patients,\u201d Moscow\u2019s Healthcare Department told Meduza. It is nonetheless worth noting that not all of those ventilators are available for immediate use at any given time: Other patients who can\u2019t breathe on their own may be connected to them already.\n\nOn top of its 40,000 state-owned ventilators, Russia can also draw on the resources of its private clinics, which could be mobilized to respond to a sudden spike in cases. There is also a private rental market for ventilators in Russia. It is currently used primarily by relatives of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients for in-home care, but some of its devices could be redirected to hospitals. This does not mean that Russians will be able to count on using their very own ventilator by any means. While \u201cventilators\u201d are sold freely in the country, and they can cost anywhere from 100,000 rubles ($1,252) for mobile versions intended to work only part of the day up to several million rubles for full-fledged machines, only specially trained professionals can use these devices. Without a specialist nearby, rental ventilators will be useless.\n\nCurrently, at least according to official case counts, Russia is \u201cbehind\u201d many other countries in the typical timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 20, 2020, the country\u2019s national consumer welfare agency Rospotrebnadzor had reported 253 confirmed infections. The first confirmed death of a coronavirus patient in Russia occurred on March 19 in Moscow\u2019s Infectious Disease Hospital No. 2. The patient was 79 years old and chronically ill; her cause of death was recorded as \u201ca bursting blood clot, not pneumonia,\u201d said Moscow\u2019s chief pathologist, Oleg Zairatyants.\n\nMost Russians who have been infected with the novel coronavirus are currently being treated at Moscow\u2019s City Clinical Hospital No. 40. On the morning of March 20, the hospital\u2019s lead doctor, Denis Protsenko, wrote on Facebook that none of those COVID-19 patients has yet required artificial lung ventilation.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that bad? Russians have reliable protection from the pandemic?\n\nAn abundance of ventilators actually may not be a decisive advantage in this crisis. Vladimir Budyansky, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician who moderates the 14,400-member Facebook group \u201cMedical Emergencies,\u201d told Meduza that there are various kinds of ventilators. Some are advanced devices produced in the West that can provide 24-hour ventilation for patients experiencing health crises of various levels. Others are \u201cold-fashioned,\u201d in his words, and can\u2019t be used for contemporary lung ventilation procedures at all.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, artificial lung ventilation is quite a fine-tuned, complicated process,\u201d Budyansky said. \u201cIt requires a lot of other things [aside from the ventilator itself]. There are anesthetic devices that still allow for ventilation, but those are supposed to be for operations, and they don\u2019t have a range of settings. Using a ventilator with a patient in the ICU or the emergency room is something of a different, more complex task that can take five to 10 days, sometimes months \u2014 not several hours, which is what it can take on the operating table,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are mobile \u2018ventilators\u2019 that are housed in ambulances \u2014 those are meant to ventilate patients for anywhere from one to 12 hours. In short, this isn\u2019t a single kind of device; it\u2019s a spectrum of various different devices. It\u2019s like with cars: Some are for driving off-road, and some are for driving in cities.\u201d\n\nAside from the question of whether the ventilators available actually fit patients\u2019 needs, there\u2019s the fact that if a patient has to be on a ventilator, they\u2019re already in critical condition. That means they need a whole set of critical care procedures, specialized equipment, and medical professionals who can use that equipment and put those measures in place. In Budyansky\u2019s opinion, this is where Russian medicine loses out to Italy.\n\n\u201cThe Italian healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world in all the rankings that are out there. It\u2019s always been in the top five. I\u2019ve seen their level of training myself. All else held equal, we\u2019ll have a relatively spotty situation with treating critically ill patients in some regions of the country,\u201d the doctor explained. \u201cTheir problem wasn\u2019t so much with the ventilators as it was with beds, with the fact that they had to turn operating rooms into intensive care units on the fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s say we take your average ICU: 20 beds, and each one has one person on artificial ventilation. We have the same equipment they do, there are doctors, there are nurses. I think that in a lot of situations, we\u2019ll have it worse for a variety of reasons. For example, when they say they don\u2019t have enough nurses, for them, that means there used to be one nurse per patient, and now, there\u2019s one for every two. Well, we\u2019ve got one nurse serving three or four or five already. So what\u2019s twice as bad as usual for them is two times better than what we have normally,\u201d Budyansky concluded.\n\nStory by Ivan Golunov, Alexey Kovalev, and Darya Sarkisyan English version by Hilah Kohen","tests":null,"ventilators":"['5,000 ventilators', '8,175 ventilators', '62,000 ventilators', '40,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

But when it does, as many experts soon expect, it could prove a huge challenge to Russian President Vladimir Putin during a fragile time for his rule.\n\nPutin markets himself as Russia\u2019s hero, the only man who can restore the former Soviet Union\u2019s greatness and bring stability to his country. Anything that messes with that image, whether it\u2019s large-scale protests, a prominent opposition leader, or questions about his leadership, ruins the myth he and his allies have cultivated for decades.\n\nA significant Covid-19 outbreak in Russia, and particularly in the densely populated capital of Moscow, would be devastating to the dictator. If tens of thousands get sick and die, it would puncture the narrative armor Putin has around himself. That high death toll is distinctly possible, as medical resources outside Russia\u2019s major cities are scarce and the country\u2019s older population is at high risk.\n\nThe looming crisis couldn\u2019t come at a worse time for Russia. Oil prices, the lifeblood of its economy, have tanked. A transition plan to keep Putin in power until 2036 is delayed. And early data this year shows Russians are contracting \u201cpneumonia\u201d at higher rates than in the past; some critics say that it\u2019s actually Covid-19, and that the government is manipulating statistics to make it seem like the spread isn\u2019t that bad.\n\nPut together, this is a \u201cperfect storm of problems for the Kremlin,\u201d said Alina Polyakova, a Russia expert and president of the Center for European Policy Analysis in Washington.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that despite some early aggressive measures like closing its borders, including the 2,600-mile one with China, experts say the Russian government response was not enough. Doctors have conducted few tests for the virus, blinding authorities to just how widespread the outbreak might be.\n\nConcerns have risen to the point that Moscow\u2019s mayor, a Putin ally, has continuously and openly asserted the situation is surely worse than it appears.\n\nThe stream of bad news had Putin hiding in the shadows, not wanting to take the fall for the deadly mishaps. But now that the number of cases continues to rise \u2014 and quickly \u2014 Putin has visibly taken command of the response. After all, he, more than anyone, is aware of the precarious moment in his leadership.\n\nYet a top Russian doctor who shook hands with Putin during a recent hospital tour tested positive for the coronavirus last week \u2014 underscoring how perilous the situation is.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d Tatiana Stanovaya, a Russia expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center, told me.\n\nAnd there\u2019s a chance Putin can\u2019t withstand it.\n\nRussia is headed for a US-sized crisis\n\nNo one can accuse the Russian government of standing by as the coronavirus swept across the globe.\n\nOn January 30, the government closed its large, far-eastern border with China and suspended the issue of electronic visas to Chinese people. Days later, it evacuated Russians in China on military airplanes and threatened to deport foreigners who tested positive for the disease.\n\nThat same month, passengers flying into Moscow from China, Iran, and South Korea \u2014 the coronavirus epicenters at the time \u2014 had to undergo tests once they stepped off the plane. Meanwhile, citizens returning from Europe would have their temperatures checked and be ordered to quarantine for 14 days at home.\n\nExperts note these measures, while tough, at best limited the number of infected people in the country and perhaps prevented a larger outbreak. On their own, though, they weren\u2019t enough \u2014 and that\u2019s where Russia went wrong.\n\nCovid-19 tests had to be conducted with a locally made device many viewed as faulty. All completed tests had to be sent to a single lab in Siberia for results, causing a massive backlog at the facility. This allowed Russians to continue living their normal lives without knowing if they carried the disease or not, and blinded the Kremlin from tracking the spread.\n\nWeeks went by before Russia took additive measures. It wasn\u2019t until mid-March that Russia chose to close schools and certain businesses, limit air travel, and consider a large economic stimulus package to alleviate financial strain on the people. But by then, it was all but assured that the small number of cases Russia had early on would grow.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Russia responded slowly, said Dr. Vasiliy Vlassov, an epidemiologist at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, it\u2019s that \u201cthe response from the beginning was not adequate.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t gotten much better. Last week, Putin announced a week-long vacation for the entire country, hoping that would compel Russians to stay home and socially distance from one another. Instead, thousands in Moscow and around the nation went outside to enjoy the nice weather and time off. It forced the Kremlin two days later to reiterate that the government wanted everyone to stay inside, not go out for joy rides.\n\nAnd as major regional governments imposed shelter-in-place rules last week, people continued to ignore the orders. even as police drove around to remind everyone to head back inside. That\u2019s a quintessentially Russian trait, according to experts.\n\n\u201cThe people were not forced from the beginning\u201d to stay inside, Vlassov told me. \u201cThat\u2019s because they actually adapted to be forced from the Soviet time. If no one is forced, then it can\u2019t be that serious.\u201d\n\nTrying to make people take the orders more seriously, the Kremlin passed a measure that could see those found violating the lockdown measures imprisoned for up to seven years.\n\nMore video footage of the strict Moscow region curfew from 8pm-8am being enforced by police cars with loudspeakers and adhered to. pic.twitter.com\/z3XqYOGh6g \u2014 Jason Corcoran (@jason_corcoran) March 29, 2020\n\nThose heavy-handed measures may do some good, experts say, but it probably still isn\u2019t enough. \u201cIt\u2019s my fear that it\u2019s too little, too late,\u201d Judy Twigg, an expert on health care in Russia at Virginia Commonwealth University, told me.\n\nWhat comes next could be catastrophic.\n\nRussia is \u201cprobably in the early stage of the same epidemic which is going on in the United States now,\u201d Michael Favorov, who led the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Eastern European and Central Asian programs, told me. \u201cThey are facing significant increases of cases within the next month\u201d in the capital and beyond, \u201cand a significant increase in the number of deaths.\u201d\n\nThe question, then, is why Putin and his allies failed to impose all necessary measures early on when they likely could have done the most good. The answer is that Putin prioritized politics over public health.\n\nPutin\u2019s precarious political position\n\nIn a way, Putin brought this dire predicament upon himself.\n\nBack in January, Russia\u2019s entire government resigned as part of a major constitutional reform to give Putin more power and extend his rule 12 years beyond his current end date in 2024.\n\nAs Vox\u2019s Jen Kirby explained at the time:\n\nPutin\u2019s proposed constitutional reforms broadly seek to limit the power of the presidency and give more responsibilities to the Parliament, including the job of choosing the country\u2019s prime minister. He also intends to give more power to the State Council, an advisory body to the head of state that doesn\u2019t have a ton of authority right now... The problem is that Putin\u2019s constitutional changes intend to limit the power of a president who is not him, thus ensuring his successor is far weaker than he has been.\n\nThe referendum vote to give him that authority \u2014 which he was widely expected win \u2014 was scheduled for April 22. But due to the outbreak, the Russian leader last week postponed the vote, saying medical professionals will tell him when the time is right to schedule it again.\n\n\u201cYou know that this is a very serious matter for me. Of course, I will ask you to go to the polling stations to express your opinion on this issue of fundamental and crucial importance to the country and society,\u201d Putin said in his March 25 address to the nation. \u201cOur absolute priority is the health, life and safety of the people. This is why I believe the vote should be postponed.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Putin doesn\u2019t want to make millions of Russian lives miserable ahead of the vote, or at a minimum give them more reason to question his bid for power. Draconian measures would make it look like his government doesn\u2019t have the situation under control, and the Center for European Analysis\u2019s Polyakova said stability is central to Putin\u2019s pitch.\n\nPolitically speaking, \u201cthis crisis comes at the worst moment for him,\u201d she told me.\n\nHe also made a big miscalculation. In early March, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a cartel of 15 countries of oil-producing nations, met at OPEC\u2019s headquarters in Vienna to discuss what to do as the disease\u2019s impact has lowered global demand for oil.\n\nRussia is not part of the bloc, but Russian officials were invited to the meeting. That\u2019s because three years ago Russia made a deal to coordinate its production levels with the group, in a pact known as OPEC+.\n\nAt the meeting, Saudi Arabia, the cartel\u2019s leader, suggested the participants collectively cut their oil production by about 1 million barrels per day, with Russia making the most dramatic cut of around 500,000 barrels a day.\n\nDoing so would have kept oil prices higher, which would bring in more revenue for nations in the bloc whose economies are heavily dependent on crude exports. Saudi Arabia considered the move necessary because demand from Asia, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus, plummeted.\n\nThe Russians, long wary of such a move, opted against the plan. It\u2019s still unclear exactly why, but some said Putin wanted prices to stay low to hurt the American shale oil industry or was gearing up to seize a bigger sliver of Asian and global oil demand for Russia.\n\nSaudi Arabia didn\u2019t take too kindly to the Kremlin\u2019s decision and responded by slashing its export prices that weekend to start a price war with Russia. That brought the price per barrel down by about $11 to $35 a barrel \u2014 the biggest one-day drop since 1991.\n\nAs of April 6, oil stands around $30 a barrel, and that\u2019s disastrous from Russia\u2019s point of view. The country heavily depends on oil revenues to fill the government\u2019s coffers. Without a large, reliable amount of money coming in, Putin will have fewer funds to spend on his nation, let alone deal with a growing health crisis at home.\n\nFor Putin to mess with the oil market as Covid-19 cases grew around the world, Polyakova says, shows he sometimes lets short-term thinking drive his long-lasting, impactful decision-making.\n\nAnd now that the coronavirus crisis is growing in Russia, Putin will surely wish he could take that blunder back.\n\nRussia\u2019s health care system is fairly well prepared, but the coronavirus will likely overwhelm it\n\nFavorov, the former CDC official, told me that the current Russian health care system was built in the Soviet era, with its focus primarily on preventing large-scale disasters. In 1919, for example, Vladimir Lenin issued a nationwide decree that everyone should get a smallpox vaccination. Those who didn\u2019t follow the order at best were jailed, and at worst killed.\n\nTo this day, a focus on preventing public health crises remains, Favorov said. \u201cThe system is highly sensitive to any diseases which might be a threat to public health.\u201d\n\nDr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization\u2019s representative to Russia, told me the country is fairly well prepared for an outbreak. It has \u201ca massive public health information campaign to raise awareness and preventive measures,\u201d she said, with around 70,000 hospital beds and 40,000 ventilators.\n\nBut, she made sure to note, \u201cit is human behavior that determines the outcome of outbreaks and that is why public health information [is] of highest importance to address any health challenge.\u201d\n\nRussia\u2019s health care system isn\u2019t in poor shape. In fact, Russian propaganda continues to claim that the country is better prepared than the United States for what\u2019s coming, even noting how Putin offered President Donald Trump assistance. In fact, a Russian plane with medical equipment was dispatched to the US already.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Russia can handle a major outbreak better than many nations, if and when it gets really bad, because it has the means. But there are still major problems that will affect care in the country.\n\nVCU\u2019s Twigg said that a lot of the equipment Russian hospitals have, including ventilators, break down with alarming frequency. Russia is having more produced, but it\u2019s unclear if those who need them will have them in time, especially as the rich hoard them. Further, Russia is short of the equipment that goes with ventilators, like oxygen or anesthetic sedatives. And, Twigg says, it\u2019s unclear if the country has enough well-trained 24\/7 intensive care nurses to staff patients on ventilators.\n\nThat\u2019s not all: According to Vlassov, the epidemiologist in Moscow, Russia increased salaries for physicians in recent years. While that helped attract top talent, it lowered the amount of funds available to buy top-of-the-line materials for medical care. What\u2019s more, the government\u2019s focus in spending more on the health care sector was on building new hospitals, not investing in protective equipment for doctors.\n\nBeyond that, the system may have failed in a greater sense.\n\nAccording to the Russian government\u2019s own official statistics, Moscow saw 6,921 pneumonia cases in January, compared to 5,058 during the same period the year before. That\u2019s a 37 percent increase, and those figures come from physicians who report them to the government.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Russia had a spike of pneumonia cases, experts tell me, and some pneumonia cases have gone undiagnosed as Covid-19 cases in other countries. Some, though, have alleged that the statistics may have been manipulated to make it seem like the outbreak wasn\u2019t so bad.\n\n\u201cWhile the whole world is facing an outbreak of a new coronavirus, Russia is facing an outbreak of a community-acquired pneumonia. And as usual, we\u2019re facing the lie of the authorities,\u201d Anastasia Vasilyeva, president of the Doctors\u2019 Alliance trade union and an ally of a top Putin opponent, said in a YouTube video last month. She was detained on April 3 by Russian authorities.\n\nIt may sound like a conspiracy theory, but there\u2019s precedent for this view. In 2015, Putin said he wanted to lower the death rate caused by cardiovascular disease in Russia. Almost immediately, hospitals began to report that fewer people were dying from heart conditions. What made that more suspicious is that there was a rise \u2014 at about the same rate \u2014 of deaths from other causes.\n\nThe only thing that could assure Russia can deal with what\u2019s coming, then, is massive interest and involvement from Putin. Despite many earlier stumbles, he may have just started to take the crisis very seriously.\n\nCan Putin be Russia\u2019s coronavirus hero?\n\nPutin doesn\u2019t like to be the bearer of bad news. When things look to be headed the wrong way, he usually asks a loyalist to be the face of the government response in case it fails.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a big joke in Russia that the person who gets the finance portfolio will be the person everyone\u2019s going to hate,\u201d CEPA\u2019s Polyakova told me, chuckling.\n\nPutin followed that playbook with Russia\u2019s initial response to the coronavirus. He had a loyalist, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, take charge, allowing Putin to remain in the shadows. The appointment had a veneer of legitimacy, as Moscow was the epicenter of the country\u2019s outbreak, but experts agree Putin aimed to distance himself from the situation.\n\nThat position soon became untenable, especially once Sobyanin continued to make clear that the problem likely was worse than it seemed. \u201cNobody knows the real picture,\u201d the mayor openly told Putin last week, alluding to the lack of widespread testing. \u201cIn reality, there are far more people who are infected.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s why few are surprised that Putin has become a much more visible figure in recent days. He was seen sporting a yellow hazmat suit while visiting a coronavirus hospital in Moscow. Incidentally, the top doctor at that hospital who was pictured shaking hands with Putin tested positive this week for Covid-19, causing Putin to work remotely for the time being.\n\nAnd in a recent videoconference with government members, Putin told them to start getting serious and tell him truthful information when he needs it. \u201cThe results of our work should correspond to what is happening at present,\u201d he said. That, for VCU\u2019s Twigg, was surprising. \u201cIt was an implicit admission that what\u2019s been going on until now was everybody lying to each other,\u201d she told me.\n\nPutin, then, is on the case \u2014 but he still faces serious hurdles to get the response right.\n\nThe most important will be quashing the expected major outbreak in Moscow. Many experts told me the disease spread there could end up being worse than the one in New York City, partly because of how densely populated the Russian capital is. That\u2019d be extremely damaging for Putin: If he can\u2019t keep people in the showpiece capital safe, it would hurt his image as the country\u2019s protector.\n\nThat has many worried Putin will zero in on Moscow at the expense of other parts of the country.\n\nIt could pose serious problems, as the many Russians who defied orders to stay inside may have traveled to nearby vacation spots of their hometowns. If they brought the disease with them, an outbreak could pop up across the country\u2019s 11 time zones while Putin solely tackles the Moscow challenge. Russia is already using surveillance tools on phones to track people during the outbreak.\n\nHospitals outside the major cities aren\u2019t well-equipped, experts told me, with some estimates saying they\u2019ve cumulatively lost about 50 percent of their capacity over the last decade. If they\u2019re outside Putin\u2019s interests, they will struggle to care for patients.\n\n\u201cFor big cities, the situation may be rather manageable,\u201d Carnegie\u2019s Stanovaya told me, \u201cbut in the countryside, it will be difficult.\u201d\n\nBut another problem arises if the Moscow outbreak gets significantly worse. If the number of positive cases and deaths tick upward, there will be immense pressure on Putin to take drastic measures to stop the spread. That could mean sending out law enforcement on the streets, experts say, forcing people inside. It\u2019d be a very visible symbol of just how out of control the situation had become.\n\nVlassov, the epidemiologist in Moscow, relayed a broader worry he has. Every apartment building in the capital has an electronic system to get inside, as well as cameras at the entrance. If the Kremlin decides the people can\u2019t be trusted to stay in their homes, he says many in the city fear the government will lock the doors on the millions of inhabitants. After all, those locks are part of a city-wide, state-approved system.\n\n\u201cPeople discuss it in the context of an epidemic, but also in the context of a public uprising against the government,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Putin plans to do next, or if his newfound vigor in dealing with the health crisis will keep Russia from ruin. Most agree, though, that Putin will take whatever steps he must to ensure the crisis doesn\u2019t bring his country to a breaking point.\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the magnitude of the outbreak,\u201d said Favorov, the former CDC official. But, he added, as soon as the Kremlin needs to ramp up its efforts, \u201cthey will do it in the old Soviet style.\u201d","tests":"['19 tests']","ventilators":"['40,000 ventilators']","beds":"['70,000 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

One way to move toward an answer is to compare conditions in Russia to those in Italy. Local doctors working in the hard-hit Lombardy region have repeatedly pointed to a shortage of ventilators, devices that can be necessary to keep patients breathing in severe cases. Data collected by Meduza indicates that Russia\u2019s supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries. That said, ventilators alone are not enough to overcome the pandemic. In a number of other areas, comparing Russian and Italian health infrastructure doesn\u2019t bode well at all for Russia.\n\nItaly is among the countries hardest hit by the novel coronavirus. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of March 19, there were almost 36,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy, and 2,978 of those individuals had died, meaning that the virus is spreading faster in Italy than in any other country. Every day, hundreds of new cases and deaths are recorded despite a March 10 nationwide quarantine order.\n\nNorthern Italy is engaged in an especially vicious struggle against the virus. The country\u2019s COVID-19 outbreak began in Lombardy, which remains the epicenter of Italy\u2019s pandemic. Even in the wealthiest areas of one of the most highly developed countries in the European Union, healthcare systems are buckling under the weight of a crisis for which they were catastrophically unprepared. In one viral Facebook post, surgeon Daniele Macchini of Bergamo compared the working conditions in his hospital to the effects of a war or the aftermath of a tsunami. The number of patients infected is rising geometrically, more and more doctors and nurses are contracting the virus themselves, and every ventilator is worth its weight in gold.\n\nWhy are artificial breathing aids necessary, and how extreme do they get?\n\nBetween 20 and 30 percent of COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized require intensive care. Among those patients, 47 to 71 percent require artificial lung ventilation in order for their bodies to absorb enough oxygen. That number is equivalent to between two and four percent of all infected patients.\n\nIn especially severe cases, Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) may be used. This complex procedure involves redirecting the patient\u2019s blood through a device outside the body that adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, fulfilling the key functions of breathing without relying on the patient\u2019s lungs. ECMO may be called for in 0.1 \u2013 0.3 percent of COVID-19 cases, but its effectiveness in the pandemic is still in doubt. The procedure carries an increased risk of blood clots and infections, and ventilators may be even more effective if used with additional steps. For example, patients who do not regain enough oxygen may be turned onto their stomachs during ventilation to increase the space available to their lungs, and doctors can artificially shut down muscle activity to decrease the patient\u2019s oxygen needs and their body\u2019s resistance to the ventilation process.\n\nGiven the risks involved, ECMO devices are rarely used, including in Russia. For example, the Yudin City Clinical Hospital, which has the largest number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds of any Moscow institution \u2014 144 of them, to be exact \u2014 has used ECMO only five times within the last year. The necessary equipment is expensive, and using it requires highly specific skills. The WHO has recommended using ECMO in COVID-19 cases only if an experienced specialist is available.\n\nHow many ventilators and ECMO machines are there in Russia?\n\nMeduza collected data from open sources to find out how many ventilators and ECMO devices government hospitals have on hand in most of Russia\u2019s regions as well as Crimea. We also compared those numbers to the population of each region. The results are in the table below; regions are ranked by number of ventilators per capita. While we have included the relevant statistics for Italy, the U.S., the U.K., and Ukraine as benchmarks, there may be differences in exactly how those data were collected from country to country. For example, while the figures for Russia only account for public institutions, the U.K. data cover private and military ones as well.\n\nREGION VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS NUMBER OF VENTILATORS ECMO MACHINES PER 100,000 RESIDENTS NUMBER OF ECMO MACHINES Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug (Yugra) 56.8 951 0.18 3 Samara region 42.6 1,353 0.03 1 Amur region 42.5 336 no data Moscow (city) 40 5,077 0.23 29 Kirov region 39.6 500 0.08 1 Arkhangelsk region 38.4 419 0.18 2 Sakha Republic (Yakutia) 37.2 361 no data Sakhalin region 37.1 181 0 0 Tomsk region 37.1 400 0.37 4 St. Petersburg (city) 35.2 1,898 0.46 25 Lipetsk region 35.1 400 no data Sverdlovsk region 35 1,510 0.05 2 Chuvash Republic (Chuvashia) 34.7 422 0.08 1 Altai Krai 34.6 802 0.04 1 Republic of Crimea (status disputed) 34.3 656 no data Republic of Karelia 32.5 200 0.16 1 Yaroslavl region 31.5 395 no data Vladimir region 31.4 426 0.07 1 Tambov region 31.2 314 no data Penza region 30.7 400 0.08 1 Murmansk region 30.5 226 0.27 2 Pskov region 30.3 190 0.16 1 Republic of Tatarstan 28.2 1,100 no data Orenburg region 27.7 542 0.05 1 Russia 27.3 40,000 0.1 124 Kemerovo region 27.3 726 0.08 2 Ryazan region 27.1 300 no data Irkutsk region 26.5 633 no data Republic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria) 25.5 1,031 no data Republic of Buryatia 24.9 246 0.1 1 Krasnoyarsk Krai 24.6 705 0.03 1 Chelyabinsk region 24.5 849 0.06 2 Astrakhan region 23.9 240 0.3 3 Zabaikalsky Krai 22.8 242 no data Saratov region 22.1 536 no data Vologda region 22.1 257 no data Kursk region 21.9 242 0.09 1 Orlov region 21.8 160 no data Mari El Republic 20.9 124 0 0 Novosibirsk region 20.4 570 0.18 5 Tula region 20.3 297 no data Udmurt Republic (Udmurtia) 20.2 303 no data Perm Krai 20 520 0.04 1 Kostroma region 19.1 121 no data United States 18.8 68,000 no data Kaliningrad region 18.8 190 0.2 2 Omsk region 18.7 361 no data Ivanovo region 17.9 178 no data Krasnodar Krai 17.6 1,000 0.07 4 Belgorod region 16.8 260 no data Rostov region 15.3 643 0.05 2 Voronezh region 15 348 no data Leningrad region 14.3 268 no data United Kingdom 12.9 8,175 no data Sevastopol (city; status disputed) 12.9 58 0.22 1 Tver region 9.4 118 0 0 Ukraine 8.6 3,600 0.08 15 Italy 8.3 5,000 no data Kaluga region 4.8 48 0.1 1 Bryansk region no data 0.08 1 Moscow region no data 0.01 1 Smolensk region no data 0.11 1 Nizhny Novgorod region no data 0.03 1 Republic of Mordovia no data 0.13 1 Komi Republic no data 0.12 1 Khabarovsk Krai no data 0.08 1 Source: Data from regional healthcare agencies\n\nThese data paint a relatively optimistic picture for Russia: The country significantly surpasses Western countries in terms of ventilator availability. For example, on average, there are 27.3 ventilators in Russia for every 100,000 people, while in the U.S., according to official data from Johns Hopkins University, ICUs have a total of 62,000 ventilators. That makes for only 18.8 ventilators per 100,000 people. In Russian state hospitals, there are 40,000 ventilators, and hospitals are also purchasing new ones as the coronavirus pandemic escalates.\n\nMeanwhile, according to Italy\u2019s national emergencies ministry (known as the Protezione Civile), there are about 5,000 ventilators for the entire country. That makes for 8.3 ventilators per 100,000 residents \u2014 less than half of the same figure for Russia\u2019s Ivanovo region, which has about the same population density as Kentucky. Italy has made an urgent attempt to buy enough ventilators to double the national supply, but medical equipment manufacturers worldwide are already struggling to keep up with the flood of orders triggered by the pandemic, according to Reuters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, where doctors from the National Health Service (NHS) are also warning that the country is catastrophically unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, Parliament\u2019s Health and Social Care Committee has counted a total of 8,175 ventilators throughout the country, including those intended for children and those located in private clinics and military storage. That\u2019s only 12.9 machines for every 100,000 people, which is also less than almost any region in Russia.\n\n\u201cMoscow is completely equipped with the necessary equipment. There are approximately 5,000 ventilation apparatuses accounted for in the city at this time. 265 additional machines are on reserve for potential coronavirus patients,\u201d Moscow\u2019s Healthcare Department told Meduza. It is nonetheless worth noting that not all of those ventilators are available for immediate use at any given time: Other patients who can\u2019t breathe on their own may be connected to them already.\n\nOn top of its 40,000 state-owned ventilators, Russia can also draw on the resources of its private clinics, which could be mobilized to respond to a sudden spike in cases. There is also a private rental market for ventilators in Russia. It is currently used primarily by relatives of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients for in-home care, but some of its devices could be redirected to hospitals. This does not mean that Russians will be able to count on using their very own ventilator by any means. While \u201cventilators\u201d are sold freely in the country, and they can cost anywhere from 100,000 rubles ($1,252) for mobile versions intended to work only part of the day up to several million rubles for full-fledged machines, only specially trained professionals can use these devices. Without a specialist nearby, rental ventilators will be useless.\n\nCurrently, at least according to official case counts, Russia is \u201cbehind\u201d many other countries in the typical timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 20, 2020, the country\u2019s national consumer welfare agency Rospotrebnadzor had reported 253 confirmed infections. The first confirmed death of a coronavirus patient in Russia occurred on March 19 in Moscow\u2019s Infectious Disease Hospital No. 2. The patient was 79 years old and chronically ill; her cause of death was recorded as \u201ca bursting blood clot, not pneumonia,\u201d said Moscow\u2019s chief pathologist, Oleg Zairatyants.\n\nMost Russians who have been infected with the novel coronavirus are currently being treated at Moscow\u2019s City Clinical Hospital No. 40. On the morning of March 20, the hospital\u2019s lead doctor, Denis Protsenko, wrote on Facebook that none of those COVID-19 patients has yet required artificial lung ventilation.\n\nSo it\u2019s not that bad? Russians have reliable protection from the pandemic?\n\nAn abundance of ventilators actually may not be a decisive advantage in this crisis. Vladimir Budyansky, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician who moderates the 14,400-member Facebook group \u201cMedical Emergencies,\u201d told Meduza that there are various kinds of ventilators. Some are advanced devices produced in the West that can provide 24-hour ventilation for patients experiencing health crises of various levels. Others are \u201cold-fashioned,\u201d in his words, and can\u2019t be used for contemporary lung ventilation procedures at all.\n\n\u201cOn top of that, artificial lung ventilation is quite a fine-tuned, complicated process,\u201d Budyansky said. \u201cIt requires a lot of other things [aside from the ventilator itself]. There are anesthetic devices that still allow for ventilation, but those are supposed to be for operations, and they don\u2019t have a range of settings. Using a ventilator with a patient in the ICU or the emergency room is something of a different, more complex task that can take five to 10 days, sometimes months \u2014 not several hours, which is what it can take on the operating table,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere are mobile \u2018ventilators\u2019 that are housed in ambulances \u2014 those are meant to ventilate patients for anywhere from one to 12 hours. In short, this isn\u2019t a single kind of device; it\u2019s a spectrum of various different devices. It\u2019s like with cars: Some are for driving off-road, and some are for driving in cities.\u201d\n\nAside from the question of whether the ventilators available actually fit patients\u2019 needs, there\u2019s the fact that if a patient has to be on a ventilator, they\u2019re already in critical condition. That means they need a whole set of critical care procedures, specialized equipment, and medical professionals who can use that equipment and put those measures in place. In Budyansky\u2019s opinion, this is where Russian medicine loses out to Italy.\n\n\u201cThe Italian healthcare system is considered one of the best in the world in all the rankings that are out there. It\u2019s always been in the top five. I\u2019ve seen their level of training myself. All else held equal, we\u2019ll have a relatively spotty situation with treating critically ill patients in some regions of the country,\u201d the doctor explained. \u201cTheir problem wasn\u2019t so much with the ventilators as it was with beds, with the fact that they had to turn operating rooms into intensive care units on the fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut let\u2019s say we take your average ICU: 20 beds, and each one has one person on artificial ventilation. We have the same equipment they do, there are doctors, there are nurses. I think that in a lot of situations, we\u2019ll have it worse for a variety of reasons. For example, when they say they don\u2019t have enough nurses, for them, that means there used to be one nurse per patient, and now, there\u2019s one for every two. Well, we\u2019ve got one nurse serving three or four or five already. So what\u2019s twice as bad as usual for them is two times better than what we have normally,\u201d Budyansky concluded.\n\nStory by Ivan Golunov, Alexey Kovalev, and Darya Sarkisyan English version by Hilah Kohen","tests":null,"ventilators":"['5,000 ventilators', '8,175 ventilators', '62,000 ventilators', '40,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

The neighbors\u2019 economies are intertwined.\n\nSo why is there such a big difference in cases?\n\nAD\n\nThe disparity reflects, in part, a time lag. Mexico did not report its first case until Feb. 27 \u2014 a month after the virus was detected in the United States. To date, the country has counted 993 cases, less than 1 percent of the U.S. total.\n\nAD\n\nBut Mexico is also pursuing an unorthodox strategy. It is relying less on tests, and more on its own disease modeling, to guide its response to the pandemic. As Central American neighbors declared emergencies in mid-March, Mexico kept its airports, shops and government offices open \u2014 the government didn\u2019t urge a broad stay-at-home policy until last week.\n\nMexico\u2019s approach amounts to a bet, its coronavirus czar acknowledges \u2014 \u201ca bet that\u2019s technically sound,\u201d Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell said in an interview. Authorities are wagering that they can fine-tune their response to the virus, even as it has outwitted health officials in the United States and Europe.\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes of that gamble are enormous. Mexico held off on harsh lockdown measures to allow citizens to work for a few more weeks. Nearly 60 percent of the labor force works in the informal sector \u2014 as plumbers, gardeners, taco vendors \u2014 and they have little or no savings.\n\nKeeping those workers home when it\u2019s not absolutely necessary, L\u00f3pez-Gatell said, can cause \u201cfrightening damage.\u201d\n\nBut if it turns out Mexico waited too long to introduce restrictions, analysts warn, it could suffer a crisis like Italy\u2019s or New York\u2019s \u2014 with far fewer resources. Mexico has half as many hospital beds per capita as the United States, and a quarter as many nurses, according to statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe health system will be overloaded much faster\u201d than in other countries, Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez-Pier, a former Mexican deputy health minister, said last week in a briefing sponsored by the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.\n\nTurmoil in Mexico typically generates fears of spillover in the United States \u2014 surges in illegal migration and narcotics, snags in trade. At the moment, though, it is Mexicans who are worrying about crossover problems. On Saturday, governors of three Mexican border states called on President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador to tighten controls to limit the arrival of the coronavirus from the United States.\n\nMexico has extensive experience with infectious diseases; it was the epicenter of the 2009 swine flu pandemic. But unlike many nations, it has not rushed to scale up testing. L\u00f3pez-Gatell, a respected epidemiologist with a doctorate from Johns Hopkins University \u2014 an institution currently distinguishing itself with a widely cited website tracking the pandemic \u2014 acknowledged that Mexico\u2019s official count does not reflect the real number of cases.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAny country in the world that takes public health seriously knows there\u2019s a portion of the epidemic that\u2019s visible, and a portion that\u2019s not visible,\u201d he said.\n\nHow deep is the undercount? Academic studies estimate that there are 10 to 15 times as many common flu cases each year as reported, L\u00f3pez-Gatell noted.\n\nBut the raw numbers aren\u2019t the point, he maintained. What matters, he said, is identifying when and where the virus starts to grow exponentially. Figuring that out is a bit like conducting a presidential election poll, he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t interview 300 million Americans,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a scientific method to know what is the size\u201d of the sample needed for an accurate survey.\n\nFrom the start of the outbreak, Mexican authorities tested likely coronavirus carriers \u2014 people with symptoms such as fever and dry cough who had recently visited a country with known cases. When a diagnosis was confirmed, officials tried to track and isolate the victim\u2019s contacts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAuthorities also watched for unusual spikes in seasonal flu cases. They didn\u2019t spot any.\n\nOn March 24, Mexico declared that the virus had moved to a new phase and was spreading unchecked in communities.\n\nSince then, monitoring stations around the country \u2014 in hospitals and primary-care centers \u2014 have been testing about 10 percent of suspected coronavirus patients with mild symptoms. Everyone with serious symptoms is tested, said L\u00f3pez-Gatell.\n\n\u201cThis allows you to have the information to construct estimates,\u201d he said.\n\nIn total, Mexico has conducted about 65 tests per million inhabitants. That compares with 2,250 per million in the United States.\n\nMexico\u2019s approach varies dramatically from the much-praised model of South Korea, which blunted the coronavirus curve through mass testing and aggressive tracking and isolation of victims and their contacts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCarlos del Rio, an epidemiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, says Mexico has moved too slowly.\n\n\u201cCountries that have done [extensive] testing are doing better than those that don\u2019t,\u201d said del Rio, the former head of the National AIDS Council of Mexico.\n\nAlejandro Macias, Mexico\u2019s former national flu commissioner, said there was not enough early testing to confidently determine when community transmission began. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was enough of a budget,\u201d he said.\n\nOthers say testing has been overemphasized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as though doing tests will solve the problem. That\u2019s not clear at all,\u201d said Samuel Ponce de Le\u00f3n, an infectious-disease specialist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. \u201cNo one has been able to replicate\u201d South Korea\u2019s success, he said.\n\nOf course, pinpointing when coronavirus cases started to explode was supposed to be only the first step in trying to tame the pandemic. The second was ordering tough measures to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d of illnesses and keep hospitals from being overwhelmed.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMexico closed down schools and most government offices last week, and urged citizens to stay indoors. By Saturday, though, the movement of people in Mexico City had declined by only 30 percent, L\u00f3pez-Gatell told reporters. He pleaded with Mexicans to stay home.\n\n\u201cThis is our last chance,\u201d he said.\n\nIf Mexicans haven\u2019t gotten the message, it might be partly the fault of the messenger-in-chief. For weeks, even as health authorities called on citizens to refrain from kissing and hugging, L\u00f3pez Obrador plunged into crowds of admirers, slapping backs and shaking hands. He has only recently stopped his rallies.\n\nState and local officials have criticized the federal government\u2019s strategy. And there is plenty of skepticism about the case numbers.\n\nAD\n\nBut medical experts say there is little doubt there are more cases on the U.S. side of the border. Californians and Texans have more and closer ties with Europe and Asia \u2014 regions with big outbreaks \u2014 than people living in northern Mexico.\n\nAD\n\nAnd in a telltale sign of the pandemic\u2019s toll, Mexico has had just 20 deaths so far, compared with more than 2,500 for its northern neighbor.\n\nIf there were a dramatically higher number of cases, Ponce de Le\u00f3n said, Mexican hospitals would be struggling with the same patient load currently overwhelming some U.S. hospitals. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t have that,\u201d he said.","tests":"['65 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Alejandro Melendez\/Getty Images\n\nLast weekend, 110,000 people attended the \u201cVive Latino\u201d music festival in Mexico City, which took place as scheduled despite several confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Mexico\u2019s capital. At the same time, while governments worldwide took drastic measures to slow down the spread of the disease, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, known as AMLO, traveled to the south of Mexico and met with adoring crowds, shaking hands and hugging and kissing supporters. During his daily press conferences, AMLO has insisted that his honesty and moral rectitude protect him from the virus and that the threat of COVID-19 is greatly exaggerated. \u201cI have great faith that we will move our dear Mexico forward, that misfortunes and pandemics won\u2019t affect us,\u201d he told reporters at a press conference on Sunday.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Mexico may seem low, but it has grown exponentially over the last week, from eight to 118, and the first death from the disease was reported on Wednesday night. Moreover, Mexico has very limited testing capabilities, and the official statistics are not a reliable indicator of the actual number of cases in the country. Although the government\u2019s position is that Mexico is still in \u201cPhase 1\u201d of the pandemic, meaning all diagnosed cases of COVID-19 are people who caught the virus while traveling abroad, most experts agree the virus is already rapidly spreading within Mexico and that the government\u2019s nonchalance about the situation could have disastrous results.\n\n\u201cWe need political leaders that are properly advised and understand the gravity of the situation,\u201d said Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. \u201cA lot of people in Mexico would die unnecessarily unless the government gets very seriously prepared for this.\u201d Getting seriously prepared means taking drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus, bolstering the hospital system, and helping people cope when the economy grinds to a halt.\n\nThe Mexican government has not yet imposed any travel restrictions nor encouraged people to stay home, and it seems very unlikely that the public health system, which suffered drastic budget cuts and shortages last year, will be prepared for the magnitude of the imminent crisis.\n\n\u201cThe current guidelines are \u2018wash your hands, don\u2019t touch your face, and avoid people who are coughing,\u2019 \u201d said Gordon McCord, a professor at the School of Global Policy & Strategy at the University of California San Diego. \u201cWe know from the experiences of Asia and Italy that if all you do is avoid people who are coughing, you\u2019re going to get an explosion of sick folks in the population, so that\u2019s coming.\u201d Italy, which after China has the most confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths to date, has 340 hospital beds per 100,000 people, which has proved woefully insufficient. Mexico, by comparison, has only 150 hospital beds per 100,000 people, less than half.\n\nAround 5 percent of coronavirus cases become critical, meaning they result in respiratory failure, septic shock, and organ dysfunction. These cases require intensive care to keep the patients alive, which is limited and more expensive. Doctors in Italy, which has an above-average number of intensive care unit beds for European standards (12.5 per 100,000 people), are being forced to decide which patients to keep alive and which ones to let die because there are not enough respirators available for all critical cases. Mexico\u2019s public health care system has 3,000 ICU beds in the entire country. That\u2019s 2.3 beds per 100,000 people.\n\nAccording to a prominent Mexican epidemiologist, who asked to remain anonymous because of possible hostility from government authorities, Mexico will see a spike in coronavirus cases in the next couple of weeks, and within a month the death toll will begin to rise significantly. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Mexico isn\u2019t taking the problem seriously enough. It\u2019s that it did not take it seriously when it should have, and now we are starting to see community spread,\u201d the doctor said. \u201cFrom my perspective, we have all the conditions for this to turn into a tragedy, similar to Italy, if not worse.\u201d\n\nThe government\u2019s nonchalance may be the result of previous experience. In 2009, the Mexican government took severe measures to contain the spread of a new strain of swine flu. Public life was virtually shut down in the capital for several weeks, which took its toll on an already struggling economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Mexico suffered its first recession since 2009 last year, and government officials have indicated they do not want to overreact to the situation out of concern for the country\u2019s economy. In a press conference last week, Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, Mexico\u2019s deputy health minister, told reporters that \u201cthe [2009] economic loss was directly related, in the most part, to the disruption of tourism, trade and services. \u2026 It is so important, with very careful precision, not to take preemptive actions that do not correspond to the magnitude of the risk.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear how L\u00f3pez-Gatell is assessing the magnitude of the current risk when no significant amount of testing has been done on the population. At the end of last week, the government had tested only around 500 patients. By comparison, South Korea, which has had some of the best results controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, has tested 270,000 people. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to the desire of the government not to pull the trigger too early while the number of cases are small,\u201d said McCord. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to do a multiphased approach, there\u2019s one thing you absolutely need if you\u2019re going to get the timing right, and that\u2019s data. Data means mass testing of the population so that you know in real time what\u2019s going on in terms of the epidemiology of this disease.\u201d\n\nL\u00f3pez-Gatell announced this week that the government will spend 3.5 billion pesos (roughly $147 million) on tests, protective gear, and other equipment to address the pandemic, and that widespread testing will begin next week. The government\u2019s equipment purchases are based on an estimate of 250,000 cases of the coronavirus over the course of the pandemic and 10,528 people requiring intensive care. That number seems absurdly low, considering that epidemiologists predict around half of the world\u2019s population could get the virus and that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s worst-case scenario estimate for the U.S., Mexico\u2019s next-door neighbor, is 65 percent of the population getting infected. Based on the CDC\u2019s projections, Mexico, which has a population of 130 million, should be planning for a worst-case scenario of 84.5 million infections and 4.2 million cases that require intensive care.\n\nSome new measures to curb the spread of the virus will be implemented in the next few days\u2014public schools are going on spring break ahead of schedule at the end of the week, most colleges are switching to online classes, and the country\u2019s biggest concert promoter canceled all of its shows until mid-April\u2014but the government still insists on delaying more significant measures, like travel restrictions and social distancing. \u201cIf one begins these measures too early, one extinguishes the will of society to keep them up,\u201d said L\u00f3pez-Gatell in a recent press conference. \u201cAnd although some of those measures might be useful now, they may be even more useful in the future.\u201d\n\nThat is simply not true. The more time and opportunity the virus has to spread in the population, the worse the situation is going to be later on. \u201cThe more you refrain from the social distancing message now, the longer people feel \u2018Let\u2019s go to the restaurants, bars, beaches one last time\u2019\u2014then the higher the spike will be in two or three weeks when this really hits the health system,\u201d said McCord. \u201cAnd I think everybody senses Mexico is going to be overrun.\u201d\n\nFor more on the impact of the coronavirus, listen to this week\u2019s Political Gabfest.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['150 hospital beds', '3,000 ICU beds', '340 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

Most of the ventilators made in Mexico are exported to the U.S., he added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVentilator capacity has become a growing concern worldwide, especially as COVID-19 overwhelmed supply in Italy and Spain, forcing doctors to choose who to save and who to let die.\n\nThe life-saving machines effectively breathe for patients struggling the hardest against the pneumonia caused by the coronavirus.\n\nSome leaders in Mexico see its production abilities as an opportunity for the Baja California region to be part of the solution to the worldwide coronavirus crisis and recoup some of the economic damage of a shutdown.\n\nOthers say Baja California \u2014 already an international leader in medical device manufacturing \u2014 needs to focus on producing ventilators for its own residents first, after coronavirus cases and deaths have gone up in recent days. The state had 58 confirmed cases and at least four deaths from the disease as of Friday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBaja California Secretary of Economy Mario Escobedo Carignan said the state will need at least another 1,000 to 1,500 ventilators for its own residents. The majority of the ventilators currently in Baja California are not from local manufacturers.\n\nThree companies in Baja California specifically produce ventilators, but those products are sold around the world, he said. Overall the medical device sector provides 71,000 jobs in Baja California.\n\nEscobedo said Mexico faces unprecedented concerns about the health of its population while confronting the coronavirus, making it necessary for businesses, the government and local leaders to adopt a more nationalistic mindset.\n\nThe federal government enacted regulations last week permitting only essential workers to continue operations. Medical device manufacturing is considered essential work, Escobedo said, but there\u2019s a caveat.\n\n\u201cObviously, all medical device manufacturing is considered essential, but only if you are selling to Mexico,\u201d he said. \u201cThe possibility of our workers contracting COVID-19 and risking their lives and the community is only going to be permitted if what they\u2019re doing is essential to Mexico.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf what a company is doing is essential to Australia or to New Zealand, we\u2019re going to have to suspend that process,\u201d he continued, \u201cand we\u2019re checking that all medical device companies are selling to Mexico. They don\u2019t have to sell a lot to Mexico, only a percentage, and if they want to expand their production, we will do anything we can to help them expand.\u201d\n\nHe noted that Mexico\u2019s president had inquired specifically about Baja California companies that could sell their products to the federal government after local demand was met.\n\nFlavio Olivieri, an economic development specialist and director of the Cali Baja Bi-National Mega-Region, a cross-border business group, said Tijuana manufacturing companies could consider donating a percentage of the ventilators they make for U.S. clients to Mexico\u2019s local and state governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur focus is tapping into the local capacities of mid-size contract manufacturing companies in Tijuana to produce a low-cost ventilator for regional needs,\u201d said Olivieri.\n\nCompanies across California and Baja California, from those that build rockets to those that supply energy, are quickly trying to shift their production capabilities to ventilators.\n\nU.S. medical device firm Hillrom is starting to build ventilators in Tijuana, while Vyaire Medical in Mexicali is boosting production of their ventilator parts, Reuters reported.\n\nSan Diego County officials said the collective ventilator capacity in local hospitals, excluding those run by the military, currently stands at 826. In Baja California, there are about 200 of the machines in both the public and private health sectors to serve some 3.3 million residents.\n\nBaja California\u2019s medical device industry has seen demand skyrocket for ventilators and disposable personal protection equipment like gowns, masks and caps, said Jazmin Jimenez, the director of a cluster of medical product manufacturers in Baja California.\n\n\u201cCurrently, based on the list of needs we have received for medical devices necessary for the pandemic, I am looking for companies that can develop these devices in Baja California,\u201d said Jimenez, who also worked as an engineer for Thermo Fisher, the company praised by President Donald Trump for ramping up production of coronavirus test kits.\n\nLuis Hernandez, the president of INDEX, or the Association of the Maquiladora and Export Industry in Baja California, said medical device manufacturing companies need help from the United States in encouraging Mexican officials to allow them to continue to expand operations.\n\nHe said some companies are meeting too much red tape to expand quickly enough.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cPick up the phone and call Mexico\u2019s president or the state governor and let them know this is essential work right now,\u201d said Hernandez.\n\nEscobedo said the coronavirus pandemic is going to cause countries and companies around the world to rethink how they operate.\n\nFor example, he said most of the medical devices produced in Baja California are shipped to Costa Rica to be sterilized there and then shipped back before being sold. Now, two companies in Baja California are changing their operations to sterilize the products locally.\n\n\u201cWe need to save lives and we need to save as many as we can now,\u201d said Escobedo.\n\n","tests":null,"ventilators":"['1,500 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

But the world can\u2019t afford for us to wait six months,\u201d said Howard Karesh, Hillrom spokesman.\n\nEven before the coronavirus pandemic drove demand for medical products through the roof, Mexico was the top source of imported medical devices for the United States. The $17 billion industry is one of Mexico\u2019s biggest export sectors.\n\nThat could now be a source of bilateral friction. U.S. reliance on imported medical equipment has been exposed as a strategic weakness during the pandemic, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Monday, while some in Mexico warn that the country may soon need the equipment for itself as cases rise.\n\nVentilator machines pump oxygen into the lungs of patients with acute respiratory problems, helping to avoid lung failure, which is common with the worst-impacted coronavirus patients. Shortages led to deaths in Italy.\n\nA Mexican medical devices association and Tijuana\u2019s local government both told Reuters that demand for ventilators has jumped 1000% following the coronavirus outbreak, which has caused nearly 4,000 deaths in the United States and more than 43,000 worldwide.\n\nRequests for other coronavirus-related equipment have also soared, with demand for thermostats up 150%, probe covers 300% and medical anti-bacterial solutions 430%, according to Arturo Perez, secretary of economic development for Tijuana.\n\nThe industry was on Tuesday included on a Mexican government list of \u201cessential activities,\u201d allowing factories to stay open despite a nationwide shutdown hitting most businesses.\n\n\u201cWe... must continue operating because we are going to save lives and mitigate the pandemic,\u201d said Miguel Angel Felix Diaz Alonso, treasurer of a Mexican industry association representing 76 medical manufacturers in Baja California.\n\nThe Mexican medical devices industry expanded 9% last year and in 2018 exports totalled $17.1 billion, the association said. Numbers on the volume of ventilators produced were not immediately available.\n\nAbout a third of all medical equipment in the United States was imported in 2018. Mexico was the top U.S. supplier, accounting for about 17% of total imports, according to a report by Fitch Solutions.\n\nHillrom, which manufactures ventilators in California, said it was due to increase production capacity of its Life2000 model five-fold on an annualized basis, and would also begin producing the machines in its Tijuana factory.\n\nNew Zealand firm Fisher & Paykel Healthcare said it was increasing Mexico production of humidification devices and associated consumables, which are used alongside ventilators.\n\nInteger, a U.S.-listed medical business, said it was increasing production of ventilator and patient monitoring device batteries at least threefold per month in its Tijuana facility.\n\nHospitals in the United States are also reporting shortages of medical N-95 masks, protective clothing and other equipment.\n\nStryker, which also has a plant in Tijuana, is expanding global production of defibrillators and patient hygiene, disinfecting and surgical protection products, as well as hospital beds and stretchers.\n\n\u201cWe are also exploring expansion into new product areas such as masks and we are working with...

The ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nMexico\u2019s approach contrasts with that of many nations, who have enacted wartime mobilization measures to boost production and stop local manufacturers exporting ventilators.\n\nMexico is several weeks behind the United States in terms of the spread of the coronavirus, with 1,215 confirmed cases and 29 deaths.\n\nBut with infection numbers growing and officials warning the health system could be overwhelmed, Lopez Obrador may find himself under pressure to capture more ventilator capacity at home.\n\nAlejandro Macias, Mexico\u2019s former pandemics tsar and chief medical adviser during the 2009 swine flu outbreak, forecast Mexico will need at least 30,000 ventilators during the peak of the crisis.\n\n\u201cIf I was the president...

{"country":"Mexico","publish_date":"04-06-2020 19:25","url":"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/coronavirus-killing-lopez-obrador-big-192551656.html","title":"Coronavirus Is Killing Lopez Obrador\u2019s Big Plans for Mexico","text":"(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Covid-19 has come to Mexico. Factories are shut, planes grounded, beaches empty. Some 2,000 are now infected and dozens dead; cases have been doubling every few days. For weeks, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador blithely ignored the lessons coming out of Italy, Spain and elsewhere. He held rallies, hugged supporters, kissed children and made fun of safety recommendations.\n\nWhen the federal government did finally announce social distancing measures to begin on March 23, the president wasn\u2019t the one who faced the nation. Instead he sent a Health Ministry undersecretary to urge citizens to stay home. Later the Foreign Minister, not the president, declared a national emergency.\n\nOnly now, two weeks later, has the president finally addressed the nation. His speech revealed his limits as a leader, and leaves Mexico unprepared to face the pandemic, rescue the economy or bring the nation together. This failure threatens not just his once sky-high approval ratings, but also the viability of his ambitious economic and political project.\n\nLopez Obrador\u2019s so-called Fourth Transformation aspires to bring back a paternalistic state even while cutting its size and assuring supporters that austerity will end corruption. Economically, its focus on energy and small farmer is a throw-back, as is its mission to cultivate a clientelistic political coalition based on cash handouts for the young and old, rural and urban.\n\nUnfortunately, as Lopez Obrador has sought to effect that transformation, his policy choices have made Mexico more vulnerable to the pandemic. Mexico was already one of the countries in the OECD least equipped for such a contingency, with just 1.4 hospital beds per 1,000 people, fewer than 10,000 ventilators for its 130 million citizens, and one of the lowest per capita levels of health care spending.\n\nBut under his administration, austerity measures have cut millions out of health budgets, and weakened the pandemic rapid response system set up in 2009 in the wake of H1N1 flu outbreak. The recent revamp of the public health system for some 50 million Mexicans has gone poorly. Its hospitals and clinics already struggle to treat diabetes, heart disease, or even keep basic medicines in stock. With tens of thousands more people ill, the system may crumble.\n\nCoronavirus is hitting Mexico\u2019s economy hard as well. Manufacturing (outside of medical equipment) has been brought to a standstill. Factories have been shut to stop the disease\u2019s spread. Orders have disappeared as global consumption plummets. The closing of the U.S. border to non-essential traffic makes sales all the harder.\n\nTourism has all but ended, staunching the flow of tens of millions of yearly travelers and their more than $200 billion in spending. Remittances are falling, as Mexicans in the U.S. and elsewhere face precarious economic circumstances. The Mexican Treasury predicts the economy could shrink up to 3.9 percent in 2020. International banks are more pessimistic, estimating declines of up to 8 percent.\n\nPublic finances are taking a hit. Mexico has never been particularly effective in collecting revenues. Now, as plants and storefronts shutter, revenue from value-added taxes and those on income will diminish even further. With international oil prices in freefall, the state-owned energy company Pemex is near collapse. Last year the finance ministry had to inject $5 billion to keep it afloat. The additional $2.5 billion in tax breaks the president announced won\u2019t be close to enough, as Pemex\u2019s barrels of oil now cost more to extract than they are worth. And this is all before Pemex lays out billions of dollars to build an unprofitable refinery the president refuses to put on hold.\n\nEconomists worldwide, from the left and the right, agree that austerity isn\u2019t the answer to the coronavirus shock. Fiscal hawks in nation after nation are on board with extra spending to limit the pandemic\u2019s domestic and global economic damage. Other Latin American nations have announced vast rescue plans, pouring tens of billions of dollars into tax breaks, company loans and grants, social programs, and public works. And Mexico has the added benefit of debt-to-GDP levels of less than 50 percent, giving the government space to borrow.\n\nStory continues","tests":null,"ventilators":"['10,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

REUTERS\/Issei Kato\n\nThe crisis has already arrived at Eiju General Hospital, a pink, 10-storey building in central Tokyo, which has reported 140 cases of COVID-19 in the past two weeks. Of those, at least 44 are doctors, nurses and other medical staff.\n\nOn a recent weekday, the glass doors of Eiju General were plastered with posters saying the hospital was closed until further notice.\n\nMore than 60 patients with the virus are still being treated inside. One person who was transferred to another hospital infected others, according to health officials in Tokyo\u2019s Taito ward.\n\nJapan has only a small fraction of the number of cases reported by its neighbours China and South Korea. Yet scenarios similar to that at Eiju General are playing out across Tokyo, as a dozen doctors and nurses in the city told Reuters there is a shortage of gear and staff even as infections surge.\n\n\u201cWe could empty out an entire ward and use it just for corona patients, but that means those patients (with other illnesses) will have to go elsewhere,\u201d said a doctor specialising in infectious diseases at a major hospital in the greater Tokyo area. \u201cIf we can\u2019t do that, it will lead to the virus spreading all through the hospital and lead to a collapse of our medical system.\u201d\n\nOfficial data tell a similar story. Tokyo\u2019s government said that as of Sunday, 951 people with COVID-19 were hospitalised; in a live YouTube address Sunday night, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said there were about 1,000 beds allocated for coronavirus patients in the city.\n\nEven as other countries have locked down borders and ramped up testing, Japan appeared to have side-stepped the kind of mass infections seen elsewhere - an effect some experts say was mostly due to a lack of testing. In the early stages of the epidemic, Japan was also weighing whether to postpone the Summer Olympics, a decision that eventually came in late March.\n\nSince mid-January, Japan has tested 39,446 people, while the United Kingdom has tested 173,784 and South Korea has conducted 443,273 tests, according to data from Oxford University.\n\nAuthorities have tried to test and track in a way that avoided overwhelming Japan\u2019s hospitals, said Hitoshi Oshitani, an infectious disease specialist on the government panel shaping the country\u2019s coronavirus policy.\n\nDespite that, the total number of positive cases nationwide nearly doubled in the last seven days to 3,654. Tokyo is now the largest hub for COVID-19 in Japan, with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.\n\nWith cases surging, officials said, some who tested positive have had to briefly wait at home or in outpatient sections of hospitals until beds became available. Koike said on Sunday that to ease the burden on medical staff, Tokyo would transfer people with mild symptoms into hotels and other accommodations starting Tuesday.\n\nHiroshi Nishiura, a Hokkaido University professor and member of a panel advising the government on its coronavirus response, said Eiju General, like many Tokyo hospitals, has no infectious disease department. That meant coronavirus patients were initially treated alongside everyone else, allowing the virus to spread.\n\n\u201cWe have not been able to clearly contain the contagion from the first wave,\u201d Nishiura said, referring to Eiju General. A spokesman from the hospital declined to comment on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, another hospital in Tokyo said three nurses and one doctor had been infected while treating patients. The next day, Tokyo saw its daily coronavirus cases top 100 for the first time, and on Sunday 143 people tested positive.\n\nA representative for the Tokyo government said Monday that \u201cthe medical system remains secure,\u201d adding that Tokyo was continuing to urge residents to avoid all unnecessary outings.\n\nSCRAMBLE FOR BEDS\n\nContagion is an enormous risk in dense Tokyo, a city of nearly 14 million people. Japan also has one of world\u2019s oldest populations, with nearly a third of the country - 36 million people - older than 65.\n\nAccording to Japan\u2019s health ministry, there are some 1.5 million hospital beds nationwide, but beds in negative-pressure rooms reserved for infectious diseases excluding tuberculosis have dwindled to just 1,882, with only 145 in Tokyo.\n\nThough people with COVID-19 do not all need such rooms, they still must be kept apart from other patients.\n\nIn recent days, Tokyo officials have been scrambling to secure 4,000 beds for coronavirus patients, asking hospitals to free up space in ordinary wards and even offering financial incentives, said one city official with direct knowledge of the planning. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t that much capacity (of hospital beds) left in Tokyo, so a (medical collapse) is no longer unforeseeable,\u201d said Satoshi Kamayachi, an executive board member of the Japan Medical Association, which has pushed Japan to call for a state of emergency. \u201cThe number of patients is clearly rising, so the situation is becoming more urgent.\u201d\n\nJAPAN\u2019S RESPONSE\n\nEven after Japan drew fire for how it handled patients on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, it did little to step up testing and preparations, some critics say.\n\nTokyo assemblyman Akihiro Suzuki wrote to Koike on Jan. 31, asking her to set up a medical and consultation system for coronavirus cases.\n\n\u201cThe response was slow and even now it\u2019s (too) slow,\u201d he said. Suzuki has submitted 10 requests since then asking for a range of measures, from procuring more ventilators to clarifying Tokyo\u2019s policy on treating critical patients.\n\nA representative for the Tokyo metropolitan government said the city had been preparing \u201cspecific medical measures\u201d since March 23 for a possible increase in cases, including securing more beds.\n\nA half-dozen nurses working at clinics and mid-sized Tokyo hospitals said that they had been told to reuse masks and were concerned about having enough staff to deal with a surge. Several doctors said they had been told not to discuss the capacity of their hospitals with the media.\n\nNurses told Reuters they were not sure whether their hospitals had enough advanced personal protective equipment like N95 masks and plastic gowns.\n\n\u201cThe other day I saw a news report that a nurse wearing a trash bag as protective gear died in New York and I wondered if that\u2019ll be me in the future,\u201d one nurse in her 30s told Reuters. Like many other medical workers, she declined to be named because she is not allowed to speak to the media.\n\nKasumi Matsuda, who works for the Japan Federation of Medical Workers\u2019 Unions and was a nurse for 13 years, said many of its 170,000 members had also reported a lack of protective gear.\n\n\u201cI think the system is already beginning to fall apart,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the number of cases rises in Tokyo, the Japan Medical Association and Tokyo governor Koike have asked the central government to quickly declare a state of emergency to reduce the rate of infections.\n\nSuch a declaration empowers governors to close public facilities and \u201cname and shame\u201d companies that refuse official requests. But it cannot force companies to comply.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nMedia reports on Monday indicated that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was preparing to declare a state of emergency this week after days of saying such a decision would be premature.\n\nOn Friday, a non-profit organisation that offers developmental aid abroad, said it would build a makeshift hospital with 1,200 beds by the end of April in a bayside shopping district of Tokyo.\n\nThe beds will be set up under tents in a parking lot of a museum of maritime science, a building shaped like a docked ship.","tests":"['443,273 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

In the early stages of the epidemic, Japan was also weighing whether to postpone the Summer Olympics, a decision that eventually came in late March.\n\nSince mid-January, Japan has tested 39,446 people, while the United Kingdom has tested 173,784 and South Korea has conducted 443,273 tests, according to data from Oxford University.\n\nAuthorities have tried to test and track in a way that avoided overwhelming Japan\u2019s hospitals, said Hitoshi Oshitani, an infectious disease specialist on the government panel shaping the country\u2019s coronavirus policy.\n\nDespite that, the total number of positive cases nationwide nearly doubled in the last seven days to 3,654. Tokyo is now the largest hub for COVID-19 in Japan, with more than 1,000 confirmed cases.\n\nWith cases surging, officials said, some who tested positive have had to briefly wait at home or in outpatient sections of hospitals until beds became available. Koike said on Sunday that to ease the burden on medical staff, Tokyo would transfer people with mild symptoms into hotels and other accommodations starting Tuesday.\n\nHiroshi Nishiura, a Hokkaido University professor and member of a panel advising the government on its coronavirus response, said Eiju General, like many Tokyo hospitals, has no infectious disease department. That meant coronavirus patients were initially treated alongside everyone else, allowing the virus to spread.\n\n\u201cWe have not been able to clearly contain the contagion from the first wave,\u201d Nishiura said, referring to Eiju General. A spokesman from the hospital declined to comment on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, another hospital in Tokyo said three nurses and one doctor had been infected while treating patients. The next day, Tokyo saw its daily coronavirus cases top 100 for the first time, and on Sunday 143 people tested positive.\n\nA representative for the Tokyo government said Monday that \u201cthe medical system remains secure,\u201d adding that Tokyo was continuing to urge residents to avoid all unnecessary outings.\n\nSCRAMBLE FOR BEDS\n\nContagion is an enormous risk in dense Tokyo, a city of nearly 14 million people. Japan also has one of world\u2019s oldest populations, with nearly a third of the country - 36 million people - older than 65.\n\nAccording to Japan\u2019s health ministry, there are some 1.5 million hospital beds nationwide, but beds in negative-pressure rooms reserved for infectious diseases excluding tuberculosis have dwindled to just 1,882, with only 145 in Tokyo.\n\nThough people with COVID-19 do not all need such rooms, they still must be kept apart from other patients.\n\nIn recent days, Tokyo officials have been scrambling to secure 4,000 beds for coronavirus patients, asking hospitals to free up space in ordinary wards and even offering financial incentives, said one city official with direct knowledge of the planning. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t that much capacity (of hospital beds) left in Tokyo, so a (medical collapse) is no longer unforeseeable,\u201d said Satoshi Kamayachi, an executive board member of the Japan Medical Association, which has pushed Japan to call for a state of emergency. \u201cThe number of patients is clearly rising, so the situation is becoming more urgent.\u201d\n\nJAPAN\u2019S RESPONSE\n\nEven after Japan drew fire for how it handled patients on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, it did little to step up testing and preparations, some critics say.\n\nTokyo assemblyman Akihiro Suzuki wrote to Koike on Jan. 31, asking her to set up a medical and consultation system for coronavirus cases.\n\n\u201cThe response was slow and even now it\u2019s (too) slow,\u201d he said. Suzuki has submitted 10 requests since then asking for a range of measures, from procuring more ventilators to clarifying Tokyo\u2019s policy on treating critical patients.\n\nA representative for the Tokyo metropolitan government said the city had been preparing \u201cspecific medical measures\u201d since March 23 for a possible increase in cases, including securing more beds.\n\nA half-dozen nurses working at clinics and mid-sized Tokyo hospitals said that they had been told to reuse masks and were concerned about having enough staff to deal with a surge. Several doctors said they had been told not to discuss the capacity of their hospitals with the media.\n\nNurses told Reuters they were not sure whether their hospitals had enough advanced personal protective equipment like N95 masks and plastic gowns.\n\n\u201cThe other day I saw a news report that a nurse wearing a trash bag as protective gear died in New York and I wondered if that\u2019ll be me in the future,\u201d one nurse in her 30s told Reuters.

Ethiopia as of midday March 31 had 25 confirmed cases of the virus. Transport has been banned in most parts of the country as government moves to curb spread.\n\nInfections have so far been recorded in the capital Addis Ababa, and in the oromia and Amhara regional states.\n\nAl-Amoudi who is owner of a mining firm Mohammed International Development Research and Organization Cos., MIDROC.\n\nHe was arrested on corruption related charges by the Saudi government back in 2017 but was released in early 2019 after the active intervention of Prime Minister Abiya Ahmed Ali.\n\nAmoudi, in his 70s, became a multi-billionaire investing first in construction, agriculture and mining in Ethiopia, where he was born, and then purchasing oil refineries in Morocco and Sweden. Forbes valued his fortune at more than $10 billion in 2016.\n\nMarch 30: Ethiopian regions ban transport\n\nFour regional states in Ethiopia have imposed a ban on transport as part of coronavirus containment measures. The regions are northern Tigray region (which has declared a state of emergency since last week.), Oromia, Amhara and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples region.\n\nPrior to the last weekend, cases were recorded only in Addis Ababa. Oromia recorded two cases on Saturday whiles the first two in Amhara region were recored on Monday.\n\nThe federal government led by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed closed all land borders even as the national flier, Ethiopian, continues a very scaled down operations of passenger flights concentrating more on freight.\n\nThe country currently has 23 confirmed cases out of which two have since been repatriated. Authorities say contact tracing efforts are underway whiles quarantined persons continue to be tested.\n\nMarch 29: Ethiopia reports cases outside Addis Ababa\n\nEthiopia at close of day March 29 had reported 21 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

They had history of contact with previously confirmed case. They were under medical follow up since the confirmation of the close contact and tested positive on March 28th 2020,\u201d a statement from the Ministry of Health read in part.\n\nOut of close to 900 tests, Ethiopia has recorded 21 cases, a recovery with two of the confirmed cases having been repatriated to their countries.\n\nMeanwhile more details are emerging from the state of emergency imposed by the Tigray regional state. Among other measures, coffee houses, cafes and juice houses shall be closed.\n\nAnyone who travelled out of Tigray in the past 20 days shall be tested. Anyone who enters Tigray after shall be tested and put under supervision.

It is a test against all humanity. We should fight it together and defeat it. I call upon all my fellow Ethiopians to join hands with the world to fight this global challenge,\u201d her post on Twitter read.\n\nIt is believed to be connected to a United States Embassy statement that alerted to rising anti-foreigner sentiments in parts of the country.\n\nThe embassy cautioned that foreigners were being targeted with the accusation that they were infected with Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by coronavirus.\n\nIn a security alert said as at March 18, the embassy: \u201ccontinues to receive reports regarding a rise in anti-foreigner sentiment.\u201d\n\nTypical derogatory comments such as \u201cChina\u201d and \u201cferengi\u201d (a reference to foreigners) have been \u201creportedly coupled with the label \u2018corona\u2019, indicating a disparaging view on the link between the outbreak of Covid-19 and foreigners in Ethiopia,\u201d it added.\n\n\u201cReports indicate that foreigners have been attacked with stones, denied transportation services\u2026 being spat on, chased on foot, and been accused of being infected with Covid-19,\u201d the embassy added.\n\nEthiopia recorded its first case last week of a Japanese national. The cases have risen to six, the sixth being of a British diplomat. Health authorities said they were testing over 900 people for the virus as part of contact tracing efforts connected to confirmed cases.\n\nAcross Africa, there is a view that most confirmed cases have been imported largely from Europe. Most index cases were of either European nationals or of Africans with recent travel history to Europe. There are sixteen deaths so far, as at March 19.\n\nU.S. president Donald Trump has been under fire on Twitter for referring to the coronavirus as \u201cThe Chinese Virus.\u201d Most people have called the reference racist especially with the WHO cautioning against tagging a global malady with a certain category of people.\n\nMarch 16: Ethiopia\u2019s COVID -19 rules: Crowd ban, free transport, regulate essentials etc.\n\nEthiopia confirmed the fifth coronavirus case on Monday (March 16), a day after it had recorded an increase of three in addition to the index case that was recorded last week.\n\nThe office of the Prime Minister issued a statement surrounding key measures taken by government to safeguard public safety and orderliness.\n\nThe COVID-19 National Ministerial Committee at its second meeting led by PM Abiy agreed on a number of measures aimed at addressing containment and potential spread of the virus.\n\nIt announced a 10-point measure that was set to last \u201cfor the next two weeks, subject to further assessments,\u201d the statement read. the measures included wide-ranging public bans, social interventions and regulating of economic activities propped up by the pandemic.\n\nLarge gatherings including sporting events had been banned whiles small gatherings required clearance from the Health Ministry.\n\nAll educational institutions with the exception of higher learning institutions were to be closed.\n\nReligious institutions and places of worship are tasked to limit gatherings\n\nA national hygiene and preventive measures movement launched from federal level to local levels\n\nGovernment announced allocation of budget for distribution of masks, soap, alcohol solutions and other items in critical locations.\n\nGovernment buses are to be availed free of charge to help control crowding in public transport.

In comparison, South Korea tests 8,996 for every million people, Singapore 6,666, and Malaysia 1,605.\n\nAsked by The Straits Times on Monday (April 6) about Indonesia's very low rate, Mr Achmad Yurianto, a government spokesman for Covid-19 management, said: \"We don't test based on the size of population, but based on contact tracing of positive cases as well as based on the visits to health facilities by people with Covid-19 symptoms.\"\n\nHe added that Indonesia is also doing rapid tests, but the number of such tests - and the number of any confirmation tests after this procedure - do not add to the Covid-19 national tallies.\n\nHe stressed that such rapid tests, which are not as reliable as the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, are used only to help with early \"screening\" of people who may have contracted the virus.\n\nAny close contact who is tested negative using a rapid test kit must redo the procedure after a period of time, while anyone testing positive would have to be confirmed by a PCR test.\n\nRapid tests are antibody tests, which determines whether a person has developed immunity to the coronavirus. These tests, however, have a limited role in diagnosis, according to experts, as it takes the body four days or longer after infection to produce antibodies, which would be too late for the purpose of quick detection and contact tracing.\n\nIndonesia's ranking among the likes of Ethiopia comes as a surprise as the South-east Asia's largest economy has a GDP that is at least three times larger than any of the three bottom-ranked countries. Indonesia\u2019s GDP per capita, often used as an indicator of a country\u2019s standard of living, is at least double.\n\nIndonesia has a GDP of USD$1.1 trillion (S$ 1.58 trillion), while Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Nigeria has a GDP of US$81 billion, US$250 billion, and US$375 billion, respectively.\n\nIndonesia's health ministry has been widely criticised for red tape in bringing in test kits, as well as equipment to read the PCR test samples.\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus: West Java governor calls on Jakarta residents to stay home during Ramadan\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself\n\nRelated Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic\n\nRecent media reports have also pointed out that the ministry's official Covid-19 death toll nationwide, currently at 209, is an understated figure contradicted by separate announcements by local governments in West Java and the Jakarta municipal government, which indicate a higher toll. This has raised questions about the health ministry's transparency and credibility in disclosing data, the local media has reported.\n\nJakarta, where about half of the national confirmed cases are from, issued a monthly figure on burials in the capital for March at 4,377, well above the monthly average of 2,745 burials last year and 2,774 burials the year before.\n\nOn April 2, Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan said 401 burials were conducted following the Covid-19 protocol. The national tally shows the fatality in Jakarta as only 99.\n\nMeanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah is among currencies that have weakened sharply against the US dollar as the coronavirus crisis deepened. The rupiah fell 15 per cent year on year on April 6, while other currencies that have seen sharp falls in the same period include the Mexican peso, which dropped 26 per cent, and the Russian rouble, 19 per cent.\n\nSome of these countries have spent a lot of their foreign exchange reserves to intervene in the currency markets. Experts, however, have argued that uncertainty and a lack of credibility pose the greatest threat to these countries' currency values, and improving transparency in their Covid-19 data and boosting testing rates would be the most effective measures to address their currency depreciation woes.","tests":"['16 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

There have been appeals for middle-class families to be given emergency aid too, he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing to eat, a human being can be violent especially if he sees his children without food and he\u2019s driven to tears,\u201d Duterte said, adding he has ordered the finance secretary to \u201csteal, borrow, I don\u2019t care,\u201d just to produce more emergency funds.\n\nThe government has targeted 18 million low-income families for economic rescue under the lockdown with a 275-billion-peso ($5 billion) budget in the next two months. Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told foreign correspondents Monday 16.3 billion pesos ($320 million) have been distributed so far.\n\nDuterte demanded that the aid be given more rapidly amid complaints of delays and confusion over who should get it.\n\nThe Philippines has reported 3,660 cases of COVID-19 disease, including 163 deaths.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, bringing its totals to 10,331 infections and 192 fatalities.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said at least 802 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from abroad amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States. Most of these cases have been detected in the past three weeks, inflating the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live.\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Tuesday repeated his public pleas for social distancing and lamented that young people were lining up at clubs and other leisure facilities at risk of becoming \u201cquiet spreaders\u201d of the virus.\n\nWhile South Korea\u2019s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING. \u2014 China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the coronarivus over the past 24 hours and just 32 new cases, all from people who returned from overseas.\n\nAnother 12 suspected cases \u2014 also all imported \u2014 were being kept under observation, along with an additional 30 asymptomatic cases. China now has 1,242 confirmed cases in treatment and 1,033 asymptomatic cases under isolation and monitoring.\n\nThe country that gave rise to the global pandemic has recorded 3,331 deaths and 81,740 total cases.

Security Council for the first time on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, behind closed doors.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s most powerful body has come under criticism for not addressing the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease. The council has in the past spoken out on two public health emergencies \u2014 HIV\/AIDS and Ebola.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved a resolution on April 2 recognizing \u201cthe unprecedented effects\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic and calling for \u201cintensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat\u201d the COVID-19 disease. Resolutions of the 193-member world body reflect global opinion but are not legally binding.\n\nDiplomats say the Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, is divided between its 10 members who are elected for two-year terms and some of its five permanent members \u2014 the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China.\n\nThe elected members have been pressing for a council briefing by Guterres and have circulated a draft resolution on the pandemic. France is drafting a rival text.\n\nDiplomats said the permanent members wanted a summit of their leaders before a council meeting, and were trying to arrange one as late as Monday morning, but that meeting failed to materialize.\n\nThe Dominican Republic holds the Security Council presidency this month and its spokesperson informed the media late Monday of Thursday\u2019s closed meeting to hear from the secretary-general.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Manufacturing giant 3M says it has an agreement with the Trump administration that will allow the company to continue to send N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America.\n\n3M says the company has a plan to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump had used his authority under the 1950 Defense Production Act to stop exporting such masks, also known as respirators. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting healthcare workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19, outraged many officials in Canada.\n\n3M issued a statement last week saying that could have \u201csignificant humanitarian implications\u201d for healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America. The company had said possible retaliation by other nations could actually lead to fewer of the masks being available in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nIn New York City, nearly 1 in 5 police officers were out sick Monday, many with flu-like symptoms.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD has a \u201cvery deep bench\u201d with about 36,000 officers and won\u2019t need to bring in reinforcements from other agencies, and police officials say there is no imminent need to move to 12-hour shifts.\n\nIn all, more than 2,220 people working for the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus. One detective and a dozen civilian employees have died from the disease.\n\n___\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he was saddened to hear British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken into intensive care as he battles the new coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAmericans are all praying for his recovery,\u201d Trump said during a White House press briefing. \u201cHe\u2019s been a really good friend. He\u2019s been really something very special, strong, resolute, doesn\u2019t quit, doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nTrump said he asked two \u201cleading companies\u201d to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help.\n\nHe did not specifically identify the companies, but said \u201cwe have contacted all of Boris\u2019s doctors and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going to take place but they are ready to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.\u201d Trump said.\n\n___\n\nThe USNS Comfort is now being used for COVID-19 patients.\n\nPresident Trump confirmed that he\u2019d called New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier Monday to let him know that the USNS Comfort can now be used for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to let him do it,\u201d said Trump, adding that the ship will will be used for patients from both New York and New Jersey.\n\n\u201cHopefully that will be very helpful for both states,\u201d he said.\n\nCuomo had tweeted shortly before Trump\u2019s news conference began that the ship would add 1,000 beds staffed by federal personnel.\n\n\u201cThis will provide much-needed relief to our over stressed hospital systems,\u201d he wrote.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is touting the end of a dispute with 3M to supply millions of masks to medical professionals on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nTrump said that the \u201c3M saga ends very happily. We\u2019re very proud to be dealing now with 3M.\u201d\n\nThe president said that the company agreed to deliver an additional \u201c55.5 million high-quality facemasks each month.\u201d\n\nTrump had invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to prevent 3M from exporting masks abroad.\n\nIt had sparked some fears that other nations would down on the shipment of medical supplies to the US.\n\n___\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office says Johnson is conscious and does not require ventilation at the moment.\n\nJohnson was admitted to St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital late Sunday, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nJohnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s health minister has reported the country\u2019s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nOlivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.\n\nThough some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that \u201cwe have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.\u201d\n\nFrance has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.\n\nThe total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the end of the month, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe.\n\nNew York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most impacted state with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized.\n\nBut the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as have the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said.\n\nWarning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29.\n\nCuomo stressed that even if New York has reached the peak, numbers could persist at these levels, which would continue to stress struggling hospitals.\n\n___\n\nNEW JERSEY \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 1,000 people, according to data released Monday from the state\u2019s health department.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003.\n\nNew Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials.\n\nBergen, Essex and Hudson counties in suburban New York have seen the most cases.\n\n___\n\nBATON ROUGE, Louisiana \u2014 Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says his state is starting to see hospital admission and death rates that could suggest new infections are slowing.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to real signs that these mitigation measures that we put into place weeks ago are starting to bear real results, and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re seeing the beginning of the flattening of the curve,\u201d the Democratic governor said at his daily press briefing, offering a hint of optimism in a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest per capita virus infection rates.\n\nThe New Orleans region isn\u2019t expected to run out of ventilators or hospital beds within days, as previously projected.\n\nEdwards cautioned that even if data continues to show that Louisiana has truly turned a corner in battling the outbreak, no one should celebrate by having an Easter crawfish boil or more trips outside of the house.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that I\u2019m telling people that and they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Oh, the task at hand is accomplished. We can go back to doing whatever it is we normally do,\u2019\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThat is exactly the wrong answer.\u201d\n\nLouisiana has nearly 15,000 people with confirmed infections. The state\u2019s death toll is at least 512.\n\n___\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s governor has added criminal penalties to his orders demanding people stay home unless going to work or the grocery store to fight the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster said people can call it a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order if they like. South Carolina had been the final state east of the Mississippi to not have that specific order.\n\nSouth Carolina has closed almost all stores that don\u2019t sell medicine, food, home improvement supplies, liquor or guns and banned gathering of three or more people. Anyone violating the governor\u2019s social distancing orders can be ticketed for a misdemeanor and face a $100 fine or 30 days in jail.\n\nMcMaster also says he has not been tested for COVID-19. The governor says he has followed protocol that says only test people with symptoms.\n\nAt 72, McMaster is the oldest governor in South Carolina\u2019s 350-year history as an English colony and state.\n\n___\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that because of the coronavirus outbreak schools will remain physically closed for the remainder of the school year and that the state\u2019s more than 1.2 million public and private K-12 students will continue distance learning until the end of June.\n\nWashington state had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.\n\nSchools have been shut statewide since March 17 and were originally scheduled to reopen April 27.\n\nNow, that closure is extended until midnight June 19 \u2014 when the spring term ends \u2014 and schools are encouraged to continue to provide distance learning. The order also asks schools to start planning for a potential expansion of the order into the summer and fall.\n\nUnder the order, some in-person and on-site services such as meetings with seniors to help finish up final projects and tutoring support is allowed only if social distancing and proper hygiene practices are followed.\n\nLast week, Inslee extended orders to keep non-essential businesses closed and most of the state\u2019s residents home through May 4, saying that social distancing measures must remain in place an additional month in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Eight more residents of a Virginia long-term care facility who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll amid the outbreak to 28, the facility\u2019s administrator said Monday.\n\nDeaths at the Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County have continued to mount since health officials tested every resident last week because of the scope of the outbreak. That testing showed roughly two-thirds of the residents had the virus.\n\nThirty-four residents were experiencing symptoms ranging from moderate to mild, and 54 of the residents who tested positive were showing no sign of being ill, the statement said.\n\nAcross Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health reported nearly 2,900 confirmed cases and 54 deaths Monday, figures that state health commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said at a news conference were \u201calmost definitely an underestimate\u201d because of a lack of widespread testing.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies chief said countries looking to exit their lockdown strategies need to use a \u201ccalibrated, step-wise approach\u201d that does not release all the restrictions at once.\n\nDr. Mike Ryan said Monday that the lockdowns seen in many countries involve shutdowns of schools, workplaces, and social gatherings in venues such as public places and parks.\n\n\u201cIt probably would be a bad idea to lift all the lockdown restrictions (at once),\u201d Ryan said, noting that countries shouldn\u2019t be looking to transition out of a shutdown without having a plan in place to keep the spread of COVID-19 to manageable levels.\n\n\u201cThe lockdown is pushing the disease down. Once you raise the lockdown, you have to have an alternative method to suppress the infection,\u201d Ryan said, explaining countries should have systems in place to detect cases, track contacts, quarantine suspect cases and test widely for the disease.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO \u2014 The premier of Canada\u2019s most populous province says U.S. officials have stopped 3 million masks from getting to Ontario from manufacturing giant 3M but he says 500,000 of them are being released Monday.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says getting masks across the U.S. border is difficult after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks.\n\nFord says he\u2019s hopeful Canada will get an exemption and says he feels better about that after speaking with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ford says he\u2019s grateful for anything he can from the U.S. after delays in global shipments and recent restrictions at the U.S. border have left Ontario with about a one-week supply of critical protective equipment for health care workers.\n\nCanadian health care workers \u2014 like those in the U.S. \u2014 are in dire need of the masks that provide more protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker began his daily briefing with a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s poor assessment of his performance.\n\nThe Democratic governor again went over what the state had received from the national stockpile and what the state had procured on its own.\n\nAs an example, he noted that the federal government had supplied 368,000 N95 masks and 693,000 gloves, while the state had procured 10 million N95 masks and 19 million gloves.\n\nAt the same time, Pritzker said the state\u2019s \u201c10-day burn rate for PPE\u201d is 1.5 million N95 masks and 25 million gloves.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who wants a response to some of the blame-shifting coming out of the White House, all I have to say is, look at the numbers,\u201d Pritzker said.\n\n___\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Motorists lined up in rows of cars at a mass drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in Atlanta.\n\nThe state of Georgia is partnering with CVS Health in launching rapid testing Monday at a parking deck on Georgia Tech\u2019s midtown Atlanta campus. Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan recently. Georgia has recorded more than 200 virus-linked deaths and more than 1,300 hospitalizations.\n\nTotal infections statewide exceed 7,000 and Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, leads the state with nearly 1,000 cases.\n\nExperts say they hope more testing will give a better sense of how widespread the coronavirus is in Georgia.\n\n\u201cRoll your window up, roll your window up!\u201d a police officer yelled at drivers as they approached the first of at least two checkpoints. Dozens of drivers pressed their photo IDs and cellphones against their car windows to show their appointment confirmations. Cars were then directed to another area where testing was being done.\n\n___\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 A West Virginia judge in the county with the state\u2019s highest coronavirus caseload has approved strapping ankle monitors to people who test positive but refuse to quarantine. The Monday order allows Kanawha County sheriffs to use the GPS bracelets if someone with the virus ignores an isolation order.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people violated the mandates, though one local official put the number at \u201ca few.\u201d Officials say at least 345 people statewide have the virus with four reported deaths.\n\nKanawha County, where the state capital of Charleston is located, has the most positive cases in the state with 56.\n\n___\n\nEleven residents of a central Indiana nursing home have died from COVID-19, Indiana Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said Monday.\n\nIn addition to the 11 at the Bethany Pointe Health Campus in Anderson, three workers there have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition, Box said during a state news briefing on the pandemic.\n\nThe state is helping to transfer residents there without COVID-19 symptoms to another skilled nursing home, Box said.\n\nShe said an outbreak in a nursing home had been her biggest fear from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis is a heartbreaking situation and illustrates what a brutal toll the COVID-19 can take on our most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, this will not be the last outbreak of this kind,\u201d Box said.\n\n___\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Dozens of Americans aboard a cruise ship that recently docked in Miami with coronavirus cases are still waiting to disembark because of new federal rules requiring cruise companies to bring them directly home to avoid more infections.\n\nTwo passengers died before the Coral Princess ship docked Saturday in Miami and a third died at a hospital. At least 17 passengers have been taken to hospitals. The Miami-Dade mayor said many foreign passengers have disembarked and been taken to the Miami airport where charter planes were ready to fly them abroad. But many of the 250 Americans on board continued to wait, two days after docking.\n\n___\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Polish lawmakers have voted to conduct the country\u2019s forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting because of the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nParliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament late Monday require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking re-election.\n\nTime was an issue for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled \u2014 before the pandemic hit \u2014 for May 10.\n\nAccelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.\n\n___\n\nGENEVA \u2014 The head of the World Health Organization on Monday denounced \u201cracist remarks\u201d by two French scientists for suggesting coronavirus vaccine testing should be carried out in Africa.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian who is the first WHO director-general from Africa, said decried \u201ca hangover from a colonial mentality\u201d at a time when he has urged \u201csolidarity\u201d among countries.\n\nHe was alluding to comments on a French news program Wednesday that prompted outrage. Dr. Jean-Paul Mira of Paris\u2019 respected Cochin Hospital floated the prospect of carrying out vaccine tests in Africa.\n\n\u201cIf I can be provocative,\u201d Mira said on LCI television, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we do this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatment, no resuscitation?\u201d\n\nThe idea drew agreement from another guest, microbiologist Camille Locht from the INSERM medical research institute.\n\nTedros retorted at a news conference Monday: \u201cAfrica cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop and WHO will not allow this to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a disgrace, actually, and appalling to hear during the 21st century from scientists that kind of remark.\u201d\n\nMira has apologized for the remarks.\n\n___\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s day-to-day increase in new COVID-19 cases has dipped again.\n\nThe nearly 3,600 new cases that authorities announced on Monday were the lowest day-to-day increase in 20 days. Another number boosting hopes in Italy\u2019s medical community was a small drop, for the third straight day, in the number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections nationwide.\n\n\u201cSubstantially, the data confirms the trend\u201d of a slowing of new cases and \u201cgives comfort that the measures of containment against the viral infection are effective,\u2019 said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pneumologist with Rome\u2019s Gemelli Hospital.\n\nItaly now has at least 132,547 confirmed cases, putting it just behind Spain in total known cases. There were 636 deaths in Italy since Sunday, up from 525 a day earlier. But Richeldi said that overall, a downward trend in deaths was holding, showing a decrease of 20 percent compared to a week earlier.\n\nOn Monday, Italy marks a month under national lockdown aimed at slowing contagion with the virus.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine received $1.2 million of aid from the United States amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, Ukraine\u2019s president said Monday.\n\n\u201cGrateful to the U.S. for allocating $1.2 million to Ukraine to combat COVID-19,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a tweet after a phone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe aid comes as the outbreak is taking a toll on Ukraine\u2019s economy, with the state budget deficit tripling and incomes plummeting. Ukraine, where 1,319 coronavirus cases have been registered so far, has been in lockdown since March, with the borders closed and the vast majority of businesses not operating.\n\nThe country\u2019s government hopes to get a $8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to keep the economy afloat.\n\n___\n\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 Slovakia\u2019s government has approved a plan to limit movement across the country over Easter in efforts to contain the coronavirus.\n\nThe restrictions will be in place from Wednesday till the end of Easter Monday.\n\nPeople will only be allowed to travel to work, do essential shopping or visit doctors. Only family members can stay together for any outdoor activities that will be restricted to take place only within one county.\n\nSlovakia is a Roman Catholic stronghold in central and eastern Europe. The government previously banned public gatherings, including religious services.\n\nThe government also approved a renewal of border checks with all neighboring countries between Wednesday and April 17.\n\nSlovakia has 534 people infected, two have died.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 A host of international stars including Chris Martin, Alanis Morissette, John Legend, Billie Eilish, Lang Lang, Elton John and Andrea Bocelli will perform in a live concert on April 18 to raise funds for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring a press briefing on Monday, Lady Gaga announced she too would be performing in the concert, calling the coronavirus pandemic \u201ca catastrophe\u201d and said she was praying for all those who were sick.\n\nShe made her remarks while wearing thick black-rimmed glasses and a sober plaid tweed blazer over a low-cut top.\n\n\u201cMy heart is very achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don\u2019t infect their family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all salute you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would also like to send my prayers to people who are losing their jobs and are having a hard time feeding themselves and their children,\u201d Lady Gaga said.\n\nShe added that in the past week, she and others have raised $35 million for buying much-needed protective gear for health workers, improving lab capacities and further research and development into possible drugs and vaccines to treat the new coronavirus.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https:\/\/apnews.com\/VirusOutbreak and https:\/\/apnews.com\/UnderstandingtheOutbreak","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['368,000 N95 masks']"}

He can direct private hospitals and medical facilities to house health care workers and serve as quarantine centers, and take over public transport operations to ferry front-line workers.\n\nBut even these measures have drawn criticism.\n\n\"No to emergency powers. The existing powers are already being abused,\" University of the Philippines law professor Jay Batongbacal said in a Facebook post, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nDuterte has jailed critics, harassed journalists and waged a controversial drug war, exposing him to charges of autocratic rule. Rights advocates fear the new powers will make it dangerous for local governments to express dissent over how best to combat the virus.\n\nFifty million Filipinos meanwhile remain under lockdown since Duterte ordered half the population to stay home last week. The main island of Luzon is a web of checkpoints to ensure people stay put.\n\nThe new law also gives Duterte the authority to reallocate items in the 2020 national budget for projects that would fight the spread of COVID-19. Under a $5 billion emergency fund, some 18 million low-income households would receive assistance.\n\nThe package also helps equip hospitals and bolster testing.\n\nAny accurate measurement of the coronavirus in the Philippines has been severely constrained by a chronic shortage of test kits. As of Tuesday, only 1,793 individuals have been tested nationwide.\n\nLast week, the Philippine Health Department said it has only 2,000 kits left. The Chinese Embassy in Manila said it will donate 100,000 test kits. Singapore contributed diagnostic kits on Tuesday that can perform 3,000 tests.\n\nOne bone of contention: who should be tested. Reports that VIPs \u2014 including senators, other officials and their relatives \u2014 were tested ahead of ordinary citizens have generated predictable scorn.","tests":"['100,000 test kits', '3,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

There have been appeals for middle-class families to be given emergency aid too, he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing to eat, a human being can be violent especially if he sees his children without food and he\u2019s driven to tears,\u201d Duterte said, adding he has ordered the finance secretary to \u201csteal, borrow, I don\u2019t care,\u201d just to produce more emergency funds.\n\nThe government has targeted 18 million low-income families for economic rescue under the lockdown with a 275-billion-peso ($5 billion) budget in the next two months. Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told foreign correspondents Monday 16.3 billion pesos ($320 million) have been distributed so far.\n\nDuterte demanded that the aid be given more rapidly amid complaints of delays and confusion over who should get it.\n\nThe Philippines has reported 3,660 cases of COVID-19 disease, including 163 deaths.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, bringing its totals to 10,331 infections and 192 fatalities.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said at least 802 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from abroad amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States. Most of these cases have been detected in the past three weeks, inflating the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live.\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Tuesday repeated his public pleas for social distancing and lamented that young people were lining up at clubs and other leisure facilities at risk of becoming \u201cquiet spreaders\u201d of the virus.\n\nWhile South Korea\u2019s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING. \u2014 China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the coronarivus over the past 24 hours and just 32 new cases, all from people who returned from overseas.\n\nAnother 12 suspected cases \u2014 also all imported \u2014 were being kept under observation, along with an additional 30 asymptomatic cases.

Security Council for the first time on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, behind closed doors.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s most powerful body has come under criticism for not addressing the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease. The council has in the past spoken out on two public health emergencies \u2014 HIV\/AIDS and Ebola.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved a resolution on April 2 recognizing \u201cthe unprecedented effects\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic and calling for \u201cintensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat\u201d the COVID-19 disease. Resolutions of the 193-member world body reflect global opinion but are not legally binding.\n\nDiplomats say the Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, is divided between its 10 members who are elected for two-year terms and some of its five permanent members \u2014 the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China.\n\nThe elected members have been pressing for a council briefing by Guterres and have circulated a draft resolution on the pandemic. France is drafting a rival text.\n\nDiplomats said the permanent members wanted a summit of their leaders before a council meeting, and were trying to arrange one as late as Monday morning, but that meeting failed to materialize.\n\nThe Dominican Republic holds the Security Council presidency this month and its spokesperson informed the media late Monday of Thursday\u2019s closed meeting to hear from the secretary-general.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Manufacturing giant 3M says it has an agreement with the Trump administration that will allow the company to continue to send N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America.\n\n3M says the company has a plan to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump had used his authority under the 1950 Defense Production Act to stop exporting such masks, also known as respirators. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting healthcare workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19, outraged many officials in Canada.\n\n3M issued a statement last week saying that could have \u201csignificant humanitarian implications\u201d for healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America. The company had said possible retaliation by other nations could actually lead to fewer of the masks being available in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nIn New York City, nearly 1 in 5 police officers were out sick Monday, many with flu-like symptoms.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD has a \u201cvery deep bench\u201d with about 36,000 officers and won\u2019t need to bring in reinforcements from other agencies, and police officials say there is no imminent need to move to 12-hour shifts.\n\nIn all, more than 2,220 people working for the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus. One detective and a dozen civilian employees have died from the disease.\n\n___\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he was saddened to hear British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken into intensive care as he battles the new coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAmericans are all praying for his recovery,\u201d Trump said during a White House press briefing. \u201cHe\u2019s been a really good friend. He\u2019s been really something very special, strong, resolute, doesn\u2019t quit, doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nTrump said he asked two \u201cleading companies\u201d to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help.\n\nHe did not specifically identify the companies, but said \u201cwe have contacted all of Boris\u2019s doctors and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going to take place but they are ready to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.\u201d Trump said.\n\n___\n\nThe USNS Comfort is now being used for COVID-19 patients.\n\nPresident Trump confirmed that he\u2019d called New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier Monday to let him know that the USNS Comfort can now be used for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to let him do it,\u201d said Trump, adding that the ship will will be used for patients from both New York and New Jersey.\n\n\u201cHopefully that will be very helpful for both states,\u201d he said.\n\nCuomo had tweeted shortly before Trump\u2019s news conference began that the ship would add 1,000 beds staffed by federal personnel.\n\n\u201cThis will provide much-needed relief to our over stressed hospital systems,\u201d he wrote.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is touting the end of a dispute with 3M to supply millions of masks to medical professionals on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nTrump said that the \u201c3M saga ends very happily. We\u2019re very proud to be dealing now with 3M.\u201d\n\nThe president said that the company agreed to deliver an additional \u201c55.5 million high-quality facemasks each month.\u201d\n\nTrump had invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to prevent 3M from exporting masks abroad.\n\nIt had sparked some fears that other nations would down on the shipment of medical supplies to the US.\n\n___\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office says Johnson is conscious and does not require ventilation at the moment.\n\nJohnson was admitted to St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital late Sunday, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nJohnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s health minister has reported the country\u2019s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nOlivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.\n\nThough some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that \u201cwe have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.\u201d\n\nFrance has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.\n\nThe total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the end of the month, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe.\n\nNew York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most impacted state with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized.\n\nBut the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as have the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said.\n\nWarning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29.\n\nCuomo stressed that even if New York has reached the peak, numbers could persist at these levels, which would continue to stress struggling hospitals.\n\n___\n\nNEW JERSEY \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 1,000 people, according to data released Monday from the state\u2019s health department.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003.\n\nNew Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials.\n\nBergen, Essex and Hudson counties in suburban New York have seen the most cases.\n\n___\n\nBATON ROUGE, Louisiana \u2014 Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says his state is starting to see hospital admission and death rates that could suggest new infections are slowing.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to real signs that these mitigation measures that we put into place weeks ago are starting to bear real results, and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re seeing the beginning of the flattening of the curve,\u201d the Democratic governor said at his daily press briefing, offering a hint of optimism in a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest per capita virus infection rates.\n\nThe New Orleans region isn\u2019t expected to run out of ventilators or hospital beds within days, as previously projected.\n\nEdwards cautioned that even if data continues to show that Louisiana has truly turned a corner in battling the outbreak, no one should celebrate by having an Easter crawfish boil or more trips outside of the house.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that I\u2019m telling people that and they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Oh, the task at hand is accomplished. We can go back to doing whatever it is we normally do,\u2019\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThat is exactly the wrong answer.\u201d\n\nLouisiana has nearly 15,000 people with confirmed infections. The state\u2019s death toll is at least 512.\n\n___\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s governor has added criminal penalties to his orders demanding people stay home unless going to work or the grocery store to fight the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster said people can call it a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order if they like. South Carolina had been the final state east of the Mississippi to not have that specific order.\n\nSouth Carolina has closed almost all stores that don\u2019t sell medicine, food, home improvement supplies, liquor or guns and banned gathering of three or more people. Anyone violating the governor\u2019s social distancing orders can be ticketed for a misdemeanor and face a $100 fine or 30 days in jail.\n\nMcMaster also says he has not been tested for COVID-19. The governor says he has followed protocol that says only test people with symptoms.\n\nAt 72, McMaster is the oldest governor in South Carolina\u2019s 350-year history as an English colony and state.\n\n___\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that because of the coronavirus outbreak schools will remain physically closed for the remainder of the school year and that the state\u2019s more than 1.2 million public and private K-12 students will continue distance learning until the end of June.\n\nWashington state had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.\n\nSchools have been shut statewide since March 17 and were originally scheduled to reopen April 27.\n\nNow, that closure is extended until midnight June 19 \u2014 when the spring term ends \u2014 and schools are encouraged to continue to provide distance learning. The order also asks schools to start planning for a potential expansion of the order into the summer and fall.\n\nUnder the order, some in-person and on-site services such as meetings with seniors to help finish up final projects and tutoring support is allowed only if social distancing and proper hygiene practices are followed.\n\nLast week, Inslee extended orders to keep non-essential businesses closed and most of the state\u2019s residents home through May 4, saying that social distancing measures must remain in place an additional month in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Eight more residents of a Virginia long-term care facility who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll amid the outbreak to 28, the facility\u2019s administrator said Monday.\n\nDeaths at the Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County have continued to mount since health officials tested every resident last week because of the scope of the outbreak. That testing showed roughly two-thirds of the residents had the virus.\n\nThirty-four residents were experiencing symptoms ranging from moderate to mild, and 54 of the residents who tested positive were showing no sign of being ill, the statement said.\n\nAcross Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health reported nearly 2,900 confirmed cases and 54 deaths Monday, figures that state health commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said at a news conference were \u201calmost definitely an underestimate\u201d because of a lack of widespread testing.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies chief said countries looking to exit their lockdown strategies need to use a \u201ccalibrated, step-wise approach\u201d that does not release all the restrictions at once.\n\nDr. Mike Ryan said Monday that the lockdowns seen in many countries involve shutdowns of schools, workplaces, and social gatherings in venues such as public places and parks.\n\n\u201cIt probably would be a bad idea to lift all the lockdown restrictions (at once),\u201d Ryan said, noting that countries shouldn\u2019t be looking to transition out of a shutdown without having a plan in place to keep the spread of COVID-19 to manageable levels.\n\n\u201cThe lockdown is pushing the disease down. Once you raise the lockdown, you have to have an alternative method to suppress the infection,\u201d Ryan said, explaining countries should have systems in place to detect cases, track contacts, quarantine suspect cases and test widely for the disease.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO \u2014 The premier of Canada\u2019s most populous province says U.S. officials have stopped 3 million masks from getting to Ontario from manufacturing giant 3M but he says 500,000 of them are being released Monday.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says getting masks across the U.S. border is difficult after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks.\n\nFord says he\u2019s hopeful Canada will get an exemption and says he feels better about that after speaking with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ford says he\u2019s grateful for anything he can from the U.S. after delays in global shipments and recent restrictions at the U.S. border have left Ontario with about a one-week supply of critical protective equipment for health care workers.\n\nCanadian health care workers \u2014 like those in the U.S. \u2014 are in dire need of the masks that provide more protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker began his daily briefing with a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s poor assessment of his performance.\n\nThe Democratic governor again went over what the state had received from the national stockpile and what the state had procured on its own.\n\nAs an example, he noted that the federal government had supplied 368,000 N95 masks and 693,000 gloves, while the state had procured 10 million N95 masks and 19 million gloves.\n\nAt the same time, Pritzker said the state\u2019s \u201c10-day burn rate for PPE\u201d is 1.5 million N95 masks and 25 million gloves.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who wants a response to some of the blame-shifting coming out of the White House, all I have to say is, look at the numbers,\u201d Pritzker said.\n\n___\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Motorists lined up in rows of cars at a mass drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in Atlanta.\n\nThe state of Georgia is partnering with CVS Health in launching rapid testing Monday at a parking deck on Georgia Tech\u2019s midtown Atlanta campus. Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan recently. Georgia has recorded more than 200 virus-linked deaths and more than 1,300 hospitalizations.\n\nTotal infections statewide exceed 7,000 and Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, leads the state with nearly 1,000 cases.\n\nExperts say they hope more testing will give a better sense of how widespread the coronavirus is in Georgia.\n\n\u201cRoll your window up, roll your window up!\u201d a police officer yelled at drivers as they approached the first of at least two checkpoints. Dozens of drivers pressed their photo IDs and cellphones against their car windows to show their appointment confirmations. Cars were then directed to another area where testing was being done.\n\n___\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 A West Virginia judge in the county with the state\u2019s highest coronavirus caseload has approved strapping ankle monitors to people who test positive but refuse to quarantine. The Monday order allows Kanawha County sheriffs to use the GPS bracelets if someone with the virus ignores an isolation order.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people violated the mandates, though one local official put the number at \u201ca few.\u201d Officials say at least 345 people statewide have the virus with four reported deaths.\n\nKanawha County, where the state capital of Charleston is located, has the most positive cases in the state with 56.\n\n___\n\nEleven residents of a central Indiana nursing home have died from COVID-19, Indiana Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said Monday.\n\nIn addition to the 11 at the Bethany Pointe Health Campus in Anderson, three workers there have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition, Box said during a state news briefing on the pandemic.\n\nThe state is helping to transfer residents there without COVID-19 symptoms to another skilled nursing home, Box said.\n\nShe said an outbreak in a nursing home had been her biggest fear from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis is a heartbreaking situation and illustrates what a brutal toll the COVID-19 can take on our most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, this will not be the last outbreak of this kind,\u201d Box said.\n\n___\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Dozens of Americans aboard a cruise ship that recently docked in Miami with coronavirus cases are still waiting to disembark because of new federal rules requiring cruise companies to bring them directly home to avoid more infections.\n\nTwo passengers died before the Coral Princess ship docked Saturday in Miami and a third died at a hospital. At least 17 passengers have been taken to hospitals. The Miami-Dade mayor said many foreign passengers have disembarked and been taken to the Miami airport where charter planes were ready to fly them abroad. But many of the 250 Americans on board continued to wait, two days after docking.\n\n___\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Polish lawmakers have voted to conduct the country\u2019s forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting because of the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nParliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament late Monday require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking re-election.\n\nTime was an issue for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled \u2014 before the pandemic hit \u2014 for May 10.\n\nAccelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.\n\n___\n\nGENEVA \u2014 The head of the World Health Organization on Monday denounced \u201cracist remarks\u201d by two French scientists for suggesting coronavirus vaccine testing should be carried out in Africa.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian who is the first WHO director-general from Africa, said decried \u201ca hangover from a colonial mentality\u201d at a time when he has urged \u201csolidarity\u201d among countries.\n\nHe was alluding to comments on a French news program Wednesday that prompted outrage. Dr. Jean-Paul Mira of Paris\u2019 respected Cochin Hospital floated the prospect of carrying out vaccine tests in Africa.\n\n\u201cIf I can be provocative,\u201d Mira said on LCI television, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we do this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatment, no resuscitation?\u201d\n\nThe idea drew agreement from another guest, microbiologist Camille Locht from the INSERM medical research institute.\n\nTedros retorted at a news conference Monday: \u201cAfrica cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop and WHO will not allow this to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a disgrace, actually, and appalling to hear during the 21st century from scientists that kind of remark.\u201d\n\nMira has apologized for the remarks.\n\n___\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s day-to-day increase in new COVID-19 cases has dipped again.\n\nThe nearly 3,600 new cases that authorities announced on Monday were the lowest day-to-day increase in 20 days. Another number boosting hopes in Italy\u2019s medical community was a small drop, for the third straight day, in the number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections nationwide.\n\n\u201cSubstantially, the data confirms the trend\u201d of a slowing of new cases and \u201cgives comfort that the measures of containment against the viral infection are effective,\u2019 said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pneumologist with Rome\u2019s Gemelli Hospital.\n\nItaly now has at least 132,547 confirmed cases, putting it just behind Spain in total known cases. There were 636 deaths in Italy since Sunday, up from 525 a day earlier. But Richeldi said that overall, a downward trend in deaths was holding, showing a decrease of 20 percent compared to a week earlier.\n\nOn Monday, Italy marks a month under national lockdown aimed at slowing contagion with the virus.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine received $1.2 million of aid from the United States amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, Ukraine\u2019s president said Monday.\n\n\u201cGrateful to the U.S. for allocating $1.2 million to Ukraine to combat COVID-19,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a tweet after a phone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe aid comes as the outbreak is taking a toll on Ukraine\u2019s economy, with the state budget deficit tripling and incomes plummeting. Ukraine, where 1,319 coronavirus cases have been registered so far, has been in lockdown since March, with the borders closed and the vast majority of businesses not operating.\n\nThe country\u2019s government hopes to get a $8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to keep the economy afloat.\n\n___\n\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 Slovakia\u2019s government has approved a plan to limit movement across the country over Easter in efforts to contain the coronavirus.\n\nThe restrictions will be in place from Wednesday till the end of Easter Monday.\n\nPeople will only be allowed to travel to work, do essential shopping or visit doctors. Only family members can stay together for any outdoor activities that will be restricted to take place only within one county.\n\nSlovakia is a Roman Catholic stronghold in central and eastern Europe. The government previously banned public gatherings, including religious services.\n\nThe government also approved a renewal of border checks with all neighboring countries between Wednesday and April 17.\n\nSlovakia has 534 people infected, two have died.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 A host of international stars including Chris Martin, Alanis Morissette, John Legend, Billie Eilish, Lang Lang, Elton John and Andrea Bocelli will perform in a live concert on April 18 to raise funds for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring a press briefing on Monday, Lady Gaga announced she too would be performing in the concert, calling the coronavirus pandemic \u201ca catastrophe\u201d and said she was praying for all those who were sick.\n\nShe made her remarks while wearing thick black-rimmed glasses and a sober plaid tweed blazer over a low-cut top.\n\n\u201cMy heart is very achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don\u2019t infect their family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all salute you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would also like to send my prayers to people who are losing their jobs and are having a hard time feeding themselves and their children,\u201d Lady Gaga said.\n\nShe added that in the past week, she and others have raised $35 million for buying much-needed protective gear for health workers, improving lab capacities and further research and development into possible drugs and vaccines to treat the new coronavirus.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https:\/\/apnews.com\/VirusOutbreak and https:\/\/apnews.com\/UnderstandingtheOutbreak","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['368,000 N95 masks']"}

There have been appeals for middle-class families to be given emergency aid too, he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing to eat, a human being can be violent especially if he sees his children without food and he\u2019s driven to tears,\u201d Duterte said, adding he has ordered the finance secretary to \u201csteal, borrow, I don\u2019t care,\u201d just to produce more emergency funds.\n\nThe government has targeted 18 million low-income families for economic rescue under the lockdown with a 275-billion-peso ($5 billion) budget in the next two months. Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told foreign correspondents Monday 16.3 billion pesos ($320 million) have been distributed so far.\n\nDuterte demanded that the aid be given more rapidly amid complaints of delays and confusion over who should get it.\n\nThe Philippines has reported 3,660 cases of COVID-19 disease, including 163 deaths.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, bringing its totals to 10,331 infections and 192 fatalities.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said at least 802 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from abroad amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States. Most of these cases have been detected in the past three weeks, inflating the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live.\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Tuesday repeated his public pleas for social distancing and lamented that young people were lining up at clubs and other leisure facilities at risk of becoming \u201cquiet spreaders\u201d of the virus.\n\nWhile South Korea\u2019s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING. \u2014 China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the coronarivus over the past 24 hours and just 32 new cases, all from people who returned from overseas.\n\nAnother 12 suspected cases \u2014 also all imported \u2014 were being kept under observation, along with an additional 30 asymptomatic cases.

Security Council for the first time on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, behind closed doors.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s most powerful body has come under criticism for not addressing the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease. The council has in the past spoken out on two public health emergencies \u2014 HIV\/AIDS and Ebola.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved a resolution on April 2 recognizing \u201cthe unprecedented effects\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic and calling for \u201cintensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat\u201d the COVID-19 disease. Resolutions of the 193-member world body reflect global opinion but are not legally binding.\n\nDiplomats say the Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, is divided between its 10 members who are elected for two-year terms and some of its five permanent members \u2014 the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China.\n\nThe elected members have been pressing for a council briefing by Guterres and have circulated a draft resolution on the pandemic. France is drafting a rival text.\n\nDiplomats said the permanent members wanted a summit of their leaders before a council meeting, and were trying to arrange one as late as Monday morning, but that meeting failed to materialize.\n\nThe Dominican Republic holds the Security Council presidency this month and its spokesperson informed the media late Monday of Thursday\u2019s closed meeting to hear from the secretary-general.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Manufacturing giant 3M says it has an agreement with the Trump administration that will allow the company to continue to send N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America.\n\n3M says the company has a plan to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump had used his authority under the 1950 Defense Production Act to stop exporting such masks, also known as respirators. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting healthcare workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19, outraged many officials in Canada.\n\n3M issued a statement last week saying that could have \u201csignificant humanitarian implications\u201d for healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America. The company had said possible retaliation by other nations could actually lead to fewer of the masks being available in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nIn New York City, nearly 1 in 5 police officers were out sick Monday, many with flu-like symptoms.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD has a \u201cvery deep bench\u201d with about 36,000 officers and won\u2019t need to bring in reinforcements from other agencies, and police officials say there is no imminent need to move to 12-hour shifts.\n\nIn all, more than 2,220 people working for the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus.

We\u2019re very proud to be dealing now with 3M.\u201d\n\nThe president said that the company agreed to deliver an additional \u201c55.5 million high-quality facemasks each month.\u201d\n\nTrump had invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to prevent 3M from exporting masks abroad.\n\nIt had sparked some fears that other nations would down on the shipment of medical supplies to the US.\n\n___\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office says Johnson is conscious and does not require ventilation at the moment.\n\nJohnson was admitted to St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital late Sunday, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nJohnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s health minister has reported the country\u2019s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nOlivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.\n\nThough some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that \u201cwe have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.\u201d\n\nFrance has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.\n\nThe total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the end of the month, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe.\n\nNew York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most impacted state with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized.\n\nBut the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as have the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said.\n\nWarning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29.\n\nCuomo stressed that even if New York has reached the peak, numbers could persist at these levels, which would continue to stress struggling hospitals.\n\n___\n\nNEW JERSEY \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 1,000 people, according to data released Monday from the state\u2019s health department.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003.\n\nNew Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials.\n\nBergen, Essex and Hudson counties in suburban New York have seen the most cases.\n\n___\n\nBATON ROUGE, Louisiana \u2014 Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says his state is starting to see hospital admission and death rates that could suggest new infections are slowing.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to real signs that these mitigation measures that we put into place weeks ago are starting to bear real results, and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re seeing the beginning of the flattening of the curve,\u201d the Democratic governor said at his daily press briefing, offering a hint of optimism in a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest per capita virus infection rates.\n\nThe New Orleans region isn\u2019t expected to run out of ventilators or hospital beds within days, as previously projected.\n\nEdwards cautioned that even if data continues to show that Louisiana has truly turned a corner in battling the outbreak, no one should celebrate by having an Easter crawfish boil or more trips outside of the house.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that I\u2019m telling people that and they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Oh, the task at hand is accomplished. We can go back to doing whatever it is we normally do,\u2019\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThat is exactly the wrong answer.\u201d\n\nLouisiana has nearly 15,000 people with confirmed infections. The state\u2019s death toll is at least 512.\n\n___\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s governor has added criminal penalties to his orders demanding people stay home unless going to work or the grocery store to fight the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster said people can call it a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order if they like. South Carolina had been the final state east of the Mississippi to not have that specific order.\n\nSouth Carolina has closed almost all stores that don\u2019t sell medicine, food, home improvement supplies, liquor or guns and banned gathering of three or more people. Anyone violating the governor\u2019s social distancing orders can be ticketed for a misdemeanor and face a $100 fine or 30 days in jail.\n\nMcMaster also says he has not been tested for COVID-19. The governor says he has followed protocol that says only test people with symptoms.\n\nAt 72, McMaster is the oldest governor in South Carolina\u2019s 350-year history as an English colony and state.\n\n___\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that because of the coronavirus outbreak schools will remain physically closed for the remainder of the school year and that the state\u2019s more than 1.2 million public and private K-12 students will continue distance learning until the end of June.\n\nWashington state had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.\n\nSchools have been shut statewide since March 17 and were originally scheduled to reopen April 27.\n\nNow, that closure is extended until midnight June 19 \u2014 when the spring term ends \u2014 and schools are encouraged to continue to provide distance learning. The order also asks schools to start planning for a potential expansion of the order into the summer and fall.\n\nUnder the order, some in-person and on-site services such as meetings with seniors to help finish up final projects and tutoring support is allowed only if social distancing and proper hygiene practices are followed.\n\nLast week, Inslee extended orders to keep non-essential businesses closed and most of the state\u2019s residents home through May 4, saying that social distancing measures must remain in place an additional month in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Eight more residents of a Virginia long-term care facility who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll amid the outbreak to 28, the facility\u2019s administrator said Monday.\n\nDeaths at the Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County have continued to mount since health officials tested every resident last week because of the scope of the outbreak. That testing showed roughly two-thirds of the residents had the virus.\n\nThirty-four residents were experiencing symptoms ranging from moderate to mild, and 54 of the residents who tested positive were showing no sign of being ill, the statement said.\n\nAcross Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health reported nearly 2,900 confirmed cases and 54 deaths Monday, figures that state health commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said at a news conference were \u201calmost definitely an underestimate\u201d because of a lack of widespread testing.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 The World Health Organization\u2019s emergencies chief said countries looking to exit their lockdown strategies need to use a \u201ccalibrated, step-wise approach\u201d that does not release all the restrictions at once.\n\nDr. Mike Ryan said Monday that the lockdowns seen in many countries involve shutdowns of schools, workplaces, and social gatherings in venues such as public places and parks.\n\n\u201cIt probably would be a bad idea to lift all the lockdown restrictions (at once),\u201d Ryan said, noting that countries shouldn\u2019t be looking to transition out of a shutdown without having a plan in place to keep the spread of COVID-19 to manageable levels.\n\n\u201cThe lockdown is pushing the disease down. Once you raise the lockdown, you have to have an alternative method to suppress the infection,\u201d Ryan said, explaining countries should have systems in place to detect cases, track contacts, quarantine suspect cases and test widely for the disease.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO \u2014 The premier of Canada\u2019s most populous province says U.S. officials have stopped 3 million masks from getting to Ontario from manufacturing giant 3M but he says 500,000 of them are being released Monday.\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford says getting masks across the U.S. border is difficult after the Trump administration announced it would prevent the export of N95 protective masks.\n\nFord says he\u2019s hopeful Canada will get an exemption and says he feels better about that after speaking with United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. Ford says he\u2019s grateful for anything he can from the U.S. after delays in global shipments and recent restrictions at the U.S. border have left Ontario with about a one-week supply of critical protective equipment for health care workers.\n\nCanadian health care workers \u2014 like those in the U.S. \u2014 are in dire need of the masks that provide more protection against the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker began his daily briefing with a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s poor assessment of his performance.\n\nThe Democratic governor again went over what the state had received from the national stockpile and what the state had procured on its own.\n\nAs an example, he noted that the federal government had supplied 368,000 N95 masks and 693,000 gloves, while the state had procured 10 million N95 masks and 19 million gloves.\n\nAt the same time, Pritzker said the state\u2019s \u201c10-day burn rate for PPE\u201d is 1.5 million N95 masks and 25 million gloves.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who wants a response to some of the blame-shifting coming out of the White House, all I have to say is, look at the numbers,\u201d Pritzker said.\n\n___\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Motorists lined up in rows of cars at a mass drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in Atlanta.\n\nThe state of Georgia is partnering with CVS Health in launching rapid testing Monday at a parking deck on Georgia Tech\u2019s midtown Atlanta campus. Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan recently. Georgia has recorded more than 200 virus-linked deaths and more than 1,300 hospitalizations.\n\nTotal infections statewide exceed 7,000 and Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, leads the state with nearly 1,000 cases.\n\nExperts say they hope more testing will give a better sense of how widespread the coronavirus is in Georgia.\n\n\u201cRoll your window up, roll your window up!\u201d a police officer yelled at drivers as they approached the first of at least two checkpoints. Dozens of drivers pressed their photo IDs and cellphones against their car windows to show their appointment confirmations. Cars were then directed to another area where testing was being done.\n\n___\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 A West Virginia judge in the county with the state\u2019s highest coronavirus caseload has approved strapping ankle monitors to people who test positive but refuse to quarantine. The Monday order allows Kanawha County sheriffs to use the GPS bracelets if someone with the virus ignores an isolation order.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people violated the mandates, though one local official put the number at \u201ca few.\u201d Officials say at least 345 people statewide have the virus with four reported deaths.\n\nKanawha County, where the state capital of Charleston is located, has the most positive cases in the state with 56.\n\n___\n\nEleven residents of a central Indiana nursing home have died from COVID-19, Indiana Health Commissioner Dr. Kristina Box said Monday.\n\nIn addition to the 11 at the Bethany Pointe Health Campus in Anderson, three workers there have been hospitalized, including two in critical condition, Box said during a state news briefing on the pandemic.\n\nThe state is helping to transfer residents there without COVID-19 symptoms to another skilled nursing home, Box said.\n\nShe said an outbreak in a nursing home had been her biggest fear from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis is a heartbreaking situation and illustrates what a brutal toll the COVID-19 can take on our most vulnerable populations. Unfortunately, this will not be the last outbreak of this kind,\u201d Box said.\n\n___\n\nMIAMI \u2014 Dozens of Americans aboard a cruise ship that recently docked in Miami with coronavirus cases are still waiting to disembark because of new federal rules requiring cruise companies to bring them directly home to avoid more infections.\n\nTwo passengers died before the Coral Princess ship docked Saturday in Miami and a third died at a hospital. At least 17 passengers have been taken to hospitals. The Miami-Dade mayor said many foreign passengers have disembarked and been taken to the Miami airport where charter planes were ready to fly them abroad. But many of the 250 Americans on board continued to wait, two days after docking.\n\n___\n\nWARSAW, Poland \u2014 Polish lawmakers have voted to conduct the country\u2019s forthcoming presidential elections exclusively through postal voting because of the lockdown imposed for the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nParliament also empowered house speaker Elzbieta Witek to push back the date of the election, if necessary. Both decisions by parliament late Monday require approval from the Senate and from President Andrzej Duda, who is seeking re-election.\n\nTime was an issue for a decision on whether and how to hold the election that had been scheduled \u2014 before the pandemic hit \u2014 for May 10.\n\nAccelerating infections and strict containment measures would make it impossible for people to vote as usual, at polling stations.\n\n___\n\nGENEVA \u2014 The head of the World Health Organization on Monday denounced \u201cracist remarks\u201d by two French scientists for suggesting coronavirus vaccine testing should be carried out in Africa.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, an Ethiopian who is the first WHO director-general from Africa, said decried \u201ca hangover from a colonial mentality\u201d at a time when he has urged \u201csolidarity\u201d among countries.\n\nHe was alluding to comments on a French news program Wednesday that prompted outrage. Dr. Jean-Paul Mira of Paris\u2019 respected Cochin Hospital floated the prospect of carrying out vaccine tests in Africa.\n\n\u201cIf I can be provocative,\u201d Mira said on LCI television, \u201cShouldn\u2019t we do this study in Africa, where there are no masks, no treatment, no resuscitation?\u201d\n\nThe idea drew agreement from another guest, microbiologist Camille Locht from the INSERM medical research institute.\n\nTedros retorted at a news conference Monday: \u201cAfrica cannot and will not be a testing ground for any vaccine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hangover from a colonial mentality has to stop and WHO will not allow this to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a disgrace, actually, and appalling to hear during the 21st century from scientists that kind of remark.\u201d\n\nMira has apologized for the remarks.\n\n___\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s day-to-day increase in new COVID-19 cases has dipped again.\n\nThe nearly 3,600 new cases that authorities announced on Monday were the lowest day-to-day increase in 20 days. Another number boosting hopes in Italy\u2019s medical community was a small drop, for the third straight day, in the number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections nationwide.\n\n\u201cSubstantially, the data confirms the trend\u201d of a slowing of new cases and \u201cgives comfort that the measures of containment against the viral infection are effective,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pneumologist with Rome\u2019s Gemelli Hospital.\n\nItaly now has at least 132,547 confirmed cases, putting it just behind Spain in total known cases. There were 636 deaths in Italy since Sunday, up from 525 a day earlier. But Richeldi said that overall, a downward trend in deaths was holding, showing a decrease of 20 percent compared to a week earlier.\n\nOn Monday, Italy marks a month under national lockdown aimed at slowing contagion with the virus.\n\n___\n\nKYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine received $1.2 million of aid from the United States amid the growing coronavirus pandemic, Ukraine\u2019s president said Monday.\n\n\u201cGrateful to the U.S. for allocating $1.2 million to Ukraine to combat COVID-19,\u201d Zelenskiy said in a tweet after a phone conversation with the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nThe aid comes as the outbreak is taking a toll on Ukraine\u2019s economy, with the state budget deficit tripling and incomes plummeting. Ukraine, where 1,319 coronavirus cases have been registered so far, has been in lockdown since March, with the borders closed and the vast majority of businesses not operating.\n\nThe country\u2019s government hopes to get a $8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to keep the economy afloat.\n\n___\n\nBRATISLAVA, Slovakia \u2014 Slovakia\u2019s government has approved a plan to limit movement across the country over Easter in efforts to contain the coronavirus.\n\nThe restrictions will be in place from Wednesday till the end of Easter Monday.\n\nPeople will only be allowed to travel to work, do essential shopping or visit doctors. Only family members can stay together for any outdoor activities that will be restricted to take place only within one county.\n\nSlovakia is a Roman Catholic stronghold in central and eastern Europe. The government previously banned public gatherings, including religious services.\n\nThe government also approved a renewal of border checks with all neighboring countries between Wednesday and April 17.\n\nSlovakia has 534 people infected, two have died.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 A host of international stars including Chris Martin, Alanis Morissette, John Legend, Billie Eilish, Lang Lang, Elton John and Andrea Bocelli will perform in a live concert on April 18 to raise funds for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring a press briefing on Monday, Lady Gaga announced she too would be performing in the concert, calling the coronavirus pandemic \u201ca catastrophe\u201d and said she was praying for all those who were sick.\n\nShe made her remarks while wearing thick black-rimmed glasses and a sober plaid tweed blazer over a low-cut top.\n\n\u201cMy heart is very achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don\u2019t infect their family,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all salute you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would also like to send my prayers to people who are losing their jobs and are having a hard time feeding themselves and their children,\u201d Lady Gaga said.\n\nShe added that in the past week, she and others have raised $35 million for buying much-needed protective gear for health workers, improving lab capacities and further research and development into possible drugs and vaccines to treat the new coronavirus.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https:\/\/apnews.com\/VirusOutbreak and https:\/\/apnews.com\/UnderstandingtheOutbreak","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['368,000 N95 masks']"}

The world is currently threatened by a disease that is more contagious than SARS, which brings up the necessary question: will the world cooperate and unite in solidarity to fight this global pandemic?\n\nIn a video conference with over 100 international development organization representatives, Rania Al Mashat, Egypt\u2019s Minister of International Cooperation, presented a forward-looking strategy, New Global Partnership Narrative, which prioritizes cooperation among international development partners as well as the achievement of UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\n\u201cStreamlining efforts under one\n\numbrella: mindful mobilization.\u201d\n\nThe strategy, in short, aims to streamline all efforts under one umbrella: mindful mobilization. Rather than focusing on short-term solutions, it hopes to ensure that the promotion of future collaborations is based on an up-to-date, consistent and a complete narrative between the Government of Egypt and its multilateral and bilateral development partners.\n\nDina Saleh, director of the sub-regional office of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) of the United Nations in Egypt and the Middle East region, praised the new strategy, noting that the Ministry of International Cooperation plays a pivotal and important role in bringing together all development partners.\n\nShe also stressed that the International Fund for Agricultural Development is ready to provide all support to the Egyptian to ensure reducing the negative impact of the coronavirus on the agricultural sector.\n\nOther development partners, notably the United Nations, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), expressed their approval of Egypt\u2019s strategy and their commitment to support the country in its fight against the global pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe EBRD is working urgently across Egypt to deliver our \u20ac1 billion global solidarity package to companies and banks that are suffering from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d Dr. Heike Harmgart, Managing Director of EBRD for its southern and eastern Mediterranean (SEMED) region, said, \u201cWe already working with existing clients across Egypt to understand their needs and support them with working capital, trade finance as well as taking an enabling view to re-scheduling if existing loans.\u201d\n\nRe-imagining the Next Normal\n\nEconomists and experts around the world are currently debating new policies to confront the world\u2019s future challenges. In a recent article by the Economist, it was noted that countries are now trying new radical economic policies to counter COVID-19. \u201cThe rules of the game have been moving in one direction for centuries. Another radical change is looming,\u201d it was mentioned.\n\nFor that reason, Egypt is working to create a new vision that will focus on three pillars: \u2018People at the Core\u2019, \u2018Projects in Action\u2019 and \u2018Purpose as the Driver\u2019.\n\nIt is a strategy that does not just target development-minded people, but for those with an interest in human development.\n\nIt is not just to sell or communicate with other partners and people, but to build together and include everyone.\n\n\u201cThrough our New Global Partnerships Framework and communication framework, the Ministry of International Cooperation aims to ensure that COVID-19 does not derail us from pushing forward with the SDG agenda. It is an innovative means to transparently showcase projects with purpose and their impact on people to boost inclusive growth as a means to promote SDGs and bolster credibility,\u201d Al Mashat stated.\n\nFor the first pillar, Egypt is committed to improving the Egyptian peoples lives by identifying existing gaps and providing multi \u2013 sectoral assistance through public private partnerships that push Egyptians towards realizing their full potential.\n\nAs for the second pillar, the Minister highlighted that projects have been implemented across multiple sectors including in education, transportation, water desalination, renewable energy, entrepreneurship, and women empowerment.\n\nFor the third pillar, the Minister referred to partnerships with purpose as key drivers to generate sustained and inclusive growth in a rapidly changing world.\n\nPROTECT, PROVIDE, AND PROGRESS\n\nEgypt\u2019s response in COVID-19 fight stresses on the importance of protecting the population from the virus, providing easier access to credit to help households smooth consumption and liquidity for firms to survive the disruption, and pushing progress by expediting structural reforms through and beyond COVID-19.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t win a football game only by defending,\u201d WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \u201cTo win, we need to attack the virus with aggressive and targeted tactics.\u201d\n\nTo ensure that the country is preparing for the future and that sustainable development is at the core, a clear strategy was outlined to ensure that each goal is given enough attention and focus.\n\nGOAL 8: DECENT WORK AND ECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nTo mitigate impact on an un-organized labor force, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefits will be provided, as well as prioritizing the transition from an informal to a formal sector.\n\nA new debt relief initiative for individuals at risk of default has also been announced that will waive marginal interest on debt under EGP 1 million if customers make a 50 percent payment.\n\nThe preferential interest rate on loans to SMEs, industry, tourism and housing for low-income and middle-class families has been reduced, and the regulations issued last year requiring banks to obtain detailed information of borrowers have been relaxed.\n\nGOAL 10: REDUCE INEQUALITIES\n\nTo reduce inequality, the Minister highlighted 60,000 households were added to Takaful and Karama Program. An additional 100,000 will be added as the budget will increase to 19.3 Billion EGP compared to 18.5 billion EGP.\n\nA one-off monetary compensation (500 EGP) offered to informal workers registered at the database of the Ministry of Manpower through post offices. Registration had been done for approximately one million individuals working in construction, agriculture, fishing, plumbing.\n\nGOAL 5: GENDER EQUALITY\n\nThe government also increased payments to women community leaders in rural areas from EGP 350 to EGP 900 per month to ensure gender equity.\n\nGOAL 4: QUALITY EDUCATION\n\nEgypt launched a new digital library available for free to every Egyptian student with learning material (digital objects) extracted from EKB and sorted out\/assembled for G1-G12 students in both Arabic and English.\n\nIn a parallel action, the Ministry of Education and Technical Education (MOETE) decided to deploy a customized version of the Edmodo Learning Management System for around 55,000 schools and train teachers to create their own virtual classrooms and invite their own students (and possibly their parents as well).\n\nGOAL 3: GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING\n\nAlternative mechanisms for testing patients were identified through the establishment of 27 laboratories across the country and additional 4 university laboratories, as well as scaling up the infection prevention and control (IPC) program with the WHO to prevent transmission and ensure patients & health workers are protected.\n\nIt also aims to expand capacity to conduct up to 200,000 tests within two weeks and setting up eight isolation hospitals with capacity of 2000 beds with 1000 ICU beds, as well as 400 ventilators and setting field hospitals for the admission of mild and asymptotic cases.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter","tests":"['200,000 tests']","ventilators":"['400 ventilators']","beds":"['1000 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Brendan McDermid | Reuters\n\nThe world is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, and some countries are reeling more than others. But Germany seems to be taking the epidemic in its stride with a high number of cases but a low number of deaths, thanks to a number of factors. In Europe, while Italy and Spain are the worst hit countries with over 100,000 cases each, as of Friday, Germany has recorded 84,794 confirmed cases but has witnessed just 1,107 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The low mortality rate in Germany, at just over 1%, is far below its neighboring European countries, and this has been put down to Germany's decision to implement widespread testing of people suspected of having the virus, as opposed to Italy or the U.K.'s decision to only test symptomatic cases. Karl Lauterbach, a professor of health economics and epidemiology at the University of Cologne, and a politician in the Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Germany, told CNBC that Germany's less severe experience of the pandemic so far was down to a handful of factors. \"I think so far we've been lucky because we were hit by the wave of new infections later than many other European countries, for example Italy, Spain and France,\" he told CNBC Thursday.\n\n\"So we had a minor but important delay in the wave of infections coming to Germany. Secondly, the first people that got infected in Germany tended to be younger than the average of the population ... so we were hit later and with younger patients initially.\" Lauterbach noted that a third factor that helped Germany was a slow increase in the number of infections, allowing those patients to be treated at the country's top medical institutions, including some of the country's best university hospitals (including those in Bonn, Dusseldorf, Aachen and Cologne) in the Heinsberg region where there was a cluster of infections at the start of the outbreak. \"Number four, all things considered, the German health-care system and hospital system has been modernized by the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats over the last 20 years ... this meant we had more hospital beds, more ventilators, more ICU (Intensive Care Units) beds and more hospital doctors, roughly speaking, than any other comparable country in Europe ... So our system is in a reasonable shape for such an epidemic.\"\n\nSuppression strategy\n\nWhile almost all European countries have introduced lockdowns to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, fatality rates have differed wildly. The mortality rate in Italy around the end of March stood at 11%, for example. Germany's rate is comparable with South Korea, a country that has also attracted plaudits for its management of the coronavirus crisis with extensive testing, contact tracing and digital surveillance of its citizens. Germany's lockdown, alongside a rigorous testing regime, has also helped, Lauterbach said. While countries like the U.K. now have to build a diagnostics industry from scratch, Germany already had one built around the multinational might of Roche. The country reportedly has the capacity to carry out up to 500,000 tests a week, whereas the U.K. can currently only manage just over 10,000 a day.","tests":"['500,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

This is despite other countries looking to Germany because of its comparatively high testing rate and relatively low death rate from Covid-19 of under 1%.\n\nAs the British government has struggled to tackle a testing shortfall, Germany has been repeatedly named as an example to follow in recent days, but a confidential scientific study commissioned by the government and recently leaked to German media showed that if it wanted to avoid a mass outbreak of the coronavirus, the country would have to greatly increase its testing capacity.\n\nEver since the government\u2019s introduction of a strict lockdown, including closing the country\u2019s borders and shutting down schools and nurseries, the scientists said around a million people in Germany \u2013 which has a population of just under 83 million \u2013 were likely to become infected, and around 12,000 would die. That outlook, however, was based on an increase in testing to 100,000 a day and within weeks to 200,000 a day.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors said that in order to carry out testing in the most efficient and quickest way possible, it would also be necessary in the longer term to rely on the use of big data and location tracking via mobile phones, an issue that is controversial in Germany.\n\nLothar Wieler, the head of the government\u2019s main public health advisory body, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said that while German testing was high compared with other countries, it would have to be speeded up. \u201cWe need to increase efficiency,\u201d he said, adding that he welcomed the news that the use of quicker and simpler tests, in addition to the current standard PCR \u2013 polymerase chain reaction test, which directly detects the DNA or RNA of the pathogen \u2013 would soon be available.\n\nGermany has a large network of more than 85 laboratories and a good history of detecting illness early. A nationwide network set up between doctors\u2019 practices, normally used to monitor the flu, was also used for testing for Covid-19 from February onwards, and the fact the system only detected a case on 12 March indicates that the virus was not widespread before then..\n\nThere has been huge worldwide interest in why the death rate in Germany from Covid-19 has remained much lower than many other countries. Germany\u2019s death rate is around 0.5%, compared with Italy\u2019s 9.5%, and a worldwide rate of around 4.7%.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that Germany started testing early on and has tested broadly. That way, many cases but also milder cases have been detected, and they did not generally include the elderly,\u201d Wieler said.\n\nIt has, he said, in effect distorted the figures. He warns that the situation in Germany is likely to worsen, as many more of the elderly who have so far not been so affected, are likely to get sick. \u201cWe are still at the start of the epidemic, and it is completely unclear as to how it will develop,\u201d Wieler said. \u201cBut of course the number of deaths in Germany will rise.\u201d\n\nHe has insisted there is not, as has sometimes been suspected, an \u201cunder-reporting\u201d of deaths from Covid-19 by hospitals. It would in theory be possible that some deaths were not counted as deaths from coronavirus, if the patient had an underlying health condition. But that is seldom likely to be the case, due to the sensibility towards the illness right now. Only if someone with coronavirus was killed by something unrelated to the virus, such as a car crash, would they not be included, medical authorities say.\n\nTesting laboratories across Germany report that while they have been at pains to increase their capacity, they face many obstacles. Germany\u2019s federal system has contributed to an inefficient gathering of data \u2013 including an unclear picture of how much testing has been done \u2013 and delays in testing suspected cases, delivering results or informing contact people. Germany\u2019s regional health bodies have recruited extra staff to help deal with the backlog, but say they are struggling to keep up. The RKI has recruited scouts \u2013 often medical students and trained doctors who arrived as refugees but are waiting to have their qualifications recognised \u2013 to support the system.\n\nAccredited Laboratories in Medicine (ALM), the largest association representing laboratories in Germany working on the tests, has said that testing capacity has increased significantly since the first case emerged in the country at the end of January.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working around the clock, in a shift system, including at weekends,\u201d Evangelos Kotsopoulos, head of ALM told Die Zeit newspaper. \u201cOur main bottlenecks are staff \u2013 many of whom have young children and are affected by school and nursery closures \u2013 and supplies from industry. Around the world there are only five or six big suppliers for the materials that we need.\u201d\n\nKotsopoulos said Germany should be far more focused on who it tested, to ensure those \u201cwho don\u2019t have symptoms but just want to know whether they have it or not\u201d are not tested, in favour of those such as at-risk patients for whom it is considered a necessity. \u201cIt is simply not practically possible right now to test everyone in a population of our size,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the RKI\u2019s guideline, priority should be given to testing medical workers, people with underlying health conditions showing coronavirus symptoms and those in contact with those who are infected, so as to be able to place them under quarantine.\n\nSpies, hijacks and export bans: the global battle for coronavirus equipment Read more\n\nBut many working on the testing frontline report concerns about a lack of materials and inefficiency, as well as a shortage of staff, forcing many people to work seven-day weeks.\n\n\u201cThe reagents we need are produced by just three manufacturers in Germany and they have run dry,\u201d Elisabeth Koerber-Kr\u00f6ll from the district medical faculty in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, south-west Germany, one of the hardest hit regions told broadcaster SWR.\n\nIncreasing emphasis is also being put on antibody tests, as well as antigen tests, as a more efficient way of managing the spread of the virus, in addition to self-testing, although many are sceptical that that this is reliable enough.","tests":"['200,000 tests', '500,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}
{"country":"Germany","publish_date":null,"url":"https:\/\/time.com\/5812555\/germany-coronavirus-deaths\/","title":"Why Is Germany's Coronavirus Death Rate So Low?","text":"With more than 63,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of March 30, Germany is one of the countries worst-affected by the pandemic, according to official statistics.\n\nBut only 560 people known to be suffering from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus have died there, putting Germany\u2019s case fatality rate at just 0.9%. That gives Germany one of the lowest rates in the world, making it an outlier compared to places like Italy, where 11.0% of confirmed patients have died from the disease, and even the U.S., which has a rate of 1.8%.\n\nAccording to experts, Germany\u2019s case fatality rate is so low due to its widespread testing. \u201cIn some countries only very symptomatic cases are tested (e.g. in Italy) and in others a broader testing strategy is done (e.g. in Germany),\u201d writes Dr. Dietrich Rothenbacher, the director of the Institute for Epidemiology at Ulm University in Germany, in an email to TIME. That means that while Germany is currently the country with the fifth-most infections in the world, chances are that it has fewer unreported cases than many other countries, where testing is harder to come by.\n\n\u201cBetween countries there are several reasons why the death rate might vary, but they\u2019re very small compared to the impact of how many people get tested,\u201d says Dr. Liam Smeeth, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cGermany very rapidly rolled out testing to a very large number of people, relative to the population.\u201d\n\nAs of March 15, Germany was behind only the UAE, South Korea and Australia as the country to have administered the most tests in the world per capita, at an estimated 2,023 per million people. (In South Korea, the only of these countries where the pandemic is at a similarly advanced stage to Germany, the case fatality rate stands at around 1.6%.) On March 20, Lothar Wieler, the president of the Robert Koch Institute\u2014Germany\u2019s main public health body\u2014said German laboratories are now able to conduct some 160,000 tests per week, about as many as they performed in the entire two months to March 15.\n\nKeep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.\n\nBack in January, Germany became one of the first countries to develop a reliable method for testing for COVID-19. Unburdened by a restrictive central regulatory body, since healthcare is administered at the state level in Germany, private companies moved quickly to mass produce those tests, meaning they could be rolled out rapidly to the population. At least 1.4 million of the tests distributed worldwide by the World Health Organization by the end of February were produced by one German company based in Berlin.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration stalled. It took until early March to allow some large companies to manufacture their own tests, leading to a shortage.\n\n\u201cBecause Germany rolled testing out so quickly as the epidemic was growing, it meant they were selectively more likely to identify milder cases,\u201d Smeeth tells TIME. Countries without such capabilities were forced to prioritize testing severe cases while leaving mild cases undiagnosed and therefore not included in the official numbers. \u201cThe more cases you ascertain, the death rate is going to go down,\u201d Smeeth says.\n\nEven though Germany and Italy\u2019s populations have similar average ages\u2014they\u2019re the two most elderly nations in the European Union\u2014the median age of Germany\u2019s population known to be infected by COVID-19 is lower: 46 as opposed to Italy\u2019s 63. Smeeth says the lower average age is likely to just be a side effect of widespread testing. \u201cIf you are testing more people, then you will get a much younger age distribution of positive cases,\u201d Smeeth says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the true age distribution of the virus is radically different between the two countries.\u201d\n\nGermany also has a high number of intensive care beds, meaning its hospitals have so far not been overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients in the same way some hospitals in Northern Italy have. According to a paper published in 2012, Germany had 29.2 critical care beds per 100,000 people\u2014more than double Italy\u2019s 12.5. (In the U.S., it\u2019s even higher, at 34.2.) And these beds are currently only 70-80% occupied, according to Germany\u2019s Deutsche Krankenhausgesellschaft (DKG), an umbrella group of hospital operators. \u201cThis means that there is for now sufficient capacity for seriously ill coronavirus patients,\u201d the DKG says on its website.\n\nBut Germany\u2019s comparatively low death toll will not last, even if the ratio does. COVID-19 can leave patients critically ill for weeks before killing them, and the country is at an earlier stage than Italy in terms of transmission of the disease.\n\n\u201cWe in Germany are in an early phase of the pandemic,\u201d Rothenbacher says. \u201cFatality numbers always have a lag-time\u2014in two to three weeks the numbers may look different.\u201d\n\nPlease send any tips, leads, and stories to virus@time.com.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.

In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nFederalism is useful for creating a dynamic business environment between different regions, but it can make it hard for an entire country to move in sync.\n\nI don\u2019t have to wait to get a call from the health minister before I can go ahead with a test.

It continues to see an uptick in cases and deaths.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWith a combination of widespread testing and a robust healthcare system, Germany has provided a potential template for how countries can adapt to the coronavirus threat and blunt its impact.\n\nHere's how Germany turned itself around as one of the European countries with the highest number of COVID-19 cases to having one of the lowest mortality rates of COVID-19 worldwide.\n\nJanuary: Germany's unconcern with coronavirus\n\nIn January, when COVID-19 was ravaging China, Germany still regarded the illness as a far-off, and likely minor, threat. In late January, German Health Minister Jens Spahn said that COVID-19 posed a very low health risk.\n\nBut it took just a few days for signs of trouble to erupt. Germany had discovered its first few COVID-19 cases by January 27, but thought they were little more than local threats that could be easily managed.\n\nGermany wasn't the only country with this reaction. On January 22, US President Donald Trump was asked whether he was worried about the coronavirus outbreak. \"It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control,\" Trump said. \"It's going to be just fine.\"\n\nAt the time, Germany and the US seemed to be on the same page.\n\nFebruary: Germany has one of the highest infection rates in the world\n\nOver the course of February, the situation had changed dramatically in Germany.\n\nThe coronavirus threat was increasing by the day and with 48 confirmed cases by February 28, Germany had the second-highest number of cases in Europe behind Italy's 644 cases. It was also just behind the 60 cases confirmed in the US.\n\nThat seemed to be the point at which Germany and the US started to diverge in their response to COVID-19. Just two days prior, on February 26, Trump said that the US coronavirus threat was \"going down, not up.\" The next day, he said the threat would, \"like a miracle,\" evaporate.\n\nBut Germany sprung into action. By the time Trump made his comments, Germany was already taking action to address the coronavirus threat.\n\nLate February and early March: Germany's forceful and rapid response\n\nIn late February, the country extended school and daycare facility closures and required anyone who had contact with confirmed cases to remain in isolation for 14 days. Even in unconfirmed cases \u2014 those who had been near someone with coronavirus-like symptoms \u2014 were told to self-isolate.\n\nMeanwhile, the government said that it would limit outside travel into the country and begin acquiring protective medical equipment to prepare for the COVID-19 fight. Along the way, despite an inability to get rapid test results, Germany was ramping up its testing efforts.\n\n\"Germany was able to react to the situation unfolding in China in January and have testing established by mid-February,\" said epidemiology professor at Yale School of Public Health Nathan Grubaugh. \"They could do this in part because Germany doesn't have a centralized diagnostic system so labs around the country were free to establish tests.\" In fact, as of April 2, private labs in Germany have helped the country test 1 million people for COVID-19.\n\nGermany was one of the first countries to develop a testing system for COVID-19. It's early access to reliable tests for COVID-19 meant that Germany could \"get a much better handle on who was infected, isolate contacts, and treat those who need care,\" Jennifer Kates, the senior vice president and global health and HIV policy director at the Kaiser Family Foundation said.\n\nMarch 9-10: The first deaths\n\nDespite widespread testing efforts, the German coronavirus outbreak continued. By March 9, Germany had approximately 1,200 cases and had recorded its first two deaths. The same day, the US had accumulated 950 cases and 28 deaths.\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel and her administration told Germany that they would need to do \"everything possible\" to slow the coronavirus spread and save lives. She announced that gatherings of more than 1,000 people would be shut down. This was 7 days before Trump recommended social distancing measures in the US based on CDC guidelines.\n\nBut perhaps what has contributed to Germany's low death rate most is an ace up its sleeve that many other countries can't match: An extremely high bed-to-person ratio. According to data from HealthSystemTracker, Germany has 8.1 hospital beds per 1,000 people and 6.1 ICU beds per 1,000 people. Italy has 3.2 hospital beds per 1,000 and 2.6 ICU beds per 1,000. The US has 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 and 2.4 ICU beds per 1,000 people.\n\n\"Germany hospital capacity surpasses that of many other countries,\" Kates said. It's been a key factor in saving lives and not overwhelming a strained healthcare system.\n\nMarch 17: A bigger risk \u2014 and problems testing\n\nOn March 17, the Robert Koch Institute, which monitors public health across the country, changed COVID-19's health risk to \"high\" in Germany.\n\nThe German government said that because of a lag of about three to four days between testing and results, it believed the real number of cases was higher than the recorded 7,000, or so. Germany quickly expanded the number of COVID-19 beds by 1,000 to accommodate extra needs.\n\nIn the ensuing days, more curfews and quarantines went into effect. Social distancing, a core component in any country's battle with COVID-19, was further tightened as schools, daycare facilities, and other gathering limitations were extended. At the right time, Germany responded forcefully, experts said.\n\n\"The factors [in Germany's success] have not been in place in other settings,\" Kates said. \"The US has largely bungled its testing effort and Italy's hospitals have been overwhelmed. These are very hard barriers to overcome once countries are at this point.\"\n\nBut Germany wasn't done.\n\nMarch 22: A widespread crackdown\n\nBy March 22, Germany's cases hovered at around 25,000, but deaths were just 86 \u2014 a fatality rate of approximately 0.3% that easily outpaced China, Italy, and nearly every other country around the world.\n\nThat day, the German government announced that people would need to remain six feet apart, and gatherings of more than two people were forbidden. Germans were also asked to stay home, unless necessary.\n\nIt was a move made just a day after Italy announced similar national restrictions on movement and non-essential business activity. But by then, the differences between Germany and Italy were stark: Italy reached more than 59,000 cases that day and nearly 5,500 deaths.\n\nIn the US, the coronavirus battle was ramping up. On March 22, the US 140 deaths that day and 557 cumulative fatalities. A mortality rate of 1.2%. This is partly due to the country's slow roll out of tests early on, Grubaugh said.\n\nLate March into April: Questions abound\n\nStatistics indicate that Germany is in a far better place than many of the other developed countries worldwide. And testing may be central to its success.\n\nLate last month, Germany said that it could conduct 160,000 tests each week, and has been able to test more than 2,000 per million people. It's now using rapid testing to identify patients within hours, and it's not letting up.\n\n\"It's becoming clear that the countries that rolled out rapid wide-scale testing are the ones that are also controlling the virus better,\" Grubaugh said.\n\n\"If countries that have yet to see surging cases can implement early widespread testing, isolation of those infected and contact tracing, coupled with shoring up their health system capacity, they can see success,\" Kates said.\n\nGermany hit all the right marks. But the fight remains.\n\nExperts cautioned that Germany may not have reached its peak. The country added about 4,000 new cases on March 28. On March 30 cases were up 4,600 to a cumulative total of 61,913.\n\nMeanwhile, deaths are increasing. On March 29, Germany recorded 66 deaths due to COVID-19. That figure increased 128 on March 30. Germany's death rate is now 1.2% -- still lower compared to many other parts of the world.\n\nIt's unclear what might be happening in Germany and whether the worst is behind the country.

Coupled with Germany\u2019s large number of intensive care beds and its early social distancing measures, it could explain one of the most interesting puzzles of the COVID-19 pandemic: Why are people with the virus in Germany currently dying at much lower rates than in neighboring countries?\n\nThe numbers are remarkable: As confirmed cases in Germany passed 71,000, the death toll Wednesday was 775, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. In contrast, Italy has reported almost 106,000 infections and more than 12,400 deaths, while Spain has more than 102,000 cases with over 9,000 deaths.\n\nFrance has four times as many virus deaths as Germany and Britain has twice as many, even though both countries have fewer reported infections.\n\nThere may be many factors at play, but experts said early on that fast and widespread testing gave Germany an edge.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,\u201d said virologist Dr. Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the new virus at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital \u2014 established over 300 years ago to treat plague victims.\n\nHe estimated that Germany is now capable of conducting up to 500,000 tests a week.\n\nSpain, meanwhile, tests between 105,000 and 140,000 people each week, about 20% to 30% what Germany is capable of. Italy did around 200,000 tests over the past week, but that reflects a significant recent ramp-up.\n\nEarly access to the test from Drosten\u2019s team is only part of the reason for Germany\u2019s head start. Before the country even registered its first case, authorities agreed the tests would be covered by its universal insurance system, and be available to everyone with symptoms and either recent travel to virus hotspots or close contact with a confirmed case.\n\nStill, Germany may not be as much of an anomaly as it seems. The fact that Spain and Italy \u2014 which have seen much more intense outbreaks \u2014 are doing fewer tests indicates they are missing many mild or asymptomatic cases. That makes their fatality rates look worse than they are. But Germany, too, is likely missing cases, and experts say that all figures worldwide undercount the extent of the pandemic.\n\nLimited testing also means the true spread of the virus is hidden in those countries \u2014 further fueling the outbreak.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to to death.\n\nEnsuring those severely ill patients can be treated properly is key to managing the outbreak \u2014 and preventing deaths.\n\nAnd there again, Germany has an advantage.\n\nItaly had 8.6 intensive care unit beds per 100,000 people before the outbreak, according to the Organization for Cooperation and Economic Development. By comparison, Germany\u2019s most recent available figure is 33.9 per 100,000, or about 28,000 in total, a number the government wants to double.\n\n\u201cWe are well prepared today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,\u201d said Dr. Uwe Janssens, who heads Germany\u2019s Interdisciplinary Association for Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine.\n\nHospitals in the hardest-hit areas of Italy, are now buckling under the weight of treating so many ill patients at once, contributing the country\u2019s death toll \u2014 the highest in the world.\n\nIn the rare position of having beds to spare, German hospitals have taken in dozens of patients from Italy and France. While that will allow German doctors and nurses to learn how to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients, it also reflects a remarkable confidence in the country\u2019s ability to manage its outbreak at a time when many others are shutting their borders.\n\nThe Robert Koch Institute, Germany\u2019s disease control center, has suggested that strong measures imposed almost three weeks ago, including closing schools and restaurants, and later barring more than two people from gathering outside, seem to have slowed the rate of new infections.\n\nExperts have bemoaned that many countries took similar steps too late.\n\nScientists advising the British government say major social distancing measures are necessary before there are 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people. According to the, albeit imperfect, data available, Italy imposed its lockdown four days after hitting that threshold but Germany\u2019s came a week before that level was reached.\n\nOfficials stress Germany is still in an early stage of its outbreak. But Dr. Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine at Imperial College London, said countries that intervene early with aggressive measures should theoretically be able to avoid the tsunami of cases seen in Italy and Spain.\n\n\u201cWe were lucky to have had a long time to prepare,\u201d said Dr. Susanne Herold, a specialist for lung infections at the university hospital in Giessen. For weeks, her staff has been installing new ICU beds, training in the use of ventilators and planning for an emergency scenario.\n\nAmid the cautious optimism, there are those who warn against complacency.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 who is herself in isolation after her doctor tested positive \u2014 has resisted calls to loosen the lockdown. A top government medical adviser, Lothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute, said he wouldn\u2019t rule out Germany\u2019s health system reaching its limit, too.\n\n\u201cThis is still the calm before the storm,\u201d said Health Minister Jens Spahn.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Nicole Winfield in Rome, Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin and Maria Cheng in London contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https:\/\/apnews.com\/VirusOutbreak and https:\/\/apnews.com\/UnderstandingtheOutbreak","tests":"['200,000 tests', '500,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Although the figure is far lower than numbers seen in the worst days in countries like Italy and Spain, where daily death tolls have frequently surpassed 800 recently, it was the sharpest increase yet in Turkey.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Koca revealed for the first time the nature of the spread of the outbreak across Turkey, showing that 60 percent of cases had been reported in Istanbul, the country's commercial hub, which accounts for a fifth of Turkey's population.\n\nMehmet Ceyhan, chairman of Turkey's Infectious Diseases Association, warned that the country could see its number of infections outstrip others.\n\n\"If we go at the current rate, our number of cases will be 300,000 in 10 days,\" he said.\n\nHowever, closing down public spaces, restricting travel between cities and ensuring people stay at home would avoid such a dramatic scenario.\n\n\"I look at the measures that have been implemented, and our people have begun to adapt a little better,\" Ceyhan said.\n\n\"If we comply with the measures in the same way, we may see a fall in the rate of increase.\"\n\nShortages\n\nDespite winning praise for its early adoption of restrictions such as border closures, suspending air travel and quarantining those aged over 65, the government has faced criticism over the relatively low number of tests carried out.\n\nTurkey had conducted just under 107,000 tests and only reached a target of carrying out 10,000 a day on Monday.\n\nThis compares with more than half a million tests carried out in Italy.\n\nProfessional medical groups have highlighted a shortfall in the equipment, beds and health staff needed to deal with larger numbers of coronavirus patients.\n\n\"It is evident that hospitals in the city have not prepared adequately in the two and a half months since this deadly virus first came into the spotlight,\" the Istanbul Chamber of Physicians said in a statement.\n\nAs well as a shortage of protective gear such as masks and gloves, the chamber also criticised a lack of organisation and improper testing of health workers, noting that more than 100 staff in Istanbul hospitals had tested positive.\n\nAccording to the government, more than 600 healthcare personnel have been infected across Turkey.\n\n\"That's worrying,\" said Kizil. \"The answer to the question of whether we will be like Italy will be determined by how ready our healthcare system is for the high number of cases that appear on the horizon.\"\n\nCalls for quarantine\n\nAnkara has resisted calls for a full lockdown, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan calling for businesses to stay open and keep the economy's \"wheels turning\".\n\nHowever, the president said Turkey would step up measures if the outbreak continued spreading.\n\nThe government has urged people to stay at home; closed schools, cafes and bars; restricted domestic travel; halted international flights; and suspended sporting events and religious gatherings.\n\nThe presidency declined to comment on the efficiency of its measures, but Koca on Wednesday defended the government's response and said the health ministry aimed to implement 30,000 tests daily within 10 days.\n\n\"We have done everything to create a fighting environment in unity and togetherness from the beginning,\" he said.\n\n\"We plan to enhance our resources as much as possible and we are planning what to do in situations, such as plan B, plan C, plan D.\"\n\nSenol, the infectious disease specialist, called for more robust testing and isolation policies as well as greater transparency and information sharing.\n\nTurkey should prevent people from mixing outside their homes, Kizil said.\n\n\"Turkey is doing the exact opposite of what must be done. This outbreak is in the late stages and we can't be satisfied with early-stage measures like washing hands and practicing social distancing. We need quarantine.\"","tests":"['107,000 tests', '30,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The lack of any identified cases provoked suspicion because if the test is negative, there was no other way to prove that the test might be positive,\u201d said Dr. Ergin Ko\u00e7y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, a paediatric cardiothoracic surgeon and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburg\u2019s School of Medicine.\n\nA source at a privately owned hospital in Istanbul told Ahval that the government was controlling the distribution of kits and not allowing hospitals to independently order alternatives.\n\nTurkey has said its own virus detection kits are the fastest and most accurate in the world. While most detection kits generally yield results in around 24 hours, the Turkish government said its kits - produced in Turkey by a private company and funded by the state - can produce results in 90 minutes.\n\nDespite the Health Ministry\u2019s claims that Turkish coronavirus detection kits have been exported to several countries, including the United States, Ko\u00e7y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said that - to his knowledge - there was not a single institution or lab in that country using the tests.\n\nKo\u00e7y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m also said that the Turkish government\u2019s censorship of information was preventing people receiving reliable information on the coronavirus and was a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nTurkey is the world\u2019s biggest jailer of journalists and has threatened to take legal action against social media users or journalists who criticise its coronavirus detection approach, said Ko\u00e7y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m.\n\n\u201cTurkey has an ongoing economic crisis and relies on tourism revenue. If tourists are going to stop visiting Turkey, this year the economy might collapse. This could also be one of the reasons for not reporting a positive case for such a long period,\u201d said Ko\u00e7y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m.\n\nAfter weeks of growing concerns among Turks about the growing threat posed by the virus and less than two days after the first case was reported in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan called a cabinet meeting on Thursday to discuss additional measures against the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, an aide to Erdo\u011fan used a thermal camera to check people for fever who met the president during a visit to parliament on Wednesday, Reuters said.\n\nTurkish authorities took early precautions such as thermal screening at airports, closing the border with Iran, and suspending air travel to China, Iran, Italy, and South Korea. But the lack of previously identified cases triggered suspicion among many, because Turkey is a major tourism destination and regional transit hub, and shares a border with Iran, one of the countries hit hardest by the virus.\n\nWhen Health Minister Fahrettin Koca did announce on Wednesday that Turkey\u2019s first coronavirus patient had been identified, he resisted responding to questions by the media by claiming that this would violate the patient's privacy.\n\nAfter Wednesday\u2019s announcement, the government ramped up further measures to control the spread of the virus, banning all public gatherings at schools and indefinitely cancelling leave for military personnel. The municipality in Istanbul, where the first case was detected, has cancelled all shows at city theatres, banned visits to museums, and halted vocational courses.\n\nThe tense relations and a lack of cooperation between the government and the Turkish Medical Association (TMA) - an independent medical and health professional association that aims to protect and promote public health in Turkey - could also be a problematic factor in informing the public about the virus, wrote Ko\u00e7y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m.\n\n\u201cDespite their efforts to collaborate during the coronavirus outbreak, TMA reports that there has not been any government response yet,\u201d he said.\n\nKo\u00e7y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m said trust in government institutions was essential for advising the public and disseminating vital information. \u201cTurkish citizens will have to contend with these problems [of trust] as they navigate the coronavirus crisis,\u201d he said.","tests":"['2,500 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

On the other hand, the number is 11.6 for France, 6.6 for the UK and below five in Portugal.\n\nIn South Korea, the critical bed number per 100,000 is 10.6 while Japan has 9.7 and China has 3.6.\n\nIn Europe, detected cases have already passed 50,000 which also increased the number of people in critical condition.\n\nDoctor number\n\nDoctors and healthcare workers take on the most critical roles in fighting against the outbreak. At this time, in many countries, they work day and night with great effort and self-sacrifice.\n\nThe number of doctors varies from country to country. Austria has the most doctors in proportion to its population, it has 5.2 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report for 2018.\n\nGermany has also a good score in this respect by having 4.3 doctors per 1,000 people, while Italy has four.\n\nWhen it comes to Turkey, despite having the most critical care infrastructure in the world, the number of doctors per inhabitant is about 1.8 per 1,000. The number of healthcare workers is twice that of doctors in the country.\n\nGeneral bed capacity\n\nJapan and South Korea are the most advantageous countries in the world in terms of bed capacity in hospitals. Japan has 13.1 beds per a thousand people while South Korea has 12.3.\n\nTotal bed capacity is another important factor in the current crisis. The medium of OECD countries\u2019 bed capacity per 1,000 is 4.5, while the EU countries it is 5.1.\n\nFor the leading EU countries, such as Germany, France, and Italy, ratios are 8.0, 6.0 and 3.2, respectively.\n\nThe number of beds per 1,000 inhabitants is about 2.8 in Turkey, where public hospitals have 75 percent of the total bed capacity.\n\nSource: TRT World","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['46 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Tunisia last month accused Italy of seizing a shipment of medical alcohol bound for the north African country.\n\nThe Trump administration has been accused of the most egregious offences, including swiping shipments destined for Germany, France and Canada for its own use, and withholding or even seizing supplies destined for use in American states politically hostile to him, his oligarchic allies and the agenda of his evangelical Christian supporters.\n\nVentilators are crucial to keep alive patients so sickened by Covid-19 that they are unable to breathe on their own. The ones reportedly held up by Turkey were purchased by the Spanish regions of Navarra in the north and Castille-La Mancha east of Madrid to address one of the most deadly outbreaks of coronavirus in the world. Spain has recorded 12,418 deaths and 130,759 confirmed infections, second worldwide only to Italy.\n\nJust days earlier, Turkey shipped plane loads of medical equipment to Spain and Italy, both Nato partners. But Turkey too has begun to experience the accelerating impact of Covid-19, reporting at least 425 deaths and 20,921 cases. Medical practitioners in major cities have begun describing overwhelmed emergency rooms and intensive care wards.\n\nOn Friday, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced tightened restrictions, including requiring masks at supermarkets and barring anyone under 20 years old or over 65 from leaving their homes.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

By comparison, the US is expected to face 81,766 deaths, according to forecasts released on Sunday by IHME.\n\n\"We are expecting a foreboding few weeks for people in many parts of Europe,\" said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray. \"It seems likely the number of deaths will exceed our projections for the United States.\"\n\nThis is despite the declines in deaths that are now occurring in Italy and Spain.\n\nThe death toll in many countries is compounded by demand for hospital resources well in excess of what is available. For example, peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds needed compared to 17,765 available, 24,544 ICU beds compared to 799 ICU beds available, and 20,862 ventilators needed (with data currently unavailable on ventilators available).\n\nToday's announcement on Europe finds that most regions of Italy and Spain have passed their peaks in the number of deaths, while other nations are approaching their peaks and still others facing peak mortality later in April.\n\nCountries that are about to peak or are quickly approaching peak in this wave of the epidemic include The Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, and Luxembourg. The Czech Republic and Romania are midway through their expected trajectories. Other nations including the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, and Greece are still early in their trajectories and face fast-rising death tolls through their peaks in the second and third weeks of April.\n\n\"It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,\" Murray said. \"Those nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation's trajectory will change \u2013 and dramatically for the worse \u2013 if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.\"\n\nMurray cautioned that easing these precautions too soon during the first wave of the pandemic could lead to new rounds of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. He defines the end of this \"wave\" as a ratio of 0.3 deaths per 1 million people. IHME's projections assume that social distancing measures, if not currently implemented, will be implemented within one week.\n\n\"To decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass produced, and distributed widely,\" Murray said.\n\nIHME started making projections of the pandemic's impact in the United States state-by-state on March 26. Today's announcement is the first set of predictions for European nations and is based on modeling the peak in death rates and hospital usage in Wuhan City in China, where the virus was first discovered, as well as data from seven European locations that have peaked, including Madrid, Spain; Castile-La Mancha, Spain; Tuscany, Italy; Emilia-Romagna, Italy; Liguria, Italy; Piedmont, Italy; and Lombardy, Italy.\n\nOf these eight locations that have reached the peak regarding daily deaths, only one, Wuhan, has currently brought new cases to nearly zero.\n\nThe analysis is based on an extensive range of information and data sources, including:\n\nLocal governments, national governments, and the World Health Organization\n\nGovernment declarations on implementation of social distancing policies\n\nAge-specific death rate data from China , Italy , South Korea , and the US\n\nHere are some country-specific findings from IHME's latest forecasting:\n\nITALY : The first wave of the pandemic has peaked in Italy , and peak resource use for ICU beds and ventilators was on March 28 .

Its large health research and disease-tracing machinery, honed by years of coping with its HIV epidemic, has swung into action, driving testing and surveillance.\n\nTo date, it has tested more than 47,000 people, although experts and health officials say that much more needs to be done to try and isolate infected individuals. Head of the Medical Research Council Glenda Gray told Quartz Africa that the country should be testing about 25,000 people a day. \u201cWe\u2019re far behind.\u201d\n\nMuch of the concern about the impact of coronavirus on Sub Saharan Africa has centered around what the WHO has described as the region\u2019s \u201cfragile health systems\u201d. But in South Africa, the continent\u2019s most advanced economy but also one of the most unequal in the world, the vast majority of cases have been tested by private laboratories, as opposed to state facilities.\n\nSouth Africa has a two-tiered healthcare system, with wealthier individuals opting for private healthcare and poorer residents reliant on state services. The first cases of Covid-19 were reported in people returning from other countries, and people in this income bracket in South Africa tend to have medical aid and visit private rather than public healthcare facilities.\n\nIn the face of increasing local transmission\u2014and the threat of Covid-19 spreading to the majority of the country, who are not able to afford private healthcare or testing\u2014the National Health Laboratory Service has said that by the end of April, it will be able to process approximately 36,000 tests in 24 hours.\n\nBut other countries in the region do not have these sorts of resources. On April 2, Zimbabwe had tested only 316 people for the virus, and had nine positive cases and one death. It declared a national lockdown on Mar. 29. In Namibia, whose testing is done locally and in South Africa, there have been 306 tests, and 11 confirmed Covid-19 cases.\n\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control says that testing capacity at its laboratories has increased to 1,500 tests a day, but a recent report found that by Mar. 22 Nigeria had only tested 152 people. There are currently 190 cases in the country, although experts fear that there are many more.\n\nDr Matshidiso Moeti, Africa regional director of WHO, told a press briefing on Thursday. A serious challenge for many countries in the region is the availability of testing kits.\n\nAt the moment, many test kits are being donated to African countries from philanthropic individuals, such as Alibaba\u2019s Jack Ma, and overseas governments; or distributed by the African Union.\n\nIn its initial stages, the spread of the pandemic seemed to have by-passed many African countries. Now that the virus is spreading locally, countries\u2019 struggling healthcare systems are already showing their weaknesses\u2014and that is before the number of severely sick people begins to multiply.\n\nSign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox","tests":"['306 tests', '1,500 tests', '36,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

In the windswept dunes of Cape Town\u2019s Khayelitsha township, centers have been erected where residents are screened and those deemed at risk are tested.\n\nWhile most people who become infected have mild or moderate symptoms, the disease can be particularly dangerous for older people and those with existing health problems, such as those whose immune systems are weakened or who have lung issues. That means many in South Africa \u2014 with world\u2019s largest number of people with HIV, more than 8 million, and one of the world\u2019s highest levels of TB, which affects the lungs \u2014 are at high risk of getting more severe cases of the disease.\n\n\u201cSocial distancing is almost impossible when a large family lives in a one-room shack. Frequent hand-washing is not practical when a hundred families share one tap,\u201d said Denis Chopera, executive manager of the Sub-Saharan African Network for TB\/HIV Research Excellence.\n\n\u201cThese are areas where there are high concentrations of people with HIV and TB who are at risk for severe symptoms. These are areas that can quickly become hot spots,\u201d said Chopera, a virologist based in Durban.\n\nBut years of fighting those scourges has endowed South Africa with a network of testing sites and laboratories in diverse communities across the country that may help it cope, say experts.\n\n\u201cWe have testing infrastructure, testing history and expertise that is unprecedented in the world,\u201d said Francois Venter, deputy director of the Reproductive Health Institute at the University of Witswatersrand. \u201cIt is an opportunity that we cannot afford to squander.\u201d\n\nThe country imposed a three-week lockdown March 27 that bought it some time, said Venter.\n\n\u201cNow is the time to test and track. We must get out into the community and find out where the hot spots are,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cWith testing we can strategically focus our resources.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa was one of only two countries in Africa that could test for the new coronavirus when it began its global spread in January. Now at least 43 of the continent\u2019s 54 countries can, but many have limited capacity.\n\nWidespread testing has even been a challenge in North America and Europe, where some countries with large outbreaks resorted to only testing patients who are hospitalized.\n\nCurrently able to conduct 5,000 tests per day, South Africa will increase its capacity to more than 30,000 per day by the end of the April, according to the National Health Laboratory Service.\n\nThat would make its capacity among the best in Africa and comparable to many countries in the developed world, say health experts.\n\nAt first in South Africa, COVID-19 appeared to be a disease of the rich, as the first few hundred cases were virtually all people who had traveled to Italy and France and who could afford to go to private clinics.\n\nBut as local transmission of the virus takes hold, the public health service must take testing into the country\u2019s most vulnerable areas: the overcrowded, under-resourced townships.\n\nSouth Africa has thousands of community health workers experienced in reaching out in these areas to educate about infectious diseases as well as to screen, test and track contacts to try to contain the spread.\n\nSouth Africa is already testing by taking swabs and using conventional means.\n\nAnd it is also expecting to receive new kits that will allow rapid test results. South Africa has for several years been using a TB testing system that extracts genetic material and produces results within two hours. That system, known as GeneXpert, has developed a test for COVID-19 that was approved last month by the US Food and Drug Administration and South Africa is expecting delivery of those test kits within weeks.\n\n\u201cThis will dramatically shorten our testing time and the smaller machines can be placed in mobile vehicles, which are ideal for community testing,\u201d said Dr. Kamy Chetty, CEO of the National Health Laboratory Service.\n\nSouth African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said the country must find out \u201cwhat is happening in our densely populated areas, in particular the townships\u201d where he said health workers would \u201ccontinue to venture forth in full combat by proactively conducting wall-to-wall testing and find all COVID-19 affected people in the country.\u201d","tests":"['5,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

A machine called the GeneXpert, currently used to diagnose tuberculosis (TB), will be used by the state to test for coronavirus.\n\nMinister of Health Zweli Mkhize has expressed concern that not enough testing is being done. \u201cOur testing criteria are reactive and restrictive. This means we don\u2019t have a true picture,\u201d he has said in his daily briefing on the Covid-19 epidemic.\n\nSouth Africa had conducted over 50,000 tests by 4 April. This compares well to, say, Brazil which has conducted about the same number of tests but has a much bigger population. But our capacity is far behind Australia (nearly 300,000 tests), South Korea (over 460,000 tests) and most European countries.\n\nAlso, in the early stages of the epidemic here it was clear who to target: people with symptoms of Covid-19 who were returning from overseas. Now it is much less obvious and we risk missing outbreaks unless we can do much more testing in many more communities.\n\nThe GeneXpert, developed by an American company called Cepheid, is key to this. The smallest version of the machine is the size of a desktop computer. It takes four cartridges, where each cartridge is loaded up with sputum from a patient and chemical reagents which allow the machine to detect genetic material of TB, or now coronavirus. It takes 45 minutes to give a result.\n\nAs of 2017, South Africa had 314 of these machines. Most have four or 16 cartridges, but there are some with 48 or even 80 cartridges. 180 of the machines will be used for Covid-19.\n\nProf Bavesh Kana, director of the Centre of Excellence in Biomedical Tuberculosis Research, said the GeneXpert is a safe, fast and easy to use system.\n\nHe explained that a health worker takes a sample from the patient and puts it into the cartridge. Within the cartridge the genetic material of the coronavirus is released, but it is safe because it is a closed system.\n\n\u201cThe RNA of the virus is converted into DNA. This needs to be done because it is a DNA test. Then certain regions of the genetic material are identified during the test. If the genetic identification is made, the test will be positive,\u201d Kana explained.\n\nThe tests can be done in some of the mobile laboratories that the health department is rolling out, though electricity is needed.\n\nThe Covid-19 test chemical reagents are due to arrive in the country this month.\n\nWhile this is all good news, Cepheid has come under US-based activist organisation Treatment Action Group (not to be confused with the local Treatment Action Campaign). It has demanded that Cepheid should immediately lower the cost of its cartridges to $5 each for developing countries.\n\n\u201cBy pricing its Covid-19 test at $20 for developing countries \u2014 twice the current price of the same cartridge when used to diagnose TB \u2014 Cepheid gives the appearance of profiteering at a time when the most widespread possible use of the test could help to slow the spread of the pandemic and reduce the number of deaths in these countries,\u201d said Mark Harrington, the organisation\u2019s Executive Director.\n\nAnother concern is that using the machines for Covid-19 will impede TB testing. Asked about this Kana said: \u201cThe GeneXperts are very effective and they can run for 24 hours, if needed. It is also very early in the pandemic, and it is hard to say now, how the system will respond.\u201d\n\nBeyond the GeneXpert, laboratory capacity is also being increased. Dr Kamy Chetty, Chief Executive Officer, of the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) said they currently have six laboratories where Covid-19 tests are done.\n\nBy late April this will be increased to nine. The mobile laboratories will bring patient samples to these facilities. Most tests are still being done in the private sector.\n\nCurrently the country can do about 5,000 tests in 24 hours. Later this month it will increase to 15,000 and by the end of April to 36,000. At least that is the plan. The proof will be in the execution.\n\nMinister Mkhize is also hoping that antibody tests will be useable in South Africa soon. These can be done by nurses at a clinic or hospital, are usually much cheaper than lab tests and give results in less than 20 minutes.\n\nBut they have a shortcoming.\n\nBecause they test for antibodies, not the virus directly, a person who has been infected and recovered will test positive. A further lab test that checks directly for the virus would then need to be conducted to see if they are still infected (and infectious). Also it can take 10 to 14 days from infection for antibodies to develop.\n\nNevertheless, antibody tests, when they eventually are used, will help surveillance of the epidemic and contribute to our understanding of it in South Africa.\n\nBy Elsab\u00e9 Brits.

Before they were stopped, the country also had direct flights to Wuhan, the city where the pandemic first began.\n\nSlow off the mark\n\nMyanmar has also been slow to institute widespread testing, with only 517 people tested as of the end of March. Even this low number is a marked increase, given that Myanmar had tested less than 150 people by March 18. It was only on March 20 that the health minister announced a new policy to test for anybody with symptoms, not just recent travellers.\n\nMembers of the Myanmar Red Cross Society distributing information about COVID-19 in the western town of Rakhine [Nyunt Win\/EPA]\n\n\"To find 10 cases from 300 tests suggests that there are many more cases out there and scaling up testing should be a priority to get on top of the virus spread and guide response,\" Tatem said.\n\nThe United Nations has announced a plan to donate 50,000 testing kits to Myanmar, supplementing previous donations of 3,000 from Singapore and 5,000 from South Korea.\n\nKhin Khin Gyi, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, admitted it was possible the virus arrived in Myanmar earlier, but said a certain percentage of those cases would presumably have been \"severe\" and therefore would have come to the government's attention.\n\nJoshua Poole, country director for Catholic Relief Services Myanmar, agreed that if there were widespread cases across the country, the news would be circulating on social media. Poole also chairs the Steering Committee of the International NGO Forum in Myanmar and has sat in on virtual meetings between the WHO, UN, and Ministry of Health.\n\n\"We're having some challenges in terms of getting more tests out there. In my perspective, it seems like the government is doing everything they can. Obviously, there are some challenges, and there certainly seems to be some delays, but I'm actually quite impressed with what the ministry is able to do,\" he said in a recent interview.\n\nOthers, like independent analyst David Mathieson, are less impressed.\n\n\"The public health system in Myanmar is woefully unsuited to responding to a pandemic on this scale, so it will be hard to assess how long COVID-19 has been in the country and how many people have perished but had deaths recorded under other causes,\" he said.\n\nMathieson said the government was slow to respond due to a \"toxic mixture of incompetence, a culture of denial, and ultra-nationalist bluster.\"\n\nHealth Minister Myint Htwe set the unrealistic goal of zero cases and zero deaths, while government spokesman Zaw Htay said Myanmar was protected by its lifestyle, diet, and lack of credit cards.\n\nWhile Myanmar did begin to take action once cases were confirmed, Mathieson is worried the government lost more than a month's worth of time.\n\nReturn from Thailand\n\nTens of thousands of migrant workers returned from Thailand last week as the borders were closed, which Tatem said has \"the potential to seed outbreaks across the country if there are not local outbreaks occurring already\".\n\nThe migrants crowded across the border before boarding buses with the general population and dispersing throughout the country.\n\nKhin Khin Gyi said the government had \"planned a lot\" for the return of migrants from Thailand.\n\n\"We had social distancing at the immigration counter, a medical declaration form, we took their names and residences in the country,\" she said.\n\nMigrant workers from Myanmar began crossing the border at Mae Sot as Thailand prepared to implement emergency measures [Stringer\/Reuters]\n\nShe added that local authorities were informed of their whereabouts so they can \"watch\" returnees, and soon the government will implement community quarantine measures and violators will face legal action. \"Some people do not follow the home quarantine,\" she said.\n\nBut locals and activists working with migrants said the government response had been unsatisfactory.\n\nAlexa Bay, director of anti-trafficking group Daughters Rising, said migrant workers belatedly heard about self-isolation policies from local news.\n\n\"They have not heard anything from the government,\" she said.\n\nWahkushee Tenner, a Karen activist, said the chaotic return had put the migrants and local population at risk.\n\n\"These people are at the most risk of being infected if anyone among this big crowd is infected. It's really putting the local community at high risk where there is no test available, and most of these workers came from poor and remote areas,\" she said in a message.\n\nTenner said the government does not have the capacity to contain the virus, and criticised the military for being too \"busy bombing and killing in Rakhine State and other ethnic areas.\"\n\n\"In a global epidemic situation it would be good to see the end of offensives against ethnic people,\" she said.\n\nThose living in Myanmar's makeshift camps for people displaced by civil conflict are also bracing for a possible crisis. Human Rights Watch called the camps, which are home to an estimated 350,000 people, \"COVID-19 tinderboxes\".\n\n\"Years of conflict, neglect, and abusive policies by Myanmar's government and military have left hundreds of thousands of displaced people sitting in the path of a public health catastrophe,\" said HRW's Asia Director Brad Adams in a statement.\n\n'Knife's edge'\n\nMyanmar's poor also face the difficult choice between potentially exposing themselves to the virus, or taking an income hit they simply cannot afford.\n\n\"Many Myanmar people live on a knife's edge of livelihoods and food security,\" said Mathieson. \"Myanmar's poor will be the ones who suffer the most from any pandemic, and any extended shutdown without significant government and private food supplies and sustainability will drive many communities to desperation.\"\n\nYangon is preparing for the further spread of the coronavirus, with some worried Myanmar's healthcare system will be unable to cope [Thein Zaw\/AP Photo]\n\nEven as restaurants and bars across Yangon shut down over the weekend, taxi drivers continued calling out to the rare pedestrians on the street, offering rides.\n\nThey said they knew the risk, but felt they had no other choice. \"If I don't drive, I don't eat,\" said one.\n\nBay works with domestic workers who feel the same way.\n\n\"Some of the girls who are domestic workers think that their job is risky now, and they are worried that they come in contact with people that have the virus ... but they don't feel they can refuse because they are afraid they will be fired,\" she said.","tests":"['300 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

One 69-year-old patient, who had been undergoing treatment for stage-four cancer and tested positive for COVID-19, died on Tuesday.\n\nMyanmar Govt Cracks Down on Fake COVID-19 News\n\nThe Myanmar government is following through on its threats to punish anyone who spreads fake news about COVID-19 as authorities arrested a man on Saturday for a Facebook post.\n\n\u2013 By Zarni Mann\n\nMANDALAY\u2014The Myanmar government has begun to take legal action against people who spread \u201cfake news\u201d and rumors related to the coronavirus as authorities arrested and charged a man from Bago Region\u2019s Yaytarshay Township on Saturday.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Home Affairs, Bone Myint Moe was arrested for posting a message saying \u201cBa Ring Gone is positive\u201d in the Facebook group for Yaytarshay on Saturday evening.\n\n\u201cHe wrote that there was a COVID-19 positive patient in Ba Ring Gone Village who was sent to Taungoo and warned people to be careful,\u201d said a police officer from Yaytarshay police station. \u201cAn official from the township administration office filed a lawsuit under the Natural Disaster Management Law\u2019s Article 27.\u201d\n\nThe article says that anyone who spreads misinformation about a disaster with the aim of sparking dread among the public shall be punished with a maximum of one year in prison and a fine.\n\nSince the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the Myanmar government has told people in the country not to spread the rumors and to beware of fake news.\n\nAs soon as the country\u2019s first COVID-19 case was reported, the government issued repeated warnings that anyone who spreads rumors or fake news will be punished according to the law.\n\nThe government also warned that those who refuse to follow rules and regulations imposed to combat the coronavirus could face lawsuits under the 2013 Natural Disaster Management Law\n\nA groom who held a wedding celebration in Tamu, Sagaing Division, in violation of local authorities\u2019 instructions to postpone the event was sentenced to six months in prison and ordered to pay a one million kyat fine (US$700) on Friday, under the Natural Disaster Management Law.\n\nThe groom, Htan Lin Shein, arrived from the United States and did not home quarantine for 14 days, instead choosing to hold his wedding reception on March 28, despite authorities\u2019 instructions that he must postpone the event to avoid drawing a crowd. Another groom from the same township is facing the same lawsuit under the same law for also holding his wedding.\n\nIn Sagaing Division\u2019s Khin Oo Township, a man is facing a lawsuit under the same law for holding a Buddhist ritual ceremony to celebrate the ordination of local young monks.\n\nA man in Sagaing\u2019s Ye Oo Township was arrested for running away from a government COVID-19 quarantine facility and is also facing a lawsuit under the Natural Disaster Management Law.\n\nTwo men from Sagaing\u2019s Ayadaw Township and Mandalay\u2019s Tada-U Township were arrested and sued for attacking local authorities who were conducting patrols and education programs on coronavirus prevention.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s KBZ Bank Donates Nearly $1M to Coronavirus Efforts\n\nKanbawza Bank has donated nearly US$1 million worth of medical supplies to Myanmar\u2019s health ministry to support efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19.\n\n\u2013 By The Irrawaddy\n\nMyanmar\u2019s largest private bank, Kanbawza (KBZ) Bank, airlifted in hospital supplies from China as part of a 1.4 billion-kyat (nearly US$1 million) donation to Myanmar\u2019s health ministry for use in combatting COVID-19.\n\nSome conglomerates in Myanmar are supporting the government in the fight against the coronavirus by donating medical supplies such as masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as money.\n\nKBZ Bank Deputy Chief Executive Director Nang Lang Kham gave the supplies to Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) Deputy Director-General Dr. Tun Myint at the Yangon International Airport last Friday.\n\nThe supplies included 23,000 sets of PPE and 700,000 surgical masks, as well as hand gel, thermometers, N-95 masks, safety googles, foot covers and gloves.\n\nKBZ Bank transported some supplies across the China-Myanmar border in the last week of March, but to fulfill the urgent need in Myanmar, the bank also chartered a Myanmar Airways International plane to airlift supplies from Guangzhou, China.\n\nThe bank also donated 600,000 surgical masks and 3,000 sets of PPE that it imported from China through the Muse border checkpoint in Shan State between March 27 and Friday.\n\nOn March 18, KBZ bank and its counterpart, KBZ MS General Insurance, donated 100 million kyats (over US$71,000) to MOHS for COVID-19 treatment.\n\nMyanmar so far has 21 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Sunday, including one patient with nasal cancer who died last week.\n\nMOHS spokesman Dr. Tha Tun Kyaw told The Irrawaddy that the government is doing its best to prepare hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients, in case Myanmar has more confirmed cases in the near future.\n\n\u201cWhether these donated supplies will be enough for treatment is hard to tell, as we don\u2019t know yet how many more patients we will have,\u201d he said on Monday.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s State Counselor Vows \u2018Zero Tolerance\u2019 for Price Gougers of COVID-19 Protective Items\n\nThose who jack up prices of essential items needed in the fight against COVID-19 will face prosecution, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has warned.\n\n\u2013 By The Irrawaddy\n\nYANGON\u2014Myanmar State Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has issued a stern warning to anyone who would engage in price gouging on surgical masks amid a steady rise in COVID-19 cases in the country, saying she had a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy toward those who jack up prices of essential goods.\n\nAs of Sunday, 21 people had tested positive for COVID-19 in Myanmar, with one fatality related to the disease\n\nEven before the first positive case was detected in the country in late March, prices for ordinary surgical masks were beginning to skyrocket, partly due to hoarding by retailers.\n\nAmid panic buying and shortages at pharmacies, the face coverings, which cost just 50 kyats (about 3.5 US cents) in normal times, are now fetching 10 times that amount.\n\nAt the same time, in some hospitals doctors and nurses are publicly complaining that they have been working without proper Personal Protective Equipment like facial coverings. Though the advisability of wearing masks is still being debated globally, growing numbers of people in Myanmar can be seen wearing them when venturing outdoors.\n\nOn Sunday, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi assured Myanmar people through her Facebook page that Myanmar\u2019s Ministry of Health and Sports had 6.3 million masks to be distributed this month, and that many more are in the pipeline.\n\nHowever, the mask issue was raised with Myanmar\u2019s de facto leader during her live videoconference on Monday with officials who are on the frontline in the fight against the disease in Bago Region, where three COVID-19 cases, including two children, were detected last week.\n\nWhen Dr. Aye Nyein, a regional medical official, complained about shortages and price gouging on masks, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi sternly said that raising the price when people were suffering was totally unethical.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlawful. We have a law against [gouging and hoarding]. If there is a complaint, we will take action,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThey are playing with people\u2019s lives for their personal interests. I have zero tolerance for it,\u201d she added.\n\nOn March 30, Myanmar\u2019s Ministry of Commerce imposed a ban on price gouging on food, medicines and equipment related to the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, as well as on hoarding such items, which have been declared \u201cessential goods\u201d.\n\nViolators face imprisonment for six months to three years under the Special Supplies and Services Law, the ministry said.\n\nSo far, there have been no reports of anyone being prosecuted under the law.\n\nYou may also like these stories:\n\nLatest COVID-19 Developments in Myanmar: April 1, 2020\n\nLatest COVID-19 Developments in Myanmar: April 2, 2020\n\nLatest COVID-19 Developments in Myanmar: April 3, 2020","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['600,000 surgical masks', '700,000 surgical masks']"}

Data source INS\n\nThere could be several factors to this: The larger and denser population, its role as a transport hub and the cooler weather (which can facilitate transmissions, according to recent scientific reports). There is also likely to be a testing bias towards Bogot\u00e1, with more labs based here (INS, District Health).\n\nTime to tapaboca\n\nAs we covered in the last update, there\u2019s been a global change of tack over face masks, and from today in Colombia people using public transport systems \u2013 buses, taxis, TransMilenios etc, \u2013 will have to use tapabocas or face a stiff fine.\n\nAccording to new presidential decrees, the face masks will be mandatory in \u201careas where there is a massive influx of people such as market places, supermarkets, banks, pharmacies, where it is not possible to maintain a minimum distance of 1 metre.\u201d Don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.\n\nRemember you can make your own cloth face covering if there are none to buy.\n\nHOW TO MAKE FACE MASK WITH FILTER POCKET ~ DIY Reusable Face Mask IN 2 MINUTES\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nTesting times\n\nHow is COVID-19 testing in Colombia? In several updates we\u2019ve talked about the importance of testing, and the problems faced in Colombia with faulty machinery, tests samples not surviving transfer to Bogot\u00e1 for analysis, or patients never getting their test results back.\n\nThe latest news is that health authorities are rolling out COVID-19 testing to 60 labs with more decentralised sites. Health authorities recently announced collaboration with South Korea. Details are scarce, but according to some media reports \u201ca plane will be sent\u201d to Seoul to collect a large quantity of test materials as part of a plan to increase testing capacity to 17,000 a day.\n\nBogot\u00e1 Quarantine: life in Usaqu\u00e9n\n\nIn the month since the first confirmed coronavirus case in Colombia, the INS reports having done 23,000 tests, an average rate of 760 per day, though in the last week this has increased to 1,700 per day, with some lab teams working in shifts to process samples 24 hours.\n\nLook east to ease the lockdown?\n\nIn the previous update we looked at what happens next after the current national three-week quarantine ends on April 13.\n\nColombia\u2019s health minister has already given some hints: the \u201caccordion strategy\u201d of squeezing and releasing movement restrictions according to how the outbreak is going, i.e. follow the science.\n\nToday President Duque talked about \u201csmart isolation\u201d similar to used in Asian countries like South Korea and Singapore which rely on mass testing, rapid contact tracing, and selected isolation of contacts of positive cases.

Is this good news? Or a calm before the storm? And how far can we trust the testing?\n\nLatest figures show 798 confirmed cases and 14 deaths, with continued steady rises in the big cities \u2013 particularly Bogot\u00e1 and Cali. The two most recent fatalities are a 63-year-old woman in Neiva and a 68-year-old man in Cali.\n\nData comes from Instituto Nacional de Salud, an oversight body charged with \u2013 among other things \u2013 compiling stats on transmissible diseases and testing for the COVID-19.\n\nRead all our coronavirus in coverage here.\n\nINS director Martha Luc\u00eda Ospina told El Tiempo this week that the respiratory disease was unstoppable and that \u201cno health system in the world\u201d could absorb the peak caseload of the disease. Even with containment, she said the virus could cause 3,000 deaths in Colombia.\n\n\u201cEvery effort is made by the government to make a more effective health response, but we are talking about a minimum of around 3,000 dead,\u201d she told El Tiempo. \u201cWe are not playing at creating fear, but understanding the epidemic\u2019s capacity to kill. We don\u2019t want that to happen, but mathematically it is a probability.\u201d\n\nCoronavirus curve to March 30. Data source: INS\n\nAccording to Dr Ospina, 80% of the people infected in Colombia with COVID-19 would get only light symptoms.\n\nTesting was improving with air patrols now able to collect samples from remoter parts of the country, she said. Test reagents had arrived in Colombia, but there was still a shortage of specialised equipment and trained staff. Despite the constraints, the INS expects to oversee 300,000 tests in the next two months.\n\nSurvival of the healthiest\n\nIn the last update, we suggested that Colombia\u2019s young population (average age 30 years, with only 7.5% over 70 years old) could better resist the virus. Worldwide data for fatality rates and age ranges show that so far in the outbreak, people aged over 80 with the disease have a much higher probability of dying (15%) than younger folk (from 8% to 0.2%).\n\nTo date, the average age of Colombia\u2019s 12 coronavirus deaths is 63 years with two people under 40. More surprising is that the average age of people currently hospitalised in intensive care in Colombia is 55 years, with several under 40 years old. This confirms the fact that coronavirus does not just kill los viejos.\n\nHow you can help vulnerable Bogotanos during the quarantine\n\nWhat are the possible factors in severe cases in younger people? According to the U.S.\u2019s Centre for Disease Control (CDC), coronavirus is complicated by:\n\nchronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma\n\nheart disease with complications\n\ncompromised immune systems (including those on cancer treatment)\n\nsevere obesity (body mass index \u226540)\n\ndiabetes, kidney problems, liver disease.\n\nFor example, one of Colombia\u2019s younger deaths in Cali was a \u201c36-year-old man with obesity and a smoker,\u201d according to city authorities.\n\nPerfect pandemic storm\n\nAccording to a recent New York Times article, a country\u2019s poor general health can create a \u201cperfect pandemic storm\u201d. In the U.S. cardiovascular disease in some form affects half the adult population, 36% are obese, and 10% have diabetes.\n\nBy some measures, Colombia is slightly healthier with adult obesity at 22%, diabetes in adults at 7%, and 25% with high blood pressure. But it\u2019s far from perfect and worse than Asian countries that for dietary reasons often have less of these chronic diseases.\n\nOne contradiction of the current quarantine in Colombia is stopping people from getting out to exercise \u2013 a key factor in reducing chronic conditions such as high blood pressure. If quarantine continues, the country needs a plan to let people keep fit while maintaining social distance.\n\nExercise combats many chronic diseases. Will it be worked into the quarantine plan?\n\nHow long will the COVID-19 quarantine last?\n\nAnd talking of quarantine, the question on everyone\u2019s mind is: for how much more will be locked down? Bogota\u2019s lockdown started on March 20 and continues with the national initiative until April 13. But then what?\n\nWhile most people support the isolation measures, halfway into lockdown there is a lack of certainty creating mental limbo on top of the economic hardships at both street and macro level. Could we last the biblical cuarenta (40) days?\n\nThis week Bogot\u00e1\u2019s mayor Claudia L\u00f3pez said that the capital\u2019s citizens were complying with the quarantine \u201c75%\u201d and should \u201cget it in their heads that the quarantine could last more than three months\u201c.\n\nIn a slightly softer message, Colombia\u2019s President Duque told TV viewers on Sunday that the state will keep some current measures and \u201cdesign others\u201d for after April 13, and that \u201cthe post-isolation plan will revolve around the preservation of the greatest number of lives.\u201d\n\nCoronavirus: what were they thinking?\n\nWhat happens next depends on what the COVID-19 infection data shows these coming weeks. What we do know is that so far Colombia\u2019s COVID-19 response has followed the advice of international experts leading the response, such as the WHO, and has been an early adopter of enforced isolation.\n\nDuque\u2019s team will also be watching closely how the outbreak evolves in other worse-hit countries.\n\nBraking the coronavirus outbreak\n\nFrom that we know that strict quarantine is showing signs of slowing the deadly outbreak in Italy, for example. And strict social distancing could be behind an early drop in the growth of coronavirus cases in Ireland, where cases are still low in numbers.\n\nBut some bad news from Hong Kong is that early easing of lockdowns there quickly led to an upsurge in cases, leading to a rapid return to clamp-down.\n\nHong Kong and China are now trying a series of short sharp quarantines interspersed with easing of restrictions and localised lockdowns in zones where cases have surged.\n\nThis means quick mass testing and fast reactions by health authorities, the goal being to ease restrictions while continuing to slow the virus spread so as not to overload health systems \u2013 thus saving lives \u2013 meanwhile encouraging herd immunity and buying time until a vaccine or cure comes along.\n\nGiven the economic problems caused by long-term lockdowns, the Hong Kong model could be the way forward and maybe what Colombia\u2019s experts already have in mind.\n\nCOVID-19 antibodies are best\n\nSome good news is that the COVID-19 is slow to mutate. This makes an eventual vaccine more effective, but also suggests people previously infected can recover and return to normal life with their natural antibodies \u2013 which people form while fighting the virus \u2013 to protect them from further disease.\n\nThis requires the newer \u201cantibody tests\u201d, now being rolled out, which tell doctors if someone has been infected in the past, even if they were not aware.\n\nCity at a standstill. Can antibody testing for COVID-19 get things moving again?\n\nIn fact, some countries like Germany are already proposing mass testing and \u201cantibody certificates\u201d whereby people can return to work if proven to be naturally immune.\n\nAntibody testing could also answer the burning question: Exactly how many of us caught the COVID-19 in Colombia but never knew? These tests will hopefully get to Colombia and show us the way forward.\n\nColombia\u2019s coronavirus website www.coronaviruscolombia.gov.co\n\nis now up with a host of useful info, latest data, advice on benefits, virtual schooling for kids, where to donate money etc.","tests":"['300,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Or how many really died of the disease.\n\nNew coranavirus detection devices and \u2018rapid tests\u2019 are being rushed out around the world, including a five-minute portable kit announced today.\n\nYoung and coronavirus-death free?\n\nWill Colombia\u2019s relatively young population mean less coronavirus deaths? Let\u2019s hope so. Worldwide stats show a sharp increased in COVID-19 fatality rate over 70 years of age. See the table below from Worldometer.\n\nAGE DEATH RATE WORLDWIDE\n\n(probability of dying if infected by the virus) 80+ years old 14.80% 70-79 years old 8.00% 60-69 years old 3.60% 50-59 years old 1.30% 40-49 years old 0.40% 30-39 years old 0.20% 20-29 years old 0.20% 10-19 years old 0.20% 0-9 years old 0\n\nColombia\u2019s relatively young average age of 30 years could means less fatalities since younger people get a less severe illness.\n\nIn Colombia only 7.5% of the population is over 70 years old. Compare this to Italy, with an average age of 47 and 20% of the population is over 70, where you would expect at least twice as many deaths.\n\nThe scramble to make beds\n\nAnother key factor in reducing coronavirus deaths is a health system\u2019s capacity to save lives, and the last days we have seen the US, and European countries, scrambling to set up emergency intensive care wards and source equipment such as ventilators which keep severe patients alive.\n\nOne shocking fact revealed by El Tiempo today was Colombia\u2019s lack of \u2018UCI\u2019 (intensive care) beds, currently there are 5,000 across the country though five large departments (Vaup\u00e9s, Vichada, Guain\u00eda, Amazonas y Guaviare) are without a single one. It has long been a tradition to transfer patients from these places in air-ambulances to Bogot\u00e1 or Villavicencio.\n\nFive remote departments currently transfer severely ill patients to distant cities, and lack an intensive are beds in their hospitals. This will affect coronavirus cases.\n\nAdded to that, 80% of the current ICU beds in Colombia are already full with other patients. How will we cope?\n\nAccording to projections reported by El Tiempo, even under the best case scenario, by May the country will need 16,000 ICU beds to cope with severe cases.\n\nCoronavirus leaves tourists stranded in Colombia.\n\nSo like many other countries, Colombia is in a race against time to ready its health system and, as mentioned in previous updates, is creating pop-up hospitals in warehouses and conference centres.\n\nBut will it be enough?

Over the past two decades, however, the EPS\u2019s have become notorious for their rampant corruption and mismanagement.\n\nAccording to newspaper El Espectador, of the 45 companies that mediate between Colombians and healthcare providers registered in January last year, only 19 operate without any kind of sanction.\n\nFive so-called EPS\u2019s were liquidated, another three were banned from operating in parts of the country and another 18 are under special surveillance, the newspaper reported.\n\nEvery Colombian must compulsory pay these EPS\u2019s. Nevertheless, these companies have more often than not pocketed profits instead of paying hospitals, leaving them on the brink of bankruptcy and medical staff unpaid.\n\nPresident Ivan Duque promised a $1.5 billion injection into the country\u2019s health sector in an attempt to cancel at least some of the EPS\u2019s debts to the hospitals. According to the Colombian Hospital Association, however, the EPS owe the hospitals as much as $7.7 billion.\n\nAlso now the International Health Institute (INS), The Colombian Medical Federation (FMC) and the Comptroller General\u2019s Office accuse the private companies of not adequately carrying out coronavirus tests on patients.\n\nFurthermore, one FMC executive accused some EPS\u2019s of planning to grant ICU units to the highest bidder, effectively excluding most of their paying clients from life-saving healthcare while forcing a bidding war among those who can afford excessive health payments.\n\nLack of testing\n\nPartially because of the EPS\u2019s negligence, Colombia is the world\u2019s worst performer when it comes to performing coronavirus tests per million inhabitants, according to Health Policy Watch (HPW).\n\nThese tests are elementary for the early detection of infections, and allow the isolation of infected people and the prevention of the uncontrolled spread of the virus.\n\nThe lack of testing allows infected people who do not (yet) notice any symptoms to infect others uncontrollably.\n\nSimilarly, it reduces the reliability of statistics gathered and increases the possibility that the real number of infections is much higher than the confirmed ones.\n\nAccording to the HPW, Colombia\u2019s health facilities are currently carrying out only 209 tests per million inhabitants compared to 2032 in the US, 7566 in South Korea and 68286 in Iceland.\n\nColombia\u2019s universities are working closely with the INS to dramatically increase the country\u2019s testing capacity.\n\nMedical supply shortages\n\nLike many other countries, Colombia\u2019s government has had trouble providing medical personnel with the adequate protective gear that allows them to treat patients without putting themselves in danger.\n\nThis could take out much of the country\u2019s medical personnel if they are infected while on the frontline of helping infected patients and leave hospitals without doctors and nurses.\n\nMany physicians have been forced to make their own bio-safety suits, masks and gloves that are increasingly difficult to import.\n\n\u2018The decision of US President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to attend an unprecedented health crisis in his own country, for example, banned the export of so-called N-95 masks for medical personnel that had been ordered by Colombia.\n\nThe military, volunteers and even former FARC guerrillas have begun producing masks and uniforms to provide the doctors and nurses with the protection they need to treat patients without falling ill themselves.\n\nMedical engineers have additionally embarked on the production of low-cost and open source ventilators that could help safe lives when the number of patients needing ventilators exceed the 8,000 ventilators available in the country.\n\nThe state\u2019s solvency\n\nColombia\u2019s state finances were already in trouble before the coronavirus broke out because of an oil war between Russia and Saudi Arabia that sank the price of oil, Colombia\u2019s largest export product.\n\nThe dropping oil prices and the devaluation of the peso pretty much destroyed Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla\u2019s budget.\n\nThe government made unprecedented investments in healthcare, food provision for the poor while the country is in quarantine, the freezing of tax collection and making sure the country\u2019s financial system doesn\u2019t collapse.\n\nThe central bank stepped in announcing unprecedented measures, but still their capacity has their limits and there comes a point the state simply goes bankrupt.\n\nThe World Bank announced it would extend a $250 million loan, but this is not even enough to compensate the expected $1.2 billion the Health Ministry said the country\u2019s healthcare system would need to deal with the pandemic, let alone the other emergency measures.\n\nTo make sure Colombia doesn\u2019t go broke many billions are needed. With the entire global economy at risk, chances are slim this money will become available any time soon.\n\nThe entire world is going to need a solution to the unprecedented damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, but governments must first attend their domestic crises before coming up with a global solution.","tests":"['209 tests']","ventilators":"['8,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

By comparison, the US is expected to face 81,766 deaths, according to forecasts released on Sunday by IHME.\n\n\"We are expecting a foreboding few weeks for people in many parts of Europe,\" said IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray. \"It seems likely the number of deaths will exceed our projections for the United States.\"\n\nThis is despite the declines in deaths that are now occurring in Italy and Spain.\n\nThe death toll in many countries is compounded by demand for hospital resources well in excess of what is available. For example, peak demand in the UK is expected to total 102,794 hospital beds needed compared to 17,765 available, 24,544 ICU beds compared to 799 ICU beds available, and 20,862 ventilators needed (with data currently unavailable on ventilators available).\n\nToday's announcement on Europe finds that most regions of Italy and Spain have passed their peaks in the number of deaths, while other nations are approaching their peaks and still others facing peak mortality later in April.\n\nCountries that are about to peak or are quickly approaching peak in this wave of the epidemic include The Netherlands, Ireland, Austria, and Luxembourg. The Czech Republic and Romania are midway through their expected trajectories. Other nations including the United Kingdom, Germany, Norway, and Greece are still early in their trajectories and face fast-rising death tolls through their peaks in the second and third weeks of April.\n\n\"It is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,\" Murray said. \"Those nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation's trajectory will change \u2013 and dramatically for the worse \u2013 if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.\"\n\nMurray cautioned that easing these precautions too soon during the first wave of the pandemic could lead to new rounds of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. He defines the end of this \"wave\" as a ratio of 0.3 deaths per 1 million people. IHME's projections assume that social distancing measures, if not currently implemented, will be implemented within one week.\n\n\"To decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass produced, and distributed widely,\" Murray said.\n\nIHME started making projections of the pandemic's impact in the United States state-by-state on March 26. Today's announcement is the first set of predictions for European nations and is based on modeling the peak in death rates and hospital usage in Wuhan City in China, where the virus was first discovered, as well as data from seven European locations that have peaked, including Madrid, Spain; Castile-La Mancha, Spain; Tuscany, Italy; Emilia-Romagna, Italy; Liguria, Italy; Piedmont, Italy; and Lombardy, Italy.\n\nOf these eight locations that have reached the peak regarding daily deaths, only one, Wuhan, has currently brought new cases to nearly zero.\n\nThe analysis is based on an extensive range of information and data sources, including:\n\nLocal governments, national governments, and the World Health Organization\n\nGovernment declarations on implementation of social distancing policies\n\nAge-specific death rate data from China , Italy , South Korea , and the US\n\nHere are some country-specific findings from IHME's latest forecasting:\n\nITALY : The first wave of the pandemic has peaked in Italy , and peak resource use for ICU beds and ventilators was on March 28 .

While Crozier\u2019s warnings were dismissed and his pleas for help to Navy leadership were met with punishment, more men on his ship wound up testing positive for the virus, with 137 cases as of Saturday.\n\nIn addition to backing the Navy\u2019s decision to ax Crozier, Trump appeared to mock him for daring to sound the alarm about the virus.\n\n\u201cI thought it looked terrible what he did, to write a letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is not a class on literature.\u201d\n\nHe went on to take aim at the governors of states that have been hit hard by the coronavirus, claiming without evidence that the states were asking for more equipment than they needed. Trump singled out New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, claiming that the estimates that New York will need 40,000 ventilators were overestimates.\n\n\u201c40,000, think of it,\u201d Trump said. \u201c40,000. It\u2019s not possible. They won\u2019t need that many.\u201d\n\nWhile Trump won praise from some of his critics earlier this week for appearing to finally grasp the severity of the pandemic, on Saturday he once again seemed to buck expert advice by suggesting certain protective restrictions could soon be loosened.\n\nSpeaking about Easter Sunday\u2014the \u201cbeautiful\u201d date by which he had earlier suggested things could go back to normal\u2014he mused about churches possibly holding special services with social distancing in mind.\n\n\u201cMaybe we could allow special, for churches, maybe we could talk about it. Maybe we could allow them, with great separation outside, on Easter Sunday. I don\u2019t know, it's something we should talk about,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have to get this country open. This country was not designed to be closed...we're paying people to stay home...and they want to go to work.\u201d\n\nTrump also promoted hydroxychloroquine, the drug that\u2019s become key to the Trump administration\u2019s coronavirus response even though the FDA hasn\u2019t approved its use against the virus.\n\n\u201cI may take it,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have to ask my doctors about that.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, President Trump announced a new CDC recommendation that Americans wear cloth or fabric face masks in public to help prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus, but bizarrely said that he wouldn\u2019t bother to wear one himself.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['40,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

He was working in a local supermarket.\n\nThe plant is in no fit state to restart production, so Ukroboronprom will share the technology with interested private companies and has offered to help certify a new product quickly and provide production facilities, Nayyem said.\n\n\u201cWe will give everyone access to this documentation because we understand that the crisis is now,\u201d Nayyem said.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me whether there is a wizard who can come in and do everything, I would like to believe in it, but I think that now we need to \u2026 accept that industry in this country has been allowed to die for decades.\u201d\n\nHard Times\n\n\n\nSome 20 years ago around 6,000 people worked at the Burevisnyk factory, producing hardware including radar systems for submarines.

They are crucial for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe COVID-19, the disease coronavirus causes.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases has reached 480 in Ukraine, with eleven deaths. The country is one of Europe\u2019s poorest and health spending per capita is a fraction of its western peers.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, we must admit that Ukraine\u2019s healthcare system is not ready for it,\u201d Health Minister Illia Yemets said.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['1,117 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Not even one year after protesters forced former dictator Omar al-Bashir to step down, the transitional government faces serious economic and political challenges that could jeopardize its plans for transition to civilian rule.\n\nThe government's efforts to fight against the pandemic could be crucial to the transition.\n\nAs of today, Sudan has seven confirmed cases of infection and two deaths. Given the lack of widespread testing, the numbers could be higher. In the coming weeks, they may overwhelm the already-challenged health sector.\n\nSudan\u2019s health sector already faced serious challenges of corruption, underfunding, and mismanagement. Even before COVID-19, there was a shortage of nurses, critical care beds, and reportedly only 80 ventilators in the whole country. Donations of testing kits, masks, and protective gear from Chinese billionaire Jack Ma and the Alibaba foundation could ease the challenge but won't be sufficient.\n\nSudanese authorities have tried to act quickly in the face of the spreading virus. On January 28, authorities set up checkpoints to screen travelers at points of entry. On March 14, they closed schools and universities. Two days later, they closed the airports, ports, and land crossings, banned travel between states, and required quarantining for incoming travelers. The latest step was imposing a night curfew on March 23. Khartoum state banned all mass gatherings on March 20. On March 25, authorities released 4,217 prisoners as a precautionary measure to reduce risk of transmission in detention.\n\nBut these steps aren't enough. Sudan has a long list of poor and vulnerable populations such as refugees and displaced communities from the country's conflict zones, many of whom live in large camp settings. Half the population lives under the poverty line, and many work in the informal sector, such as tea-sellers and day laborers. They may not have the luxury of social distancing or staying home.\n\nAnd restrictions on movement are making the economic situation worse, with commodity prices soaring across the country.\n\nAs authorities struggle to cope, they should focus on the most vulnerable: ramp up health services to crowded and under-serviced urban areas, provide water points and testing facilities, and increase public information about the virus.\n\nThe international donors who pledged to support Sudan's transition should recognize how critical this moment is and step up now. Even if the pandemic has slowed the pace of donor meetings and conferences, these governments need not let COVID-19 become yet another obstacle to Sudan's transition.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['80 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

She said the country does not have the logistics to face this disease -- there are not enough ICU beds, because of the cumulative destruction of the health system over 30 years.\n\n\n\nOn the positive side, Sudan recently received 100,000 face masks, 20,000 test kits and 1,000 medical suits from a Chinese business man as a gift.\n\n\n\nBut local reports say Sudan has only 80 ICU units in both the public and private sector.\n\n\n\nAbout 150 Sudanese students arrived early Friday from the United Arab Emirates after been evacuated from Wuhan province in China, the original epicenter of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThe students, who were quarantined for three weeks in China, refused to be quarantined any longer and held a sit-in at the airport, saying they had already tested negative for the virus.\n\n\n\nThe Ministry of Health allowed them to return to their homes.

The gel wouldn\u2019t have rubbed ink off a white board, much less disinfected the hands of the hundreds of staff and patients. According to hospital staff, the sanitizer has since been disposed of and replaced by the World Health Organization. A WHO spokesperson acknowledged the existence of \u201cinauthentic\u201d sanitizer. There is also a startling shortage of coronavirus tests and ventilators. WHO gave Afghanistan 1,500 testing kits, but only two laboratories in the country are equipped with machines that can process the test samples. The United Arab Emirates and China are donating tens of thousands of additional kits, said Dr. Wahid Majrooh, a senior adviser to the Afghan minister of public health. There are also plans to expand the number of diagnostic laboratories from two to 12.\n\nAs of April 2, the country\u2019s two designated coronavirus hospitals had only 12 working ventilators between them. Four of those were at a hospital in Herat, but as of last week, none had been installed, Dr. Nasir Farhang, a newly graduated medical doctor working at the hospital, told The Intercept. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any staff that know how to operate the ventilators or intubate [patients],\u201d Farhang said. The coronavirus pandemic couldn\u2019t have hit Afghanistan at a worse time. The country\u2019s top two candidates in the September 2019 presidential election have both claimed victory and held separate inauguration ceremonies. During a March 20 visit to Kabul, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to broker a resolution between Ashraf Ghani, whose election victory was recognized by the U.S., and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah. Days later, Pompeo announced that the State Department was cutting $1 billion in aid to Afghanistan this year. The political impasse also threatens to undermine a February 29 agreement signed by U.S. and Taliban representatives in Qatar which many hoped would lead to the end of the 19-year war. Herat, a city of about half a million, is tied to Iran by trade, culture, and as the port through which hundreds of thousands of Afghans pass annually, mostly young men heading to Iran to find work. That relationship has put Herat, which now has nearly three quarters of the country\u2019s 258 positive cases, at the center of Afghanistan\u2019s coronavirus crisis. Experts say that number represents only a fraction of the actual figure for infections. A senior adviser to the Afghan Ministry of Health told The Intercept that based on patient data, 90 to 95 percent of Afghanistan\u2019s positive cases are in people who have recently returned from Iran, where nearly 50,000 cases have been recorded so far. The International Organization for Migration estimates that around 2.4 million Afghans are in Iran at any given time. The border has been a well-worn path for unskilled workers for decades. In recent years, with unemployment at 30 percent in Afghanistan, the flow has quickened. According to IOM, roughly 1,000 Afghan migrants per day were using the countries\u2019 two major border crossings with Iran \u2014 in Herat and Nimruz Provinces \u2014 to return home between January and March, when the number spiked.\n\nTravelers gather their belongings after crossing the border from Iran into Afghanistan at Islam Qala. Photo: Andrew Quilty for The Intercept\n\nOne day last week, 31-year-old Zabihullah crossed into Afghanistan from Iran on foot after several months working as a laborer there. After a two-hour minibus ride to the outskirts of Herat, he wove his way on foot through muddy puddles to another van that would carry him on to his home province of Faryab, where his expectations of finding work were minimal. \u201cThere is no solution,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll be lying down at home.\u201d In March, as thousands succumbed to the pandemic in Iran, worksites like Zabihullah\u2019s closed down and more than 100,000 Afghan workers began returning home, knowing they\u2019d never receive treatment in Iran if they became infected. As many as 15,000 crossed on some days in March, according to IOM. \u201cIt\u2019s the only place in the world with such massive cross-border returns during Covid,\u201d said Nick Bishop, who is heading IOM\u2019s coronavirus response in Afghanistan. Returns on such a scale would put tens of thousands of families under severe financial stress at the best of times. Now, the returnees also threaten to upend Afghanistan\u2019s fragile health care system and thrust the country into chaos unlike anything it\u2019s seen in the past two decades of war. \u201cEven before the global pandemic, humanitarian needs were immense due to decades of conflict [and] ongoing political instability,\u201d Linda Tom, of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Afghanistan, told The Intercept. This year, she said, 9.4 million people \u2014 almost a quarter of Afghanistan\u2019s population \u2014 are in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe Shahrak-e-Sabz informal settlement is home to more than 10,000 displaced families, mostly from Badghis Province to the north, who arrived after fleeing drought and conflict in 2018. Photo: Andrew Quilty for The Intercept\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s porous borders make detecting and preventing the virus\u2019s spread from neighboring countries virtually impossible. Fear and misinformation deter those with symptoms from seeking treatment, and Afghan homes typically host large, multigenerational families, making calls for social distancing unrealistic. At even greater risk are Afghanistan\u2019s 4 million displaced people, who are too busy trying to survive poverty and upheaval to worry about a new virus. The Shahrak-e-Sabz settlement on the outskirts of Herat is home to more than 10,000 families, most of whom built single-room mud-brick homes after fleeing fighting and drought in Badghis Province, to the north, in 2018. On a cold, wet afternoon last week, the virus was well down the list of residents\u2019 priorities. After two days of rain, roofs were leaking or caving in, and solar-powered water pumps had stopped working under the cloudy skies. Previously, several residents said, they had relied on humanitarian agencies for help in situations like this. But those agencies are now overwhelmingly focused on the coronavirus. Ghulam Sakhi, who runs a small store in the settlement, told The Intercept that nongovernmental organizations had come to the camp to inform them about the dangers of the pandemic. They \u201cbring leaflets and say you must eat fruit for its Vitamin C,\u201d he said outside his store, which is in a shipping container. \u201cBut we don\u2019t even have bread.\u201d\n\nLeft\/Top: A shopkeeper closes up his store at dusk in the small bazaar inside the Shahrak-e Sabz IDP camp.

Farhang, the recent graduate working at the hospital, told The Intercept last week that 56 Covid-19 patients out of what was at the time a countrywide total of 71 were being treated at the facility. A 45-year-old woman had died of the disease the night before, becoming the country\u2019s second reported coronavirus death. The lack of health workers trained to operate ventilators in Herat isn\u2019t just the result of an overstretched system dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. In 2018, an international medical professional, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, discovered two brand-new ventilators in Herat Regional Hospital. Both were emblazoned with large WHO stickers; neither was being used. A surgeon had covered them in a sheet to keep them clean and secure. \u201cNo one had been trained\u201d on how to use them, the foreign health worker told The Intercept, noting that such lack of preparation was \u201ctypical.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just ventilators. There were electric suction machines and cardiac monitors gathering dust because they were missing parts that weren\u2019t available in Afghanistan, said the foreign health professional, who worked in the hospital at the time. \u201cThe crazy thing was I remember so many people dying because of the lack of ventilator beds in ICU.\u201d\n\nWHO informed Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Public Health about the likely spread of the coronavirus in January. \u201cWhen we received notification of cases in Qom, [Iran], we went to the zero point\u201d at the border, Dr. Mohammad Asef Kabir, Herat\u2019s deputy health minister, told The Intercept. Given the likelihood that the virus would cross into Herat with returning Afghans, the ministry\u2019s initial efforts focused on detection and raising awareness about the need for good hygiene and social distancing. Such messaging, especially among vulnerable communities and those returning from Iran, is vital, IOM\u2019s Nick Bishop said. \u201cBased on socioeconomic status and levels of education, it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult to convey those messages in a meaningful way in the coming weeks when you\u2019re really going to see exponential growth in the case count and, potentially, in the number of people dying.\u201d\n\nAn ambulance departs a pediatric hospital that was recently repurposed as Herat\u2019s primary coronavirus isolation facility in the early days of the outbreak in Afghanistan. Photo: Andrew Quilty for The Intercept\n\nThe Afghan government, for its part, has been comparatively aggressive in instituting containment measures. On March 25, with just over 50 positive cases recorded in Herat, the province\u2019s governor shuttered nonessential stores and businesses and banned public gatherings; the same restrictions were imposed in Kabul a few days later. Schools were ordered to remain closed after the winter holiday on March 14 in an initial effort to slow the spread of the virus. But streets in the two cities now resemble a regular weekend, showing how difficult it will be to enforce wholesale behavioral change in a country where much of the population lives hand-to-mouth and is resigned to the knowledge that each day may be their last. As in China, Italy, Spain, and now the U.S., health facilities in Afghanistan are being converted into coronavirus treatment centers in anticipation of an onslaught of cases in the coming months. But the rollout has been plagued by staffing and equipment shortages which, if not resolved, will overwhelm the health system within weeks, according to local and international health professionals. An online advertisement posted by the public health ministry on March 29 listed 40 physician job vacancies. The Afghan Japan Hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Atiqullah Kotay, said that staff will be required to work 24-hour shifts because of the transport disruptions wrought by the city\u2019s partial lockdown. Still, he said it shouldn\u2019t be hard to hire more health care workers. \u201cIn Afghanistan,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are many medical professionals, but few jobs.\u201d Afghanistan\u2019s public health system \u201cis definitely \u2026 very weak,\u201d M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Afghanistan Country Representative Julien Raickman told The Intercept. \u201cIt\u2019s already a problem in normal times, but in the time of an epidemic, it will have a terrible impact.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Andrew Quilty for The Intercept\n\nSome medical professionals and NGO workers have criticized WHO\u2019s response. \u201cOf course [WHO] always thinks that money is the answer,\u201d a leading international health expert based in Kabul, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Intercept. \u201cYou can [have] all the money you want, but in the end, what for?\u201d More important, this person and others said, are human resources and supplies, which were becoming increasingly difficult to procure as air travel and borders shut down. \u201cWe expected more,\u201d Majrooh, the adviser to the minister of public health, told The Intercept. WHO\u2019s Amadullah Amarkhil said a massive amount of long-term support will be required. \u201cWHO is closely working with [the Ministry of Public Health] and assisting the Health Sector and its Partners since early January regarding COVID-19 on preparedness and has massively expanded its assistance in key areas,\u201d he said in an email. Early one morning last week, a small queue of patients waited for a prediagnosis consultation in an outdoor area near the Herat Regional Hospital\u2019s laboratory. The doctor, who wore a head-to-toe protective suit, was assisted by Mohammad Shafi Khotibi, a local nurse. On average, Khotibi explained, medical staff hold such consultations with about 100 patients daily, about 50 of whom are asked to give nose and throat swab samples for testing. The sampling kits are regularly replenished by the health ministry, but the process isn\u2019t seamless. \u201cEvery time it runs out,\u201d said Khotibi, \u201cthere is a gap of several hours.\u201d (At the time of publication, according to the ministry, 1,807 tests had been performed nationwide.)\n\nLeft\/Top: A patient is assessed for coronavirus symptoms in a consultation with a doctor, in white, and nurse Mohammad Shafi Khotibi, in green, outside Herat Regional Hospital's laboratory.

They are asking people to use masks and gloves, talking about washing hands with soap, those kinds of things,\" Khairullah told Al Jazeera, in a phone call from his village in the Taliban-controlled Darzaab district.\n\n\"They have cancelled all public gatherings, weddings and have asked people to pray at home instead of the mosques,\" he added.\n\nWhile Afghanistan has fewer than 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus, there are worries of an outbreak of the deadly virus in a country already facing years of conflict, displacement and poverty.\n\n\"We were directed by our health commission to hold public awareness campaigns, which we have undertaken in areas we control. We are also distributing pamphlets with advice on prevention of coronavirus in these districts,\" Qari Khalid Hijran, who described himself as the Taliban's newly-appointed director of public health of the Baghlan province, told Al Jazeera.\n\nGovernment welcomes move\n\n200122194509687\n\nAs surreal as it was for many Afghans, the Taliban's initiative was welcomed by the country's Ministry of Public Health.\n\n\"We noticed photos circulating on social media that show the Taliban's campaign, and regardless of their intention, we appreciate the cooperation from anyone or any group that supports the fight against coronavirus,\" Wahidullah Mayar, adviser to the Ministry of Public Health, told Al Jazeera.\n\nVisuals shared by Khairullah and the Taliban of the coronavirus workshops show men dressed in white medical gear and masks, holding disinfectant sprays as well as heavy weapons, as they gather around large posters of instructions on avoiding the coronavirus.\n\nThe Taliban flag and insignia were also visible in some of those photos.\n\nThe printed material, issued by the Taliban's \"General Commission for Public Health\", listed precautions that people should take, including regular prayers, eating \"halal\" as well as medical advice.\n\n\"We also provided villagers a list of vegetables that contain high amounts of vitamin C to boost immunity,\" Hijran said.\n\nWhile there are concerns over the Taliban's \"health commission\" providing information that meets medical standards, Mayar said his ministry was also running simultaneous campaigns in all provinces.\n\n\"We provide healthcare services in all provinces through trained health workers and 26 partner NGOs, even in Taliban areas. So there are professional medical workers that Afghans can turn to,\" he said.\n\nSafe passage to health workers\n\nThe Taliban has also offered safe passage to health workers and international organisations working to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Afghanistan.\n\n\"We are willing to allow and support government health workers or NGOs who can help the villagers in our areas. All they have to do is ask for our permission before coming so we can assess them, and we will let them work here,\" said Hijran, adding that they were \"ready to accept any help for the sake of people\".\n\nOnly last year, the Taliban had banned operations by the World Health Organization and the Red Cross in areas it controlled, citing \"suspicious activities\". It later partially lifted the Red Cross ban.\n\nMany Afghans also hope that the Taliban takes this opportunity to act on a United Nations call for a ceasefire in all conflict zones, due to the pandemic.\n\n\"The Taliban mentioned that if there is a [COVID-19] positive case, it will impose a ceasefire in that region. I ask them on behalf of the ministry to call for a ceasefire in the whole country,\" said Mayar. \"Let us fight this disease together instead of fighting each other.\"\n\nHowever, despite its public service campaign, the Taliban continues to attack Afghan forces, often claiming civilian lives.\n\nA recent peace deal signed with the United States to end the 18-year war amid hopes for negotiations with the Afghan government have done little to prevent those attacks.\n\n\"They coronavirus hasn't affected the conflict much. There is still fighting in many areas, and unless the fighting stops, the doctors and health teams can't openly work in these areas,\" Khairullah said.\n\nTaliban quarantines virus suspects\n\nKhairullah added that resources in his village were thinly stretched amid the pandemic.\n\n200405185652146\n\n\"There is only one health centre in our district with 10 beds and a few health workers. Medicine supplies are low and I heard that the Taliban has also requested government officials to bring more medicines,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile the Taliban may not have stopped fighting, the group says it has taken the coronavirus threat seriously by moving its fighters from the battlefields for the COVID-19 campaign.\n\nThe group has enforced lockdowns in affected areas and even quarantined those suspected of having the virus, especially Afghan refugees returning from Iran, the worst-hit Middle East country.\n\n\"About two weeks ago, they quarantined two villagers who had returned from Iran. They were not allowed to leave their homes and were later tested,\" said Khairullah.\n\nIn some northern provinces, the Taliban even detained returnees from Iran who had escaped government quarantine facilities.\n\nAbout two million Afghan refugees live in Iran, with thousands among them being deported to the shared western border in Herat province, making it the epicentre of Afghanistan's coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOf the nearly 400 cases in Afghanistan, more than 200 are from Herat alone, with seven deaths so far.\n\nHijran confirmed to Al Jazeera that the Taliban was quarantining and even testing Afghan citizens.\n\n\"We have health centres in our areas\u2026 in Baghlan, we have two centres. We check returnees in these health centres and even if they test negative, we lock them in homes for 20 days,\" he said, adding that the group had conducted 135 tests in Baghlan province so far.\n\nTesting kits available\n\nHijran also said the Taliban had COVID-19 testing kits, a shortage of which has been a matter of concern for Afghan health workers and organisations.\n\nFewer tests have made it difficult for the Afghan government to address the magnitude of the pandemic.\n\n\"We were provided 950 kits for Baghlan province from the Taliban health commission,\" Hijran said, without revealing who provided the kits to the group.\n\nFor civilians like Khairullah though, the Taliban's health initiatives, limited as they might be, provided a much-needed assurance to the people amid the crisis.\n\n\"This virus threatens all of us, whether Taliban or civilians or government,\" he said.","tests":"['135 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat. Now, there are concerns the troops, who are 75 miles from Iran where the coronavirus is rampant, could have COVID-19, he said.\n\nThe troops have not yet been tested for the sometimes-deadly virus though, Pocan added. The congressman said he learned of the situation after one of the service members' families contacted his office.\n\n\"If we're not providing proper health care to military personnel, especially so close to where there is a real flare of the pandemic near Iran ... that would be awful,\" Pocan told Military.com.\n\nRelated: Guard Activations in Response to Coronavirus Expected to Hit 1,000 by Weekend\n\nThe congressman declined to name the military base in Afghanistan where the troops are sick, citing concerns the service member's family had about coming forward.

Nine people have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nAbrams touted the efficacy of testing in that country, which quickly sped up how it could test for the virus. More than 189,000 South Korean citizens have now been tested at more than 100 testing centers.\n\n\"The Republic of Korea, learning from previous pandemic experience, revamped their system,\" he said. \"Three weeks ago, they could do about 5,000 tests a day.

Most carried small suitcases filled with essentials: a blanket, a change of clothes, a sweater. Whether they knew it or not, some also carried the coronavirus. The interchange was less a bus station than a muddy verge along the highway. Restaurants were open despite the city\u2019s \u201cmeasured lockdown\u201d order, and their owners hawked traditional Afghan soup and piles of rice sweetened with raisins and shredded carrots. While the returnees waited to depart for their home provinces, a white ambulance raced back and forth along the highway, ferrying coronavirus patients to the only hospital with an isolation unit in all of western Afghanistan. More people died last year in Afghanistan\u2019s war than in any other conflict.

This year, she said, 9.4 million people \u2014 almost a quarter of Afghanistan\u2019s population \u2014 are in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nThe Shahrak-e-Sabz informal settlement is home to more than 10,000 displaced families, mostly from Badghis Province to the north, who arrived after fleeing drought and conflict in 2018. Photo: Andrew Quilty for The Intercept\n\nAfghanistan\u2019s porous borders make detecting and preventing the virus\u2019s spread from neighboring countries virtually impossible. Fear and misinformation deter those with symptoms from seeking treatment, and Afghan homes typically host large, multigenerational families, making calls for social distancing unrealistic. At even greater risk are Afghanistan\u2019s 4 million displaced people, who are too busy trying to survive poverty and upheaval to worry about a new virus. The Shahrak-e-Sabz settlement on the outskirts of Herat is home to more than 10,000 families, most of whom built single-room mud-brick homes after fleeing fighting and drought in Badghis Province, to the north, in 2018. On a cold, wet afternoon last week, the virus was well down the list of residents\u2019 priorities. After two days of rain, roofs were leaking or caving in, and solar-powered water pumps had stopped working under the cloudy skies. Previously, several residents said, they had relied on humanitarian agencies for help in situations like this. But those agencies are now overwhelmingly focused on the coronavirus. Ghulam Sakhi, who runs a small store in the settlement, told The Intercept that nongovernmental organizations had come to the camp to inform them about the dangers of the pandemic. They \u201cbring leaflets and say you must eat fruit for its Vitamin C,\u201d he said outside his store, which is in a shipping container. \u201cBut we don\u2019t even have bread.\u201d\n\nLeft\/Top: A shopkeeper closes up his store at dusk in the small bazaar inside the Shahrak-e Sabz IDP camp.

Farhang, the recent graduate working at the hospital, told The Intercept last week that 56 Covid-19 patients out of what was at the time a countrywide total of 71 were being treated at the facility. A 45-year-old woman had died of the disease the night before, becoming the country\u2019s second reported coronavirus death. The lack of health workers trained to operate ventilators in Herat isn\u2019t just the result of an overstretched system dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. In 2018, an international medical professional, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, discovered two brand-new ventilators in Herat Regional Hospital. Both were emblazoned with large WHO stickers; neither was being used. A surgeon had covered them in a sheet to keep them clean and secure. \u201cNo one had been trained\u201d on how to use them, the foreign health worker told The Intercept, noting that such lack of preparation was \u201ctypical.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t just ventilators. There were electric suction machines and cardiac monitors gathering dust because they were missing parts that weren\u2019t available in Afghanistan, said the foreign health professional, who worked in the hospital at the time. \u201cThe crazy thing was I remember so many people dying because of the lack of ventilator beds in ICU.\u201d\n\nWHO informed Afghanistan\u2019s Ministry of Public Health about the likely spread of the coronavirus in January. \u201cWhen we received notification of cases in Qom, [Iran], we went to the zero point\u201d at the border, Dr. Mohammad Asef Kabir, Herat\u2019s deputy health minister, told The Intercept. Given the likelihood that the virus would cross into Herat with returning Afghans, the ministry\u2019s initial efforts focused on detection and raising awareness about the need for good hygiene and social distancing. Such messaging, especially among vulnerable communities and those returning from Iran, is vital, IOM\u2019s Nick Bishop said. \u201cBased on socioeconomic status and levels of education, it\u2019s going to be incredibly difficult to convey those messages in a meaningful way in the coming weeks when you\u2019re really going to see exponential growth in the case count and, potentially, in the number of people dying.\u201d\n\nAn ambulance departs a pediatric hospital that was recently repurposed as Herat\u2019s primary coronavirus isolation facility in the early days of the outbreak in Afghanistan. Photo: Andrew Quilty for The Intercept\n\nThe Afghan government, for its part, has been comparatively aggressive in instituting containment measures. On March 25, with just over 50 positive cases recorded in Herat, the province\u2019s governor shuttered nonessential stores and businesses and banned public gatherings; the same restrictions were imposed in Kabul a few days later. Schools were ordered to remain closed after the winter holiday on March 14 in an initial effort to slow the spread of the virus. But streets in the two cities now resemble a regular weekend, showing how difficult it will be to enforce wholesale behavioral change in a country where much of the population lives hand-to-mouth and is resigned to the knowledge that each day may be their last. As in China, Italy, Spain, and now the U.S., health facilities in Afghanistan are being converted into coronavirus treatment centers in anticipation of an onslaught of cases in the coming months. But the rollout has been plagued by staffing and equipment shortages which, if not resolved, will overwhelm the health system within weeks, according to local and international health professionals. An online advertisement posted by the public health ministry on March 29 listed 40 physician job vacancies. The Afghan Japan Hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Atiqullah Kotay, said that staff will be required to work 24-hour shifts because of the transport disruptions wrought by the city\u2019s partial lockdown. Still, he said it shouldn\u2019t be hard to hire more health care workers. \u201cIn Afghanistan,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are many medical professionals, but few jobs.\u201d Afghanistan\u2019s public health system \u201cis definitely \u2026 very weak,\u201d M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Afghanistan Country Representative Julien Raickman told The Intercept. \u201cIt\u2019s already a problem in normal times, but in the time of an epidemic, it will have a terrible impact.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Andrew Quilty for The Intercept\n\nSome medical professionals and NGO workers have criticized WHO\u2019s response. \u201cOf course [WHO] always thinks that money is the answer,\u201d a leading international health expert based in Kabul, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told The Intercept. \u201cYou can [have] all the money you want, but in the end, what for?\u201d More important, this person and others said, are human resources and supplies, which were becoming increasingly difficult to procure as air travel and borders shut down. \u201cWe expected more,\u201d Majrooh, the adviser to the minister of public health, told The Intercept. WHO\u2019s Amadullah Amarkhil said a massive amount of long-term support will be required. \u201cWHO is closely working with [the Ministry of Public Health] and assisting the Health Sector and its Partners since early January regarding COVID-19 on preparedness and has massively expanded its assistance in key areas,\u201d he said in an email. Early one morning last week, a small queue of patients waited for a prediagnosis consultation in an outdoor area near the Herat Regional Hospital\u2019s laboratory. The doctor, who wore a head-to-toe protective suit, was assisted by Mohammad Shafi Khotibi, a local nurse. On average, Khotibi explained, medical staff hold such consultations with about 100 patients daily, about 50 of whom are asked to give nose and throat swab samples for testing. The sampling kits are regularly replenished by the health ministry, but the process isn\u2019t seamless. \u201cEvery time it runs out,\u201d said Khotibi, \u201cthere is a gap of several hours.\u201d (At the time of publication, according to the ministry, 1,807 tests had been performed nationwide.)\n\nLeft\/Top: A patient is assessed for coronavirus symptoms in a consultation with a doctor, in white, and nurse Mohammad Shafi Khotibi, in green, outside Herat Regional Hospital's laboratory.

They are asking people to use masks and gloves, talking about washing hands with soap, those kinds of things,\" Khairullah told Al Jazeera, in a phone call from his village in the Taliban-controlled Darzaab district.\n\n\"They have cancelled all public gatherings, weddings and have asked people to pray at home instead of the mosques,\" he added.\n\nWhile Afghanistan has fewer than 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus, there are worries of an outbreak of the deadly virus in a country already facing years of conflict, displacement and poverty.\n\n\"We were directed by our health commission to hold public awareness campaigns, which we have undertaken in areas we control. We are also distributing pamphlets with advice on prevention of coronavirus in these districts,\" Qari Khalid Hijran, who described himself as the Taliban's newly-appointed director of public health of the Baghlan province, told Al Jazeera.\n\nGovernment welcomes move\n\n200122194509687\n\nAs surreal as it was for many Afghans, the Taliban's initiative was welcomed by the country's Ministry of Public Health.\n\n\"We noticed photos circulating on social media that show the Taliban's campaign, and regardless of their intention, we appreciate the cooperation from anyone or any group that supports the fight against coronavirus,\" Wahidullah Mayar, adviser to the Ministry of Public Health, told Al Jazeera.\n\nVisuals shared by Khairullah and the Taliban of the coronavirus workshops show men dressed in white medical gear and masks, holding disinfectant sprays as well as heavy weapons, as they gather around large posters of instructions on avoiding the coronavirus.\n\nThe Taliban flag and insignia were also visible in some of those photos.\n\nThe printed material, issued by the Taliban's \"General Commission for Public Health\", listed precautions that people should take, including regular prayers, eating \"halal\" as well as medical advice.\n\n\"We also provided villagers a list of vegetables that contain high amounts of vitamin C to boost immunity,\" Hijran said.\n\nWhile there are concerns over the Taliban's \"health commission\" providing information that meets medical standards, Mayar said his ministry was also running simultaneous campaigns in all provinces.\n\n\"We provide healthcare services in all provinces through trained health workers and 26 partner NGOs, even in Taliban areas. So there are professional medical workers that Afghans can turn to,\" he said.\n\nSafe passage to health workers\n\nThe Taliban has also offered safe passage to health workers and international organisations working to prevent the spread of coronavirus in Afghanistan.\n\n\"We are willing to allow and support government health workers or NGOs who can help the villagers in our areas. All they have to do is ask for our permission before coming so we can assess them, and we will let them work here,\" said Hijran, adding that they were \"ready to accept any help for the sake of people\".\n\nOnly last year, the Taliban had banned operations by the World Health Organization and the Red Cross in areas it controlled, citing \"suspicious activities\". It later partially lifted the Red Cross ban.\n\nMany Afghans also hope that the Taliban takes this opportunity to act on a United Nations call for a ceasefire in all conflict zones, due to the pandemic.\n\n\"The Taliban mentioned that if there is a [COVID-19] positive case, it will impose a ceasefire in that region. I ask them on behalf of the ministry to call for a ceasefire in the whole country,\" said Mayar. \"Let us fight this disease together instead of fighting each other.\"\n\nHowever, despite its public service campaign, the Taliban continues to attack Afghan forces, often claiming civilian lives.\n\nA recent peace deal signed with the United States to end the 18-year war amid hopes for negotiations with the Afghan government have done little to prevent those attacks.\n\n\"They coronavirus hasn't affected the conflict much. There is still fighting in many areas, and unless the fighting stops, the doctors and health teams can't openly work in these areas,\" Khairullah said.\n\nTaliban quarantines virus suspects\n\nKhairullah added that resources in his village were thinly stretched amid the pandemic.\n\n200405185652146\n\n\"There is only one health centre in our district with 10 beds and a few health workers. Medicine supplies are low and I heard that the Taliban has also requested government officials to bring more medicines,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\nWhile the Taliban may not have stopped fighting, the group says it has taken the coronavirus threat seriously by moving its fighters from the battlefields for the COVID-19 campaign.\n\nThe group has enforced lockdowns in affected areas and even quarantined those suspected of having the virus, especially Afghan refugees returning from Iran, the worst-hit Middle East country.\n\n\"About two weeks ago, they quarantined two villagers who had returned from Iran. They were not allowed to leave their homes and were later tested,\" said Khairullah.\n\nIn some northern provinces, the Taliban even detained returnees from Iran who had escaped government quarantine facilities.\n\nAbout two million Afghan refugees live in Iran, with thousands among them being deported to the shared western border in Herat province, making it the epicentre of Afghanistan's coronavirus outbreak.\n\nOf the nearly 400 cases in Afghanistan, more than 200 are from Herat alone, with seven deaths so far.\n\nHijran confirmed to Al Jazeera that the Taliban was quarantining and even testing Afghan citizens.\n\n\"We have health centres in our areas\u2026 in Baghlan, we have two centres. We check returnees in these health centres and even if they test negative, we lock them in homes for 20 days,\" he said, adding that the group had conducted 135 tests in Baghlan province so far.\n\nTesting kits available\n\nHijran also said the Taliban had COVID-19 testing kits, a shortage of which has been a matter of concern for Afghan health workers and organisations.\n\nFewer tests have made it difficult for the Afghan government to address the magnitude of the pandemic.\n\n\"We were provided 950 kits for Baghlan province from the Taliban health commission,\" Hijran said, without revealing who provided the kits to the group.\n\nFor civilians like Khairullah though, the Taliban's health initiatives, limited as they might be, provided a much-needed assurance to the people amid the crisis.\n\n\"This virus threatens all of us, whether Taliban or civilians or government,\" he said.","tests":"['135 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Is that enough?","text":"In Ottawa on Wednesday, chief public health officer Dr. Theresa Tam once again stressed the need to flatten the curve of the virus' spread, pointing to a \"sharp rise in cases\" during the past week. \"This is a signal there is some degree of community spread,\" she said. \"Our time to act is now.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday evening, Canada had recorded nearly 730 confirmed and presumptive cases of Covid-19 and nine deaths, including a first death reported in Quebec earlier that day.\n\nThough the numbers are clearly increasing, health experts say it\u2019s hard to know how many cases there actually are in Canada, since not everyone with symptoms is being tested. But they disagree about how much the real numbers matter. Some point out that the available data shows the rate of spread, if not the total number of people infected, and say as long as people with symptoms self-isolate, Canada has a chance to slow transmission of the virus and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed.\n\nOthers counter that people are less likely to self-isolate if they don\u2019t know whether they have Covid-19, and argue it\u2019s much harder to control the virus when you don\u2019t know exactly where it is.\n\nDavid Fisman, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Toronto\u2019s Dalla Lana School of Public Health, said testing is the best way to get control of an epidemic early. By the time people start to die, he said, there have likely been generations of transmission that have gone undetected. \u201cAnd that\u2019s how you get completely hosed by this,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe testing is kind of our eyes and ears in terms of what\u2019s happening. \u2026 I think we\u2019re missing a ton of this stuff.\u201d\n\nFisman said the real number of cases in Canada could be much larger than the number on the books. \u201cWe have the sense that our positives are increasing exponentially,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is what fraction of the true total cases does that represent.\u201d\n\nMoreover, the cases being confirmed today are likely people who got sick a week ago or more, said University of Toronto epidemiologist Dr. Jeff Kwong. \u201cIn an ideal world, we would be testing everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just the reality is we don\u2019t have the resources to do that.\u201d\n\nOttawa\u2019s medical officer of health, Dr. Vera Etches, has warned there could be hundreds of undiagnosed cases in the city, though there is still no proof of community transmission. Fisman said that may well be the case in many Canadian cities.\n\nEven if the confirmed cases are a significant underestimate, though, they still give a sense of the virus\u2019 trajectory, said Dr. Brian Conway, medical director of the Vancouver Infectious Diseases Centre. \u201cI think that as long as we keep doing the same thing \u2026 the numbers from one day to the next are telling us something about how the epidemic is growing,\u201d he said.\n\nCanada is \u201cactually doing a really good job\u201d at testing, given limited resources, said Jason Kindrachuk, assistant professor at the University of Manitoba and Canada Research Chair in emerging viruses. \u201cI don\u2019t think the overall accuracy of the definitive numbers is really important at this stage,\u201d he said, pointing instead to the importance of social distancing and self-isolation to flatten the curve of the virus' spread.\n\nStill, Dr. William Cherniak, an emergency room physician who has been testing patients for Covid-19 for about a month, said the ideal solution would be a test that people could administer themselves. \u201cMy thing is always that knowledge is power,\u201d he said. Self-isolation would be effective \u201cif people really stayed at home for 14 days if they had the symptoms,\u201d he said. But if they haven\u2019t been diagnosed with Covid-19, he believes, they\u2019re less likely to take those instructions seriously.\n\nOn Wednesday, Health Minister Patty Hajdu announced Canada has approved two new diagnostic tests to allow provincial labs to expand testing. \u201cEarly diagnosis is a critical component of slowing down the spread of the illness and Canadians can be encouraged that Canada has been leading in terms of our testing capacity,\u201d she said.\n\nCertainly, Canada has been doing more testing than the U.S., relative to population size. Tam said Wednesday that more than 50,000 people have been tested for Covid-19 in Canada. Meanwhile, the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run accounting of every coronavirus test administered in the U.S., was reporting a total of about 76,000 tests on Wednesday evening, for a population 10 times the size of Canada's. Still, Canada\u2019s efforts don\u2019t compare to the work being done in South Korea, which now has the ability to test up to 20,000 people a day.\n\nWhat many Canadians are watching for these days is whether this country is on the same trajectory as Italy was a few weeks ago, before its hospitals were flooded with patients needing emergency care.\n\nIf Canada has any chance of avoiding that, Kindrachuk said, now is the time to take social distancing seriously, regardless of the exact number of cases. \u201cIt\u2019s the calm before the storm in a lot of ways. We cannot become complacent,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t do anything different, we know where this is going.\u201d","tests":"['76,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The law dates back to 1950 and allows a president to force companies to make products for national defence.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, 3M said the government had invoked the act \"to require 3M to prioritise orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) for our N95 respirators\", and had also requested that 3M import more respirators made in its overseas factories into the US. It said it supported both moves.\n\nHowever, 3M added that the government also requested that it stop exporting respirators made in the US to Canada and Latin America.\n\n\"There are significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators,\" it said.\n\n3M added that such a move \"would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same\", which would lead to the overall number of respirators being made available to the US decreasing.\n\nThe company says it manufactures about 100 million N95 masks per month - about a third are made in the US, and the rest produced overseas.\n\nThe Trump administration has not provided details on its communications with 3M.

The shipment, which included personal protective items for health workers, laboratory screening tests, trauma medication and other medical supplies, will be distributed to Sana\u2019a and Aden to support readiness for COVID-19, as well as the humanitarian response to the ongoing conflict. Earlier on 9 March, Saudi Arabia delivered a shipment of medical equipment to Wuhan city in China.\n\nIn response to an urgent WHO appeal, Saudi Arabia is also donating US$ 10 million to support all countries of the Region in their national COVID-19 response to combat the spread of the disease. An additional US$ 10 million is in the process of being donated to provide WHO Yemen with essential equipment and supplies as part of Yemen\u2019s national readiness and response plan.\n\n\u201cInfectious diseases such as COVID-19 know no borders.

All suspected cases are investigated, particularly at points of entry, and confirmed cases are immediately isolated and treated. The Ministry has designated 25 hospitals, amounting to 80 000 hospital beds and 8000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, for the treatment of COVID-19 cases. 2200 beds have been designated for the isolation of suspected\/quarantined cases.\n\nBased on its experience with other coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, in early January Saudi Arabia developed country-specific guidelines based on WHO guidelines to deal with the new virus. The country is also drawing from its unique expertise in managing mass gatherings and emergency preparedness during the annual hajj pilgrimage.\n\nTo stop the spread of COVID-19, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Ministry of Health is reaching out to the press and the public through all possible outlets, especially on social media. The country has also produced \u2018Your Ultimate Guide to COVID19\u2019 to give citizens and residents access to COVID-19 facts and precautionary messages in 12 languages.

More than 1,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded in Moscow.\"\n\nRussian health officials have warned that a sharp increase in the number of cases in the country is expected in the coming days due to expanded testing in Moscow.\n\nAuthorities in Moscow also closed shopping centers, restaurants, and larger parks from March 28 for at least a week. Moscow authorities have encouraged people to stay home, and begun restricting public transit.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian government has announced it will \u201ctemporarily\u201d close the borders starting on March 30 to curb the spread of the outbreak.\n\nThe measure will not apply to Russian diplomats and the drivers of freight trucks, among others, the government said on March

leader.\n\nOn March 25, Putin postponed next month's referendum on sweeping constitutional changes that could allow him to remain in power until 2036 because of concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nPutin also called for the week between March 28 to April 5 to be a nonworking week -- essentially a weeklong holiday for the country to \"prevent the threat of the quick spread of the illness.\"\n\nThe government also ordered all vacation and health resorts closed until June.\n\nOther restrictions ordered by the government included the cancelation of all international flights.\n\nUzbekistan\n\nLess than 15 days after Uzbekistan detected its first coronavirus infection, the government in Tashkent reported 11 new cases on March 29, bringing the nationwide total to 144.\n\n\n\n\"Another 11 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the country, the total number of infections is 144,\" the press service of the Health Ministry said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe Central

jails.\n\nAuthorities said they would also temporarily free another 15,000 prisoners, bringing the total number released to 100,000.\n\nIran is one of the countries worst hit by the virus, with a declared death toll of 2,640 as of March 29, although experts estimate the total to be much higher.\n\nJudiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told state TV on March 29 that the release of 15,000 more inmates on temporary releases \"had already started.\"\n\nHe said all 100,000 prisoners would be temporarily released until April 19.\n\nOn March 17, Iran said it had freed about 85,000 people from jail temporarily, including political prisoners.\n\nIran said it had 189,500 people in prison, according to a report submitted by the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran to the Human Rights Council in January.\n\nIn recent days there have been several prison riots and mass escapes from prisons, as inmates try to avoid the coronavirus amid substandard prison conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, President Hassan Rohani said \"the new way of life\" in Iran was likely to be prolonged by the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nRohani told a cabinet meeting on March 29, \"We must prepare to live with this virus until a treatment or vaccine is discovered, which has not yet happened to date.\"\n\n\"The new way of life we have adopted\" is to everyone's benefit, he said, adding that \"these changes will likely have to stay in place for some time.\"\n\nTehran on March 25 decided to ban all intercity travel until at least April 8.\n\nWithout an official lockdown in place, the government has repeatedly urged Iranians to stay home \"as much as possible.\"\n\nSchools and universities in some provinces were closed in late February and the closure was later extended to the whole country.\n\nThe reopening of schools following this year's Persian New Year holidays of March 19 to April 3 appears unlikely after Rohani's warning.\n\nIran has refused the United States' offer of humanitarian assistance, saying that Washington should lift sanctions if it wants to help Tehran fight the epidemic.\n\nIran has been under crippling U.S. sanctions in connection with its nuclear and missile program.\n\nKazakhstan\n\nKazakhstan has locked down its fifth major city as part of measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus and will tap into its emergency fund to help alleviate the economic effects of the outbreak, authorities said on March 29.\n\nKaraganda and several of its satellite towns were added to the list after seven cases of the disease were diagnosed in the city on March 29.\n\nThe Central Asian nation has confirmed 265 coronavirus cases and has already locked down its capital, Nur-Sultan, its biggest city, Almaty, as well as Shymkent, a large city in the

tap its $60 billion National Fund for an additional 1.825 trillion tenge ($4.1 billion) this year, Information Minister Dauren Abayev said on March 29.\n\nThe money will help finance Kazakhstan's $10 billion stimulus package aimed at softening the blow from the coronavirus outbreak and the plunge in the price of oil, the Central Asian nation's main export.\n\nArmenia\n\nArmenia has reported two more deaths of patients who had been infected by the coronavirus, raising the Caucasus nation\u2019s total to three fatalities.\n\nArmenia's Health Ministry on March 29 said the total number of confirmed cases has reached 424.\n\nOn March 28, in a Facebook post, Health Minister Arsen Torosian wrote: \u201cI regret to inform you that two deaths have occurred in [Yerevan\u2019s] Nork

multiple medical conditions, including heart disease.\n\nAccording to official data, 30 patients with COVID-19 have recovered in Armenia.\n\nA state of emergency was declared on March 16, set to run until at least April 14.\n\nOn March 25, to further slow the spread of the highly contagious and potentially deadly virus, Armenia\u2019s government introduced a one-week self-isolation regime throughout the country, restricting the movement of citizens.\n\nUnder the order, citizens can leave their homes only for permitted work and for a number of vital reasons, such as the purchase of food and medicine, or to exercise.\n\nTorosian, the health minister, said on March 28 that he did not exclude that the self-isolation period could be extended beyond April 1.\n\nUkraine\n\nUkraine's Health Ministry on March 29 said that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases reached 475, including 10 deaths.\n\nFive people have recovered, Deputy Health Minister and Chief Medical Officer Viktor

reported 308 more confirmed cases of infection with the new coronavirus and two more deaths, bringing the total number of infections to 1,760 and the fatalities to 40.\n\nRomania's crisis group dealing with the outbreak said one of the two victims was a 27-year-old woman who was suffering from diabetes -- the youngest victim so far -- and the other was a 71-year-old man. Both fatalities were from northeastern Romania, where most cases have been identified.\n\nAs of March 29, a total of 21,460 Romanians have been tested.\n\nSome 8,666 people are in quarantine, and 132,641 are in isolation at home under medical supervision.\n\nA total of 12 Romanians died from the coronavirus abroad, eight of them in Italy.

Mohammed Huwais\/Getty Images\n\nSlate is making its coronavirus coverage free for all readers. Subscribe to support our journalism. Start your free trial.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has reached nearly every corner of the globe, one country stands out, for now, as unmarked by the virus. Wrecked by five years of brutal war, Yemen is already home to the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. There are currently no reported cases in the country, which is very fortunate: The coronavirus\u2019s spread in the country would be particularly catastrophic.\n\nDespite that potential disaster scenario, the Trump administration announced on Friday that it is cutting $70 million worth of aid to northern Yemen, where the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis is the most acute. International organizations say this funding could have gone to health programs that Yemenis desperately need. The country\u2019s medical facilities have been routinely attacked during the war between the country\u2019s Saudi-backed government and Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. According to Yemeni government statistics, there are only 700 ICU beds and 500 ventilators in the country for a population of about 30 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big problem as the U.S. was one of the biggest donors,\u201d says Caroline Seguin, Doctors Without Borders deputy program manager for the Middle East. For example, in northern Yemen, there is now no funding to open a COVID-19 treatment center, she said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any money to pay doctors\u2019 salaries, it will be very difficult to open any center that treats the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe official reason for the U.S. cutting is that the Houthis, who control northern Yemen, have been siphoning off food supplies and other aid intended for the Yemeni populace. The move also fits into a strategy employed by the Saudi coalition in its war against the Houthis: limiting the rebels\u2019 resources in order to pressure them into political concessions. Yemeni civilians have suffered as a result, but despite the outcry from human rights groups, the U.S. and U.K. have continued to provide military and logistical support to the Saudi coalition.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi coalition has kicked up a notch over the past few days despite United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 recent call for a global cease-fire so the world can work together to fight COVID-19. The Houthis fired two ballistic missiles at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, over the weekend. Saudi Arabia responded by bombing the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which the Houthis control. The pattern of fighting is consistent with Houthi-Saudi sparring over the past few years as negotiations consistently break down between the two warring sides. While these most recent attacks may only be posturing before the two sides begin negotiations yet again, less promising for a cease-fire is the increase in deadly fighting between the Houthis and Saudi-supported government forces along the border of Houthi territory in Yemen, eastward of the capital.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that even if the fighting were to stop, a COVID-19 outbreak would be catastrophic for millions of very poor, very hungry, and vulnerable people in Yemen, but if it does not stop, it will be far worse,\u201d said Peter Salisbury, Yemen senior analyst at International Crisis Group.\n\nAdditionally, it\u2019s unclear if the country\u2019s beleaguered health system would be able to keep track of COVID-19 even if it had arrived. COVID-19 isn\u2019t the only health crisis Yemen faces. In 2017, the country went through the worst cholera outbreak in modern history, with about 1.2 million cases, and Yemen often seems to be on the brink of a resurgence, while also fighting outbreaks of dengue fever and typhoid.\n\n\u201cIt would be very lucky to have no cases in Yemen, for sure,\u201d said Seguin.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, it has distributed about 1,000 COVID-19 testing kits to medical facilities across Yemen. So far, only suspected cases who have symptoms and a history of exposure are being tested. \u201cIt\u2019s nowhere nearly enough where you could test every suspected case that walks into a hospital,\u201d said Christine Cool, WHO spokesperson in Yemen. Because Yemen hasn\u2019t announced any cases yet, it\u2019s not considered a priority country for receiving more coronavirus-related supplies from WHO.\n\nStill, at the time of a pandemic, Yemen\u2019s isolation may have turned into a strange blessing. Even before COVID-19, Yemen was relatively cut off. Houthi-controlled Yemen received no commercial air travel, and Sanaa\u2019s airport had only been functioning for the past few months. While the Saudi blockade on Houthi territory has led to humanitarian catastrophe, it may have had the unintended consequences of helping keep the coronavirus at bay. Now the Houthis are enforcing a quarantine for any Yemeni entering their territory from government-controlled Yemen, even if the person is just returning home. The conditions of the quarantine are reportedly grim.\n\nEven in the rest of the country, nominally under control of Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government, there were few international commercial flights a day from neighboring countries on the national carrier, Yemenia, and only into two cities, Aden and Seiyoun. These flights were suspended in mid-March, though it is certainly possible that Yemenis traveling home from Cairo, for example, could have brought COVID-19 into the country. In preparation for the virus\u2019s arrival, Yemen\u2019s government has tried to take steps to enforce social distancing by suspending gatherings for Friday prayers and closing markets that sell qat, the mild narcotic that is widely consumed in Yemen, though local reports show that these efforts have not always been obeyed.\n\nThere is one part of Yemen, however, that did receive international travelers prior to the flight suspension: the island Socotra, south of the mainland in the Indian Ocean. Over the past few months, a few dozen tourists, mostly from Europe, have been flying from Cairo to the island each week. So far, there have been no known cases of COVID-19 in Socotra, but given that medical care is quite limited on the far-removed island of 60,000, it could swiftly turn into a coronavirus nightmare if there are cases. There also are no testing kits on Socotra, according to WHO. Swabs would have to be sent to Aden.\n\nI was one of those visitors in early February. I recall being required to complete a medical form upon arrival, attesting that I hadn\u2019t visited China recently. Little did Socotra authorities know that it would have been wiser to ask if I had come from Europe.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['500 ventilators']","beds":"['700 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Save the Children warns","text":"COVID-19: in Gaza, Syria and Yemen fewer than 730 ventilators and 950 intensive care beds for over 15 million children and their families. The fight against coronavirus, therefore, becomes unsustainable\n\nLess than 730 fans and 950 intensive care beds for over 15 million children and their families in the areas most difficult to reach by humanitarian organizations in Yemen, northern Syria and Gaza to fight eventual infection by COVID-19.\n\nThis is the alarm launched today by Save the Children, the international organization that for over 100 years has been struggling to save children at risk in areas where the health care is poor and guarantee them a future. the lack of health facilities in these areas makes them highly unprepared to respond to the spread of COVID-19. The lack of ventilators and intensive care beds is an issue, too.\n\nCoronavirus in areas of crisis\n\nGaza has been under blockade for 13 years, Syria has just entered its tenth year of conflict \u2013 with strong tensions continuing to occur in the north of the country \u2013 and Yemen is in its sixth year of the war, says Save the Children.\n\nIn all three areas, health systems have been severely compromised, and in some cases are now collapsing, and have medical resources that are already unable to respond to current needs and would therefore not be able to face a global pandemic. Intensive care units do not have enough beds to host possible infected people.\n\nIn Syria, at the moment, 9 COVID-19 cases and one death are confirmed, 9 cases of positivity also in Gaza, while Yemen has not yet declared any of them. But there is much tension.\n\nBeds in the intensive care units\n\nIn north-west Syria, the Organization explains, there are a total of 153 fans and 148 intensive care beds, compared to almost one million displaced people living in overcrowded areas and a population of 3 million people, including 1.5 million children.\n\nLikewise, there are fewer than 30 ICU places in northeastern Syria, only ten adult ventilators and one pediatric ventilator, for a population of 1.3 million people, half of whom are children. There are no tampons available across the country.\n\nIn Gaza, one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a high percentage of the population living in refugee camps with limited access to water and other basic services, only 70 beds are available for 2 million people in intensive care and 62 fans.\n\nA worrying scenario that also concerns Yemen, where only half of the hospitals are still fully functional and where 700 intensive care beds are available, including 60 for children, and 500 fans, all for a population of over 30 million people, of which over 12 million are children.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 and humanitarian organizations\n\nThe support of humanitarian organizations to people in need is essential to slow down the spread of COVID-19 in this critical phase, but the possibility of reaching children and their families is often hampered by conflicts, movement restrictions and other problems.\n\nPreventive measures such as social distancing and hand washing are very complicated if not impossible in overcrowded areas such as Gaza and refugee camps in northern Syria.\n\nFurthermore, water sources are often not safe and daily water shortages can occur. In Gaza, for example, 96 per cent of the available water is not clean and many times undrinkable for human consumption.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m most afraid of is that there are so many people in Gaza and we don\u2019t have the means to deal with the virus,\u201d Rafaat *, 13, told Save the Children.\n\n\u201cBecause of this pandemic, we have to stay home and our family is unable to earn anything,\u201d added 11-year-old Jood *.\n\n\u201cI have heard of COVID-19. My family members say it is very dangerous and that if it arrives in Yemen we cannot survive. My mother walks to the well every day for 15 minutes to fill the water container and then takes another 15 minutes to go back.\n\nThe water is not clean, but it is the closest source for us. We use it for cooking, drinking and washing. We try to use it as little as possible, so as not to go out again to pick it up, \u201dsaid Moneer * of Taiz, Yemen.\n\n\u201cIn places where medical care is scarce, prevention is essential. However, measures such as social distancing are extremely difficult in conflict countries.\n\nIn Gaza, for the Palestinians to be able to respect the distance of two meters from each other, the territory should be ten times larger than it currently is; Syrian families living in IDP camps should expand into other tents that are not there, while in Yemen, where about 2 million children suffer from acute malnutrition, the priority is to get food, \u201csaid Jeremy Stoner, Regional Director of Save the Children in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cMany children in Gaza, Syria and Yemen already have worrying health conditions due to a childhood consumed by the war. They risk suffering from malnutrition, being injured or not being vaccinated. The same goes for their parents, many of whom have little or no family support and cannot even afford to get sick. It is literally a matter of life and death to ensure the support needed in these areas for a COVID-19 outbreak to be contained, \u201cadded Stoner.\n\nSave the Children calls on the government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the de facto authorities of Gaza to assume their international responsibilities and guarantee the right to health for children in Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem. Restrictions on the entry of humanitarian and medical aid to Gaza must be lifted and people in need of medical care must have access to it.\n\nThe organization also calls on the parties to the conflict in Syria to observe a complete ceasefire in the northwest, in order to guarantee unhindered humanitarian access to reach people in need. Similarly, even in Yemen, all warring parties must fully implement the recently announced ceasefire to help the country prepare for a possible COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nDue to the closure of international borders, blocking flights and new restrictions on movement, Save the Children is already facing a slowdown in its humanitarian response. In this context, field operators must, therefore, be able to reach people in need with existing humanitarian aid and distribute hygiene products, telephone cards, economic aid without hindrance and conduct awareness-raising sessions for prevention.\n\nSave the Children is strongly committed in Syria, Yemen and Gaza so that projects for children can be carried out. The safety of children, communities and our staff is a top priority and for this, we take all measures to deal with the epidemic. Like other international organizations, we are working on emergency plans to ensure that our work can continue in the area and we are preparing to respond to the needs of children affected by the pandemic.\n\n* the names have been changed to protect the identity of minors","tests":null,"ventilators":"['730 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Start your free trial.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has reached nearly every corner of the globe, one country stands out, for now, as unmarked by the virus. Wrecked by five years of brutal war, Yemen is already home to the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. There are currently no reported cases in the country, which is very fortunate: The coronavirus\u2019s spread in the country would be particularly catastrophic.\n\nDespite that potential disaster scenario, the Trump administration announced on Friday that it is cutting $70 million worth of aid to northern Yemen, where the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis is the most acute. International organizations say this funding could have gone to health programs that Yemenis desperately need. The country\u2019s medical facilities have been routinely attacked during the war between the country\u2019s Saudi-backed government and Iran-aligned Houthi rebels. According to Yemeni government statistics, there are only 700 ICU beds and 500 ventilators in the country for a population of about 30 million.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big problem as the U.S. was one of the biggest donors,\u201d says Caroline Seguin, Doctors Without Borders deputy program manager for the Middle East. For example, in northern Yemen, there is now no funding to open a COVID-19 treatment center, she said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t have any money to pay doctors\u2019 salaries, it will be very difficult to open any center that treats the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nThe official reason for the U.S. cutting is that the Houthis, who control northern Yemen, have been siphoning off food supplies and other aid intended for the Yemeni populace. The move also fits into a strategy employed by the Saudi coalition in its war against the Houthis: limiting the rebels\u2019 resources in order to pressure them into political concessions. Yemeni civilians have suffered as a result, but despite the outcry from human rights groups, the U.S. and U.K. have continued to provide military and logistical support to the Saudi coalition.\n\nMeanwhile, fighting between the Houthis and the Saudi coalition has kicked up a notch over the past few days despite United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 recent call for a global cease-fire so the world can work together to fight COVID-19. The Houthis fired two ballistic missiles at the Saudi capital, Riyadh, over the weekend. Saudi Arabia responded by bombing the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which the Houthis control. The pattern of fighting is consistent with Houthi-Saudi sparring over the past few years as negotiations consistently break down between the two warring sides.

The Houthini rebels opposed to the U.S and Saudi backed government in Yemen have interfered with aid assistance, making it difficult for the US Agency for International Development to know if the aid is being used for legitimate purposes. The decision comes after the U.S has declared a national state of emergency due to COVID-19, which has infected more than 200,000 known U.S citizens.\n\nYemen, a country stuck in one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises, has yet to report any cases of the virus. They are seriously underprepared. If COVID-19 reaches Yemen as aid is cut, it would be a catastrophe for the entire population. Lacking supplies and medical staff, Yemen will likely see people dying at a quicker rate than equipped countries, such as the U.S and Italy who are struggling to keep the curve flattened themselves.\n\nA spokesperson for USAID has said, \u201cThis decision is a last resort. The United States, other donors and international aid organizations have been advocating with the Houthis for years to allow aid groups to operate independently, but we have now reached a point where continued obstruction has made it impossible to ensure aid is reaching those who need it most.\u201d Trump is cutting 70 million in humanitarian aid to the region, leaving about 12 million for lifesaving emergencies.\n\nAccording to slate news, Yemen officials have said they have \u201c700 ICU beds and 500 ventilators to equip a country with a population of about 30 million.\u201d Democrats have highly advised against this current measure until after the crisis, as Yemen is already having trouble delivering basic needs to its citizens. 80% of Yemenis depend on international assistance. An outbreak, which the WHO has warned about in the Middle East, will be fatal and deadly to the Yemen population without essential aid to boost healthcare systems.\n\nAccording to Al-Monitor, Yemen only has 500 tests. More than half the population is malnourished and most hospitals are not accessible due to bombings and the Saudi-blockade. COVID-19 has been a disaster situation in some of the most prepared western countries. If it reaches a country such as Yemen, it will escalate to a point where millions will die.\n\nDemocrats are pushing for a war powers lawsuit against Trump to end the long supported Saudi led coalition under the Trump regime in Yemen. This would make support of this war unconstitutional and US participation would eventually end. The UN recently issued a ceasefire in Yemen, demanding that the war be put on halt during the current crisis, but Houthini rebels seem unfazed. However, as the situation progresses so may international peace. The corona virus has put many disputes at a halt to combat the disease, and it may change the way the world looks at humanitarian crises forever.\n\nThe Houthinis, Iranian lead rebels, have been attempting to overthrow the Saudi-lead government that the U.S has backed. Many anti-war efforts have worked towards bringing this to an end and opening up communication between the two rivals to create negotiations between both sides to end the conflict. However, Trump has taken a very hands-off approach, which has only evolved the escalation of the war as Iranians are getting stronger in the region. Now, they have successfully grown strong enough to block aid. The U.S diplomats need to cease fighting and start making treaties using soft power approaches, as cuts to aid will only merely halt some attacks during this time but could end up killing a huge portion of the population. Iranian forces will persist and potentially create new terrorist threats emerging in the region. Diplomacy is needed now more than ever. Before this proves to be a full-blown crisis once corona virus hits the region. Negotiating now will bring a long-awaited end to the war, which is something that many officials warned should have been dealt with months ago.\n\nIn maintaining international peace with many unstable countries, it is important to create an environment that brings both sides together without neglecting huge populations of people. Thirty million Yemini\u2019s are depending on assistance and healthcare if an outbreak happens. Unless diplomacy is created before an outbreak ravages the population, then we will be unable to stop rebel forces from blockading basic health care facilities and taking supplies.\n\nPeace is the most important aspect of this situation, yet the virus seems to be escalating tension. While the US is seeing an overload in its own healthcare system, this should be a wakeup call for governments to push for peace in the future, as we have seen the devastating impacts worldwide from avoiding long-term issues that could have been solved years ago through diplomacy.\n\nIt is clear now international governments should stop holding off diplomacy and find peaceful solutions to the crisis in Yemen. Best before it is too late to stop an outbreak.\n\nShare this:\n\nTweet\n\nEmail\n\n","tests":"['500 tests']","ventilators":"['500 ventilators']","beds":"['700 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Healthcare systems across all three areas have been decimated, in some cases to the point of paralysis, and have minimal do not have nearly enough medical resources to respond to ongoing needs, let alone a global pandemic. As of March 29, Syria had confirmed 9 COVID-19 cases and one death, Gaza 9 cases, and Yemen is yet to declare any.\n\nIn North West Syria, there are a total of 153 ventilators and 148 beds in ICU, while nearly a million recently displaced people are living in overcrowded areas. In North East Syria, there are fewer than 30 ICU beds, only ten adult ventilators and just one paediatric ventilator.\n\nIn Gaza, there are 70 ICU beds and 62 ventilators for 2 million people. It is also one of the most densely populated areas in the world, with a high proportion of the population living in refugee camps with limited access to water and other basic services.\n\nIn Yemen, where only half of the hospitals are still fully functional, there are 700 ICU beds, including 60 for children, and 500 ventilators.\n\nThe continued support of humanitarian organisations to people in need is vital to slow the spread of coronavirus in this critical phase, but access to children and their families is often hampered by conflict, movement restrictions and other challenges. Preventive measures such as social distancing and hand washing are difficult if not impossible in overcrowded areas like Gaza and displacement camps in Northern Syria. Water sources are unreliable across all three locations, and shortages can occur daily. In Gaza, 96 percent of the available water is unsuitable for human consumption.\n\nChildren in Gaza told Save the Children about their fear. Raafat*, 13, said: \u2018What I\u2019m most afraid of is that Gaza is highly populated and doesn\u2019t have enough resources to face the virus.\u2019 Jood, 11, said: \u2018This pandemic affects us, because we have to stay home and there is no income for the family.\u2019\n\nIn Yemen, Moneer*, 17, from Taiz said: \u2018I have heard about Corona. People in my family said that it was very dangerous and we wouldn\u2019t survive it if it came to Yemen. Every day, my mother walks for 15 minutes to the well to fill the container with water and then walks back for another 15 minutes. The water doesn\u2019t look clean, but it is the nearest source for us. We use it for cooking, drinking, and washing. We try to use as little as possible so we don\u2019t have to go fetch it again.\u2019\n\nJeremy Stoner, Save the Children's Regional Director, said: \u2018In places where medical care is scarcely available, prevention is critical. Yet measures like social distancing are hugely challenging in countries in conflict. If people need to stay two metres apart, for Palestinians living in Gaza to comply with this, the territory would have to be ten times larger than it currently is; for Syrians living in displacement camps, families would need to spread out in numerous tents currently unavailable; and for Yemenis, of whom about 2 million children suffer from acute malnutrition, the priority would be getting food.'\n\nMany children in Gaza, Syria, and Yemen suffer from pre-existing health concerns caused by childhoods consumed with war. They will be malnourished, injured, or will not have been properly vaccinated. The same is true for their parents, many of whom have little or no family support and cannot afford to become ill. It is literally a matter of life and death to support these areas in their efforts to contain a COVID-19 outbreak,\u2019 he added.\n\nSave the Children is calling on the Government of Israel, the Palestinian Authority and the de-facto authorities in Gaza to uphold their international responsibilities by ensuring the right to health is fully provided to children in the West Bank including Jerusalem, and Gaza. Restrictions on humanitarian and medical relief items entering Gaza must be lifted, and people in need of medical care must be afforded access to it.\n\nWe are also calling on warring parties in Syria to observe a complete ceasefire in the North West to allow for the full and unhindered access to people in need. In Yemen, all warring parties must fully and truly implement the recently announced ceasefire to help the country prepare for a COVID-19 outbreak. As an aid agency, Save the Children is already facing a slowdown in its response because of closure of international borders, grounding of flights, and new limitations to movements in country.

{"country":"Nepal","publish_date":null,"url":"https:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2020\/04\/nepal-cannot-fight-coronavirus-alone\/","title":"Nepal Cannot Fight Coronavirus Alone","text":"Advertisement\n\nCompared to other South Asian countries, the spread of the novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, in the Himalayan nation Nepal has been relatively modest to date. The first instance of the virus was reported in the country on January 24, and the second case in the third week of March. Soon after the second case was reported, the Nepal government enacted a week-long lockdown across the country. Kathmandu is operating under the reality that if the virus spreads, Nepal may not be equipped to handle it. The first lockdown expired on March 30 and has been extended.\n\nAs the number of coronavirus cases gradually increases, it\u2019s clear the government has made some mistakes. When the virus was spreading rapidly in other countries, Nepal did not impose travel restrictions. Meanwhile, visitors to Nepal did not all strictly follow government requests that they self-quarantine for 14 days and the government did little to follow up with travelers to ensure compliance. A ban on international flights was only imposed in the third week of March and subsequently the border with India was closed.\n\nIf case numbers swell, observers say it would be very difficult for Nepal to fight the coronavirus alone due to its limited resources and fragile healthcare system. The Nepali healthcare system is not fully prepared to deal with a large-scale pandemic that is straining healthcare systems even in developed countries.\n\nLocal governments in Nepal, which have a key role in contact tracing and treatment, are facing a serious resource crunch and have been slow to act.\n\nNepal only recently adopted a federal system. The previous centralized structures have crumbled, but new effective mechanisms are not all in place. There is a lack of coordination among the three tiers of government: federal, provincial, and local. According to Dr. Sushil Nath Pyakurel, former director general of the Department of Health Services under the Ministry of Health and Population, there was a robust chain of command from center to the grassroots, which was broken after the country adopted the federal structure two years ago.\n\n\u201cFirst, the federal government has failed to properly manage human resources. The adjustment of civil servants has not been completed even in over three years; there is either over- or under-staffing. Second, management of logistics and infrastructure has been faulty. Third, there is lack of effective coordination and information sharing-system among three-tier of government,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are not sufficient resources and manpower for the massive testing and treatment of people that may be needed. Testing facilities are concentrated in Kathmandu valley, with a capacity to test just 30-40 people in a single day. To date, only about a thousand people have been tested. That said, the government has started to set up testing labs in other regions of the country. Still, there is a lack of sufficient manpower and logistics for testing. There is not a specific agency to deal with the pandemic, such as the Centers for Disease Control that exist in some countries, nor has Nepal done any long-term planning to deal with a pandemic.\n\nWhen last time Nepal faced a serious crisis \u2014 the earthquake of 2015 \u2014 the international community rushed to offer support. But with this crisis, the powerful and well-resourced countries that had previously assisted Nepal in its hour of need are themselves facing the same crisis. They are not in the same position to offer assistance. Nevertheless, some countries \u2014 such as the United States and Germany \u2014 have announced monetary assistance to Nepal to fight the coronavirus. However, Nepal desperately needs further support for basic needs such as testing kits, personal protective equipments (PPE), and other medicines.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonations from China\u2019s Sichuan province and the Chinese Embassy in Kathmandu include different kinds of masks, thermometers, chloroquine phosphate tablets, protective clothing, and portable ventilators weighing 1.1 tons, according to Chinese media. Similarly, donations from the Alibaba Foundation and Jack Ma Foundation include 100,200 N95 masks and 20,064 test kits weighing 1.4 tons, according to media. The Nepal government has also purchased relevant goods from China.\n\nIndia, so far, has not announced any medical assistance but media reports say that Delhi is ready to send a rapid response team to Nepal. According to The Hindu, \u201cArmy medical teams and two Indian Navy ships were on standby to provide required assistance to friendly countries in the neighborhood.\u201d In 2015, after the earthquake, India was the first country to send rescue teams followed by China, the United States, and others. In this crisis, India is not in a position to send largescale medical logistics and equipment because of its own domestic needs.\n\nIn the past, big countries used to compete in providing assistance to Nepal; this crisis is different in that all countries are facing their own domestic troubles too. For example, in 2015 India and China competed with each other to announce ever bigger assistance packages. To date, the United States has announced it would provide $1.8 million to fight the coronavirus in Nepal. Earlier, the United States provided some personal protective equipment. Germany has announced that it is enhancing its existing health program in Nepal with an extra 1 million euro grant to respond to emergency situations related to COVID-19.\n\nDue to an open border, there is a need for strong collaboration between Nepal and India to fight the coronavirus. Approximately 1 million Nepali migrant workers are in India. Due to the the 21-day lockdown enacted by the Indian government, Nepali migrant workers are returning to Nepal and hundreds are stranded along the border area. The Nepal government has decided to allow them to return with the condition that they live in quarantine for 14 days. However, some of those who returned in the past are violating the isolation directive. Due to the open border, it is very difficult to restrict the movement of people.\n\nDiplomat Brief Weekly Newsletter N Get first-read access to major articles yet to be released, as well as links to thought-provoking commentaries and in-depth articles from our Asia-Pacific correspondents. Subscribe Newsletter\n\nSimilarly, Nepal is heavily dependent on India for essential supplies, including medicines. If lockdown in India results in the interruption of supply chains, Nepal will obviously face difficulties.\n\nRegional organizations such as the South Asian Association for Regional Coordination (SAARC) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) are arguably in a position to coordinate and provide support to member countries. But both organizations are now almost obsolete.\n\nOn March 15, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference with SAARC members proposing a common strategy to fight the coronavirus. In the same meeting, Modi proposed the establishment of a fund to help support countries in their fight with the virus, but the move has not progressed far enough. Other countries have announced that they would contribute to the SAARC fund, but Pakistan held back. Lately, Pakistan has proposed to keep the COVID-19 emergency find under the SAARC Secretary General, but other member countries have not reacted to the proposal. Sar far, BIMSTEC has not taken any measures to collectively fight the coronavirus.\n\nSmall developing countries like Nepal, hamstrung by resource constrains and fragile healthcare systems, cannot fight the coronavirus alone. Bigger, wealthier, and more developed countries, despite their own constraints, and regional organizations are in a position to lend support to smaller countries.\n\nKamal Dev Bhattarai is Kathmandu-based writer and journalist.","tests":"['20,064 test kits']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['100,200 N95 masks']"}
{"country":"Nepal","publish_date":null,"url":"https:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2020\/03\/coronavirus-geopolitics-and-nepal-between-great-powers\/","title":"Coronavirus, Geopolitics, and Nepal Between Great Powers","text":"Advertisement\n\nStuck between two emerging powers, China and India, Nepal finds itself in a tight spot geopolitically. The existing powers perceive the Himalayan country as having a difficult choice to make between China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the United States\u2019 Indo-Pacific Strategy. Although Nepal already made a statement by signing a BRI agreement with China on May 12, 2017, the controversy surrounding U.S. engagement in Nepal persists. The issue here is that the great powers continue to make moves based on hackneyed interpretations of the Himalayan nation\u2019s interests.\n\nSince the signing of BRI, Nepal and China\u2019s relationship has only grown stronger, while its southern neighbor India is trying to mend its 2015 mistakes \u2014 such as the imposition of an economic blockade after Delhi disapproved of Nepal\u2019s promulgated constitution. Why does India\u2019s relationship with Nepal matter for the success or failure of the Indo-Pacific Strategy? This is simply because the United States has handed the baton of overseeing the South Asian region to India for a long period of time now \u2013 and to make this clearer U.S. President Donald J. Trump approved this in his recent India visit. This move to use India to manage other South Asian countries, however, hasn\u2019t gone well for the struggling superpower.\n\nIn a recent article, Alyssa Ayres of the Council of Foreign Relations says that \u201cThe Indo-Pacific framework inherently places India at the heart.\u201d On the other hand, the U.S. Embassy in Nepal and the incumbent U.S. ambassador to Nepal have continuously put forward the rhetoric that the United States doesn\u2019t see Nepal from the eyes of India. American officials in Washington D.C. and those visiting Nepal have given a completely different version of this, stating that the Indo-Pacific is the United States\u2019 strategy to deal with Nepal. These divergent statements not only confuse policymakers and critics within Nepal, but also pit the Indian administration against the United States. Unlike Ayres, who argues for trusting India more, I argue that the United States needs to deal with Nepal on a face-to-face basis if it desires to keep China at bay. However, with the emergence of the BRI and Nepal\u2019s tilt toward China, this is unlikely.\n\nNepal is a young federal democracy and although its government is now stable, it is a communist one. The United States has a slight advantage over China to reap fruit from it, simply because Nepal still adheres to a democratic state structure. This was evident in the recent call by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to reignite the slumbering South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on March 25. At that meeting, Modi proposed a $10 million fund and a number of other initiatives to combat the coronavirus pandemic. Nepali Prime Minister K.P. Oli, meanwhile, pledged $1 million on March 20 during his live telecast address to the nation. This sudden cooperation is lauded by many, with the hope that perhaps SAARC will come to life again.\n\nMeanwhile, with China bringing the coronavirus outbreak under control, it has now reached out to Nepal, India, and other as many as 10 other Eurasian and South Asian countries as of March 20 to help out these nations in their respective fight against the virus. Nepal has already provided a list of items it needs to China on their request. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba Group, also tweeted on March 21 that they are providing 1.8 million masks, 210,000 test kits, 36,000 protective suits, plus ventilators and thermometers to Nepal, Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. All these developments only suggest that China is in no mood to lose to the United States.\n\nBut the United States was ahead of both India and China in helping out Nepal. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided personal protective equipment (PPE) to the Nepal government on March 6 and also assisted the Nepal Army on February 18, with seven sets of medical personal protection equipment, 400 sets of latex gloves, and 110 biohazard bags to evacuate Nepali students from Wuhan city, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. The United States also pledged $1.8 million in assistance to Nepal on March 19 for its fight against the virus. In this sense, the geopolitical picture is clear.\n\nDespite the United States playing a key role in assisting Nepal\u2019s democratic institutions to flourish through various assistance programs, geopolitics and geopolitical distance come to make a difference. Like in the past, the U.S. administration continues to tackle Nepal through the lens of India \u2013 which, in itself, is problematic to Nepali policymakers, analysts, and even the Nepali people. The outcome of the coronavirus outbreak and the help of India, China, and the United States toward Nepal will manifest in its future and in how the country responds to the geopolitical competition as the global economy is hit and a landlocked nation like Nepal largely depends on India and China. A temporarily closed border on the south will, of course, prove an advantage to China, and a disappointment for India.","tests":"['210,000 test kits']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

It has offered temporary work permits to more than 415,000 Venezuelans and given them access to already strained emergency medical services.\n\nBut the pandemic is testing the limits of the region\u2019s largesse.\n\nWhile Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and others are rolling out financial aid programs to help their most vulnerable citizens amid the lockdown, those benefits don\u2019t extend to migrants, who are often undocumented.\n\nWhen Colombia announced its quarantine, thousands of informal workers, many of them Venezuelans, protested in the capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re worried that migrants are going to become invisible in this crisis,\u201d said Juan Viloria, the coordinator for Coalici\u00f3n por Venezuela, an association of groups that work on behalf of the Venezuelan diaspora. \u201cCountries are taking care of their own, which is understandable. But Venezuela, which should be taking care of its citizens inside and outside of the country, is not doing it, because the regime is more worried about staying in power than saving people\u2019s lives. ...

The nation is highly reliant on oil sales to stay afloat, but a combination of crashing crude prices, widespread corruption and U.S. sanctions have gutted the economy. While human rights organizations are asking Washington to lift sanctions during the pandemic, the Trump administration is doubling down, indicting Maduro and some of his closest allies last week on drug trafficking and terrorism charges \u2014 further complicating the government\u2019s ability to get outside financing.\n\nA man wearing plastic bags as gloves as a precaution amid the spread of the new coronavirus rides the subway in Caracas, Venezuela, Monday, March 30, 2020. Ariana Cubillos AP\n\nBy all accounts, Venezuela is woefully unprepared to handle the pandemic. Its hospitals often struggle to keep water running and the electricity on. By some counts the entire country of 32 million has fewer than 90 ICU beds. When the United Nations launched a $2 billion COVID-19 appeal last week, it singled out Venezuela, Haiti and Venezuela\u2019s more than 4 million refugees and migrants being hosted by Latin America and Caribbean nations as being in most desperate need of help.\n\nCarrie Fipiletti, the deputy assistant secretary for Cuba and Venezuela in the U.S. State Department\u2019s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said Venezuela\u2019s shortcomings will likely have a regional impact.\n\n\u201cIf Venezuela is not able to address the challenges it faces with controlling COVID-19, then going into the future [we\u2019ll see it] going into Brazil and Colombia and the surrounding region,\u201d she said during a conference hosted by the Americas Society\/Council of the Americas. \u201cJust as we have seen with the refugee crisis, we will too see an expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday, Venezuela had reported 135 cases of the coronavirus and three deaths, but health experts say the actual number is likely much higher. Colombia, by comparison, has reported 798 cases and 14 deaths.\n\nDaphne Panayotatos, an advocate and program coordinator with Refugees International, a nonprofit, said that the pandemic threatens to shove refugee and migration issues into the background, even as those populations are some of the most vulnerable.\n\nA report issued by the group this week found that migrants like Beli Fonseca often live in cramped conditions with little access to healthcare, basic sanitation and the information they need to stay safe.\n\n\u201cViruses don\u2019t recognize borders, they don\u2019t discriminate between migrants, refugees and citizens,\u201d Panayotatos said. \u201cWe are only as strong as the least healthy person of our society.\u201d\n\nIn that sense, caring for migrants \u201cis not just morally right, it\u2019s the smart thing to do,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile Colombia has declared a moratorium on evictions during the health emergency, that\u2019s not being respected. Viloria said his organization is tracking at least 50 Venezuelan families who have been thrown out of their homes for not paying rent.\n\nBeli Fonseca said she\u2019s trying to stay calm and wait for the quarantine to lift so she can get back to work. Despite the depth of her hardships, she has no intention of returning to Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThey are even worse off there than we are here,\u201d she said. \u201cEven when you can find food there is no way to make enough money to buy it. ... Things were ugly there when I left, and that was before the coronavirus.\u201d","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['90 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

They are not, as the regime tries to promote, areas that can be solved separately. Nor could one hand over financial or other resources to a dictator who steals everything in his path: a power that has demonstrated its criminal nature.\n\nIt is not possible to face the pandemic without facing the dictator. And this, in essence, because the absolute responsibility for the Venezuelan debacle lies with Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. At this time, when contagion is spreading across the country, the dictatorship and the pandemic constitute for Democrats a single and simultaneous objective.\n\nBoth health systems, public services and the oil industry have been destroyed and looted by the regime. The country, which due to its population should have at least 100,000 hospital beds, does not reach 15,000. In other words, the capacity is today well below the minimum necessary 20%. Even more alarming, is the data on the availability of ICUs with mechanical respirators: only 84 in the public sector and 120 in the private sector. Just 200 units to respond to a disease that attacks the functioning of the lungs and if it were to affect half the population as estimated in most countries, at least 150,000 intensive care services will be required.\n\nThe narco-dictatorship has turned the pandemic into its human shield\n\nThe complaints and testimonies of doctors, paramedics, unions and hospital users are unanimous: the Venezuelan hospital system is in ruins. Many do not have water -read well: hospitals without water-, the most basic and essential resource for health action and the basic input for the basic recommendation: washing hands. In most of them, electric service failures are recurring \u2013 read correctly: hospitals without electricity. All, absolutely all, lack the basic minimum supplies to care for patients and to protect health professionals. There are no gowns, caps, gloves, masks, supplies of alcohol, soap and other items to avoid the rapid spread of infections. There are no medications \u2013 read it well: hospitals without medications. There are no disinfectants. The only resource they have is the will of health workers, who right now are wondering how they will save the lives of the sick, when most have difficulty reaching their health center due to lack of fuel. that has paralyzed the country in recent days. It has been the policies spearheaded by Maduro that have created this hecatomb.\n\nThe concern that prompts me to write this article does not stem solely from the catastrophe of the public health system. At the center of our anguish is the growth of precariousness, the most marked deterioration in the living conditions of the vast majority of Venezuelans. We have the Democrats of Venezuela and the world, who press the alarm button, when we read that less than 7% of the population has constant drinking water, and that almost 18% never receive it. We must press the alarm button when we read that less than 10% receive constant electrical service. We must raise our voices in all scenarios, to say that only 6% of the population has guaranteed access to the food necessary to live. It is necessary to do the unspeakable to attract the attention of the world, to warn that, right now, less than 1% have access to fuel. I repeat: the sole responsibility for the almost non-existence of public services and fuel lies with the dictator.\n\nWe must act without delay to prevent the disease from sweeping the country\n\nI must add that, in our country, 87% of families do not have the money to allow them to stay at home without going out on the streets in search of sustenance. Not a day. They do not have food in their cupboards, nor disinfectants, nor soap, nor water \u2013 I insist on it. At least two thirds have a biological age that does not correspond to the actual time of life: their bodies have aged, due to hunger, diseases and the conditions in which they live. A malnourished body is a fertile field for the virus.\n\nThe first wave of Covid-19, which had its epicenter in the Asian region, taught the precious role that information plays as a barrier to disease. The second wave, in full swing in Europe, has tested the response capabilities of governments and health systems. This is its main lessons. The third wave, of which Venezuela is part, has its main foci in Latin America and Africa, where the spread of the virus could exceed the worst forecasts. A third wave that is just beginning and that the WHO has recommended to developing countries to \u201cprepare for the worst\u201d.\n\nWhat actions has the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro dictatorship taken to respond to the action of Covid-19? First, make jokes and minimize danger and create a false expectation of control. Then lie: affirm, with arrogance, that the Government has all the necessary resources. Then, take advantage of the situation, to ask your reviled International Monetary Fund for $ 5 billion. Subsequently, militarizing the country and turning the sale of fuel into a -another- gigantic network of corruption and political controls, and most seriously, the repression has intensified, imprisoning doctors and journalists who have dared to speak out, thus like many members of President Guaid\u00f3\u2019s close team, whose persecution has become more intense during the pandemic. No one can be misled: the narco-dictatorship has turned the coronavirus into its human shield, into its tool, into the excuse it needed to prolong the usurpation, increasing social control and repression.\n\nAn emergency government may enable the necessary resources\n\nMaduro has fused with the virus. They are the same entity, to which it is not possible to grant a truce. It must be fought in all areas, without rest. We have a responsibility to act without delay to prevent the pandemic from devastating Venezuela. The Interim Government, under the leadership of President Juan Guaid\u00f3, has proposed a route for the solution:\n\n1. Form a National Emergency Government with representation from all sectors of the country. In order for it to be in line with our Constitution and to fully reintegrate into the international community, it cannot be conducted by defendants with charges of drug trafficking or terrorism, or by human rights violators.\n\n2. To delegate to the Council of State the executive powers to attend the emergency, until the holding of free presidential elections.\n\n3. Once the Emergency Government is established, the sanctions will be gradually lifted.\n\n4. Strengthen the presence and capacity for action of international humanitarian and human rights agencies in Venezuelan territory.\n\n5. To approve a Law of Guarantees that generates the mechanisms to guarantee national stability and the care and reparation of victims.\n\n6. Execute a national emergency plan with international humanitarian and financial support that allows hospitals to be provided with medical supplies, humanitarian food aid, direct subsidies for the most vulnerable population, import of gasoline and gas to supply the country, and facilitate access to water, among other priorities.\n\n7. Hold free elections in a period not exceeding 6 to 12 months, essential to resolve the political crisis and resume the constitutional and democratic thread of Venezuela.\n\nThis proposal is inclusive, enjoys broad support from the international community, and is aimed at all sectors, both the democratic sectors and those who make life within the Venezuelan State, particularly in the military sphere, and even those who, being from the circle close to the dictator and realizing that he is lost, decide to avoid further trauma to our people in exchange for some benefits that international justice has agreed to give.\n\nThe proposal has received prompt support from the United States and from countries in Europe and Latin America, which now total 47 countries. That emergency Government will be able to enable, very quickly, the necessary financial resources and the help of international agencies for the enormous task that would have to be addressed.\n\nBut, I must insist on this, it is a single fight: against that unique and murderous entity that makes up the dictatorship and the pandemic.\n\nLeopoldo L\u00f3pez, Venezuelan politician, imprisoned in 2014, since April 2019 has been protected at the Spanish Embassy in Caracas.

(Jon Chol Jin \/ Associated Press)\n\nThe lack of free media and scant independent monitoring make it nearly impossible to vet the official account. Yet many outside observers and officials have questioned the country\u2019s claim, alleging the regime of Kim Jong Un may be suppressing information or willfully blind to potential local outbreaks because it lacks the capacity to conduct widespread diagnostic testing.\n\nWith a poorly equipped medical system ravaged by sanctions in recent years, the country has struggled with a population susceptible to infection, widespread malnutrition and inadequate sanitation. An outbreak of the coronavirus may be an impending disaster, former North Korean health professionals and outside experts say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t trust North Korean statistics,\u201d said Choi Jung-hun, who worked for a decade as a physician in North Korea before escaping in 2011. \u201cThe epidemic really plainly shows the nature of the North Korean regime. ... The regime\u2019s face saving is more important than citizens\u2019 health or life.\u201d\n\nIn fact, North Korea was one of the first countries in the world to take swift action as the coronavirus began spreading in China. It closed its borders to foreign tourists in January, around the same time China imposed travel restrictions in Wuhan. It imposed strict, lengthy quarantines on foreign diplomats and canceled virtually all international flights. More than 10,000 of its citizens were placed under isolation or travel restrictions as measures against the virus.\n\nNagi Shafik, a public health advisor and a former project manager for the World Health Organization in North Korea, said the early drastic steps indicated how cognizant the government was of the threat that an epidemic could pose to its stability.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have reagents to diagnose cases. They don\u2019t have protective equipment. If I were them, I would do the same thing, this is the only thing I have. To close borders with China, this is the lifeline for them. It shows you how desperate they were.\u201d\n\nBut as much as North Korea\u2019s authoritarian system is able to impose severe restrictions on its citizens\u2019 movements, the virus is likely to make it into the country at some point if it hasn\u2019t already, he said.\n\n\u201cSooner or later something will spill over,\u201d said Shafik, who last visited the country in 2019 to consult on a humanitarian mission. \u201cWhatever you try, everywhere in the world, some people go through the borders without being noticed.\u201d\n\nPeople wear masks on a bus in Pyongyang.

When an illness began spreading in the country\u2019s northern region around 2006, officials mistook it for scarlet fever for more than two months before finding out that it was, in fact, measles, he recalled.\n\nIn the absence of testing, patients would die from symptoms matching an infectious disease without doctors ever getting confirmation of what the person was sick with, according to Choi. Many patients simply turned to antibiotics across the board, creating drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis or typhus, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s proper treatment even if people are diagnosed,\u201d Choi said. \u201cThe basic infrastructure like electricity and water isn\u2019t a guarantee even at medical clinics. Medical supplies and equipment are antiquated.\u201d\n\nIn mid-February, North Korea quietly reached out to international organizations and nonprofits requesting assistance such as diagnostic test kits, protective gear and equipment, including ventilators and oxygenators. Russia in late February sent 1,500 coronavirus test kits to North Korea at its request, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry.\n\nA health worker takes a woman\u2019s temperature at an entrance of the Pyongchon District People\u2019s Hospital in Pyongyang.

Many North Koreans heavily rely on a network of unofficial markets, much of which is supplied by trade from China. For months before the coronavirus outbreak, many working on humanitarian assistance to North Korea had warned of food shortages in the country exacerbated by drought and international sanctions imposed in response to its weapons tests.\n\n\u201cThis was a massive decision, with huge implications not just for the people but for the state economy,\u201d said Kee B.

Health care is normally provided by the provinces there, but after the SARS outbreak, the federal government established an agency to coordinate and help finance testing and treatment during any kind of viral or disease outbreak.\n\nA national laboratory was expanded to become the clearinghouse for tests, which are conducted in some provinces by local authorities.\n\nAs in Australia, all medical tests are free under Canada\u2019s public health system, and on Thursday morning, a lawmaker with responsibilities for federal health care told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that there were currently enough test kits for 16,000 patients.\n\nSo far, Canada has 103 confirmed cases and has performed 642 tests.\n\nIn the United States, little if anything about the process has been efficient or convenient. Tests have been slow to arrive across the country, in part because of a manufacturing problem, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","tests":"['642 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

State officials said the virus may have been transmitted in the Bondi community via a backpacker unaware of having the disease.\n\nQantas Airways Ltd said on Tuesday that six baggage handlers at Adelaide airport have tested positive for the virus, adding that other employees who had come into contact with the infected staff would self-isolate.\n\nSlideshow (24 Images)\n\nLike many countries, Australia\u2019s financial and jobs markets have been roiled by the outbreak, prompting the government to unveil several stimulus packages.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said 113,000 businesses had registered for a A$130 billion ($80 billion) six-month wage subsidy designed to stop spiraling unemployment and business closures.\n\nThe \u201cjob keeper\u201d allowance has brought the country\u2019s coronavirus-related stimulus so far to A$320 billion, or about 15% of Australia\u2019s gross domestic product, as economists forecast the country\u2019s first recession in almost three decades.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['5,000 ventilators']","beds":"['34,000 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

Hospitals care for critically ill patients every day but not in the numbers or at the scale that has become globally associated with Covid-19.\n\nGuardian Australia interviewed health workers around the country, from densely populated cities such as Melbourne, up to remote communities in the Torres Strait, about how they are preparing for a potential influx of patients requiring treatment for the highly contagious disease.\n\nThe general public and the community can save more lives than intensive care will be able to Chris MacIsaac\n\nThe approach hospitals are taking varies based on geography and the volume of resources and clinicians they have to call on.

First, significantly boost the production of Australia\u2019s only onshore manufacturer of ventilators, a company named Resmed.\n\nSecond, activate all reserves of ventilators that exist in Australia, including those currently being used in veterinary clinics. Third, purchase more ventilators from overseas suppliers, like Draeger, a German company.\n\nAnd finally, set up arrangements for new domestic manufacturers to utilise existing ventilator designs held by overseas manufacturers, already approved by foreign regulators, to begin producing the machines or parts in Australia.\n\nAustralia's major measures to tackle coronavirus are now in place, Scott Morrison says Read more\n\nThere is confidence from members of the taskforce that this will be enough to meet even the worst-case scenarios.\n\nBut adequate supply of ventilators is not the only problem. The Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association\u2019s chief executive, Alison Verhoeven, says the issue will be ensuring the machines are deployed in a way that maximises their coverage of the population.\n\n\u201c[It will be about] having smart plans in place to shift patients out of areas where there might not be ventilators available \u2013 and I\u2019m thinking rural and regional areas \u2013 to centralised facilities,\u201d Verhoeven told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the planning that state health departments have been doing and each of them will have slightly different responses.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, access to PPE \u2013 masks, gowns, goggles, and gloves \u2013 remains a risk to hospital preparedness. Adequate PPE is critical to safely treating Covid-19 patients.

Core areas \u2013 emergency, theatres, intensive care \u2013 have been arranged so they are close together, the goal being to minimise contact between Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe ICU is being separated and expanded to 45 beds for Covid-19 patients and 21 for critically ill non-Covid patients. There\u2019s capacity to increase that by another 10, with 40 to 50 ventilators.\n\nCoordinating a response to a 24\/7 emergency is complex and several people need to contribute. Doctors and nurses, cleaners, supply and logistics teams, caterers. Strategies have had to be developed to help Covid-19 patients, who can receive no visitors, communicate with their loved ones.\n\nEverything before a pandemic seems like an overreaction and everything after seems like an underreaction Dr Bruce Ashford\n\nAt the same time, the day-to-day running of the health service continues and the impact of every decision on other, smaller, hospitals in the region has to be weighed.\n\n\u201cThe whole effort is based around this idea that everything before a pandemic seems like an overreaction and everything after seems like an underreaction,\u201d Ashford says.\n\nHe says one advantage in Australia\u2019s favour is that the health system has been able to observe and learn from the experience in other countries. This week, the health minister, Greg Hunt, announced an extra $1.3bn towards integrating the private hospital system into the Covid-19 response.\n\n\u201cHowever, does that mean our efforts are going to be adequate? Probably not,\u201d Ashford says.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that there\u2019s something so special about Australia that we\u2019re going to be different to the rest of the world.\n\n\u201cYou look at New York, Milan and Madrid, they are on their last legs. And you think, what would that be like for us?\u201d\n\nA hospital committee including a medical ethicist and senior clinicians is discussing what will be done in the event there are more critically ill patients than resources or ventilators to care for them. There are similar committees, or frameworks, looking at this dilemma in other health districts around the country.\n\nAshford says if it gets to that stage, extremely tough decisions will be inevitable and there will be frank conversations with patients and families about their wishes, as well the constraints on the hospital.\n\nThe two meetings that changed the trajectory of Australia's coronavirus response Read more\n\nSara Arcioni, a senior registrar in the hospital\u2019s ICU, says frontline workers are used to the emotional load that comes with treating critically ill patients.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that we may be dealing with many more,\u201d she says.\n\nThe nation\u2019s capital\n\nAround the country, plans are being drawn up for how hospitals could increase their capacity beyond their existing facilities.\n\nImportant regional facilities like Wagga Wagga base hospital have increased ICU capacity and set up procedures to separate the flow of suspected patients, while in Sydney, the Royal Prince Alfred hospital has prepared a dedicated and specially-designed Covid-19 intensive care unit.\n\nMajor hotels, already being used as quarantine zones for returned travellers, could be converted into wards. In Victoria, the government is developing plans to convert the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition centre into a hospital and morgue.\n\nIn Canberra this week, the ACT government announced it was working with healthcare company Aspen Medical to rapidly build a temporary emergency department for moderately to severely ill Covid-19 patients.\n\nIt is also setting up an unregistered workforce made up of volunteers from the community \u2013 academics, students and a range of people with health backgrounds \u2013 after issuing a callout.

It\u2019s hot and there\u2019s a risk of dehydration. The greatest physical burden is often borne by nurses who have the most direct contact with patients.\n\nBernadette McDonald, the chief executive of Canberra Health Services, said considerable time was being spent on staff welfare and support for workers who might be feeling anxiety.\n\nSome major Australian hospitals have been expanding their existing staff support services by bringing in additional psychologists and social workers, and organisations that will supply meals and nutrition for frontline teams.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time they are the most important people because they\u2019re the people who care for everyone that gets sick,\u201d McDonald says.\n\nThe regions\n\nIn Emerald in Queensland\u2019s central highlands a rural fever clinic has been built out of four dongas, each consisting of two rooms, a shower and toilet.\n\nOnly a week ago, the site was empty space next to the practice run by GP and obstetrician Ewan McPhee, who is also the president of the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The new pop-up coronavirus clinic in Emerald, Central Queensland.

McPhee says medical teams in Emerald were having to consider solutions such as managing some hospital patients in their homes.\n\nSome very unwell patients would need to be transferred by helicopter or with the Royal Flying Doctor Service to Rockhampton or Brisbane.\n\nIf the town becomes overrun, they would have to either convert the clinic into a treatment space, or call on the military to establish a field hospital.\n\nMcPhee said there was enormous pressure on rural health workers who would have \u201cnowhere to hide\u201d in the face of such an emergency and he feels the urgency of the situation has not been fully grasped.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the community that has to make the decision about their future.

There have been no confirmed Covid-19 cases so far and much of the health strategy is focused on trying to keep the disease out of the community. There is a 14-day quarantine requirement for travellers to the islands.\n\nIf a doctor or nurse suspects a patient has coronavirus, that person has to isolate themselves at home.

That means every four days the number of cases has been roughly double what it was four days prior. We would calculate it takes about three months for one infection doubling every four days to cause 15 million infections.

He could watch on, helpless, as the local car manufacturing industry fell apart around him, or he could put his skills to better use.\n\nBowtell used his redundancy payout to set up a 3D printing facility in a small warehouse on Victoria\u2019s Bass coast, where he began manufacturing free prosthetic hands for children with a disability.\n\nNow, as Covid-19 fractures the economy and brings entire industries to their knees, Bowtell\u2019s skills have again found a new purpose.\n\nFourteen of his 20 3D printers are now being used to manufacture thousands of face shields for healthcare workers, who are struggling to access personal protective equipment amid widespread shortages.\n\n\u201cWith 3D printing, we\u2019ve been able to go from making hands to making face shields in a matter of, well, days,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cTo completely revamp our line, that\u2019s how agile this technology is and how flexible it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mat Bowtell\u2019s 3D printing factory that has rapidly shifted into production of face protectors to help frontline medical workers deal with Covid-19. Photograph: Free 3D Hands\n\nBowtell\u2019s story is not unique. All across the country, catastrophe has caused remarkable transformations. Industry in the pandemic age is finding strange ways to meet the strangest of demands. Local gin distilleries are making hand sanitiser. Carmakers are offering design expertise for hospital ventilators.\n\nDetmold, a food packaging company, is now producing surgical masks. Textor, a company that previously created materials for nappies, sanitary pads and baby wipes, has repurposed its business toward personal protective equipment (PPE) with the help of the CSIRO.\n\nThe manufacturing industry\u2019s guide during this pandemic-induced transformation is the Advanced Manufacturing Growth Centre, a not-for-profit working with the federal government.\n\nIt is trying to help the sector pivot into Covid-19-related work, setting up a central portal where businesses can register their skills, supplies, and capabilities.\n\n\u201cOnce we set up the portal, heaven broke loose,\u201d the AMGC managing director, Dr Jens Goennemann, told the Guardian.\n\n\u201cUp to today, we had 1,000 registrations from companies who not only said \u2018I want to help\u2019, but they said how they could do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that means we can make a heat map of different skills and capabilities, which we can then throw at the most targeted need.\u201d\n\nThe speed of the pivot has been remarkable. But it has also raised a broader question.\n\nBefore the crisis, only a single Australian factory, Med-Con\u2019s Shepparton plant, was producing surgical masks. Similarly, there was only one significant onshore producer of ventilators, a company named Resmed.\n\nLabor senator Kim Carr, a former industry minister, says this highlights a failing that extends well beyond just PPE and ventilators.\n\nHow, he asks, has Australia allowed key strategic industries to disappear? And why has it taken a crisis for Australia\u2019s shortcomings to be so greatly exposed?\n\n\u201cThis is a profound problem now,\u201d Carr says. \u201cFor even the most simple-minded of our rightwing economists, understanding the implications of these matters surely now demonstrates the importance of us developing a more economically complex society and a more sovereign nation.\u201d\n\nThe consequences of shortages in PPE, as one example, have been thrown into sharp relief in recent weeks.\n\nThe paucity of supplies forced hospitals to stop elective surgeries and left aged care providers with serious threats to their ability to deliver services.\n\nWorkers at dialysis units have been left to scrounge for their own masks, despite their patients being one of the most at-risk groups from Covid-19. A cancer treatment centre had to begin producing its own sanitiser using donated chemicals after vast quantities mysteriously went missing from its stores.\n\nCatholic Healthcare Australia, which represents members with 80 hospitals, warned the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, the situation was dire and that it held \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about PPE access.\n\nLocal manufacturing has now become a critical part of the pandemic response, both in Australia and across the world.\n\nThe World Health Organization has urged every country to boost its domestic PPE production by 40%.\n\n\u201cWithout secure supply chains, the risk to healthcare workers around the world is real,\u201d WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. \u201cIndustry and governments must act quickly to boost supply, ease export restrictions and put measures in place to stop speculation and hoarding. We can\u2019t stop Covid-19 without protecting health workers first.\u201d\n\nThe Australian government has responded with a multifaceted strategy. It issued a callout to domestic industry to understand who may be able to pivot into PPE manufacturing, while releasing stocks from the reserves in the national medical stockpile. It has also sent the army in to help Med-Con, which is aiming to double or triple its production.\n\nExports of PPE have also been banned.\n\nSome say Australia\u2019s current situation exposes a failing of crisis planning.\n\nThe chair of the Australian Healthcare Reform Alliance, Jennifer Doggett, said the gradual offshoring of PPE production was \u201cclearly extremely risky\u201d in the event of a pandemic.\n\n\u201cThis situation should prompt a rethink of our approach over the past several decades to move away from domestic manufacturing towards a reliance on imports,\u201d she said. \u201cThis may save money in the short term but it is costing us now. In a wealthy country like Australia, it is unacceptable to risk the lives of health professionals because we do not have the facilities to manufacture simple materials such as masks and swabs.\u201d\n\nI am a frontline doctor: here\u2019s how you can help me | Ranjana Srivastava Read more\n\nUnions take a similar view. The national secretary of the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union, Paul Bastian, told the Guardian: \u201cI think this crisis has certainly exposed the dangers of destroying Australian manufacturing and relying entirely on an import-based model.\n\n\u201cOf course, as we move forward out of this crisis sometime in the future, we hope that government continues to invest in Australian manufacturing, as they have to do right now when they don\u2019t have an alternative.\u201d\n\nAdamm Ferrier, a lecturer in public health at La Trobe University who helped set up Health Purchasing Victoria, agrees that there has been a \u201cmovement offshore of many manufacturing processes to countries where labour costs are more competitive\u201d.\n\nBut Ferrier also says the problem is partly explained by the way hospitals had changed their stocking of PPE in recent years.\n\n\u201cSince the 1990s there has been a movement towards a \u2018just in time\u2019 supply practice that replaced a \u2018just in case\u2019 practice, where hospitals held vast quantities of supplies that often went out of date,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018just in time\u2019 practice has served the system well, but was always predicated on the ability for the manufacture and medical supply chain to respond nimbly to changes in demand.\u201d\n\nGoennemann, a leader in the industry, disputes suggestions that manufacturing is in decline in Australia.\n\nHe is careful to distinguish Australia\u2019s manufacturing sector from what people generally associate it with \u2013 producing things in factories. Production, he says, is just one part of the manufacturing process, along with research, development, design, logistics, distribution, sales and services.\n\nIn fact, Goennemann said Australia may be uniquely placed to respond. He points to 3D printing, of which Australia has an \u201cincredible onshore capability\u201d, as an example.\n\n\u201cThe 3D printing capability onshore is a massive distinguisher for Australia to step up to the crisis,\u201d he said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mat Bowtell (right) in one of the face shields printed on 3D printers in his Cowes factory. Photograph: Free 3D Hands\n\nWhen asked how else 3D printing might be deployed in practice, Goennemann points to the supply of ventilators, which are needed to assist breathing in the most seriously ill Covid-19 patients.\n\nA lack of ventilators has been a critical issue in countries like Italy, where doctors in swamped intensive care units have been forced to make heart-wrenching decisions about who gets access to the life-saving machines.\n\nAustralia has about 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the country. The government wants to increase the number of ICU beds dramatically to prepare for the peak of the pandemic, and is attempting to source more ventilators through a combination of domestic production, procurement from abroad, and the conversion of existing equipment, including from veterinarians.\n\nGoennemann says Resmed, the main ventilator manufacturer, could struggle to get parts due to the disruption of global supply chains.\n\nThat\u2019s where 3D printing can help.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to speak on behalf of Resmed, but that\u2019s an area where we have critical supply, and parts can be 3D printed onshore rather than being procured offshore,\u201d he said.\n\nThe industry minister, Karen Andrews, is heading up the government\u2019s efforts to ramp up domestic production of PPE and ventilators. A special unit has been convened within her department to specifically look at PPE supply.\n\nAboriginal health services warn of 'catastrophic' shortage of coronavirus protective equipment Read more\n\nAndrews says the response of industry is a testament to the ingenuity that exists in Australia.\n\n\u201cSo many companies are putting up their hands to help \u2013 whether it\u2019s ramping up manufacturing, looking to switch up what they produce, or even just connecting with each other to make sure they have what they need,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Bowtell, the decision to shift his production to face shields had nothing to do with profit. It was about doing what he could in the most extraordinary of times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about survival at the moment,\u201d Bowtell said. \u201cJust helping people to get through this together.\u201d","tests":null,"ventilators":"['2,300 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Look to Taiwan, says Dr. C. Jason Wang, director of Stanford University's Center for Policy, Outcomes and Prevention.\n\nFollowing the 2003 SARS epidemic, Taiwan dramatically built up its public health infrastructure to launch an immediate response to the next crisis.\n\nWell-trained and experienced public health officials were quick to recognize the crisis and launched an emergency public health response to contain the emerging outbreak, Wang and colleagues from the United States and Taiwan reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"If you let the fire burn, you could lose control of the critical moment when we could deal with it and put it out faster,\" Wang says. \"The impact is much greater.\"\n\nAn island just 81 miles off the coast of mainland China, Taiwan was a COVID-19 catastrophe waiting to happen. More than 850,000 of the island's 23 million citizens actually live in mainland China. Another 400,000 work there. Last year, nearly 3 million people from mainland China touched down in Taiwan, bringing billions of microbial hitchhikers with them, as travelers always do.\n\nThe virus picked the worst possible moment, just days before the Lunar New Year, to shift its base of operations from the animal kingdom into humans. It is a time when millions of Chinese and Taiwanese travel for the holidays. Many stream through Wuhan, the outbreak's apparent point of origin and one of just four major Chinese railway hubs.\n\nYet, against all odds, Taiwan has remained relatively coronavirus free. As of March 8, the World Health Organization had logged just 45 COVID-19 cases and one death since China notified WHO of the outbreak in late December. Not a single case has been reported in the last 24 hours. China's caseload now stands at about 81,000 with 3,100 deaths.\n\n\"It really does speak to the importance of planning,\" says Jeremy Youde, dean of liberal arts at the University of Minnesota Duluth and an internationally recognized expert on global health politics. \"Not just the policy responses, but knowing what kinds of assets we have on the ground.\"\n\n\"We don't suddenly have 100,000 hospital beds lying around that could be used in the event of an outbreak.\"\n\nHow has Taiwan, a country on China's doorstep, managed to contain COVID-19 when so many countries have failed? One answer is leadership, and at the very top. Taiwan's vice president, Chen Chien-jen, is an epidemiologist who received his doctorate at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. He was formerly vice president of Taiwan's premier research institution.\n\nTaiwan learned the hard way \u2013 in the SARS coronavirus epidemic in 2003 \u2013 what can happen when something goes wrong. For the first couple of months after the World Health Organization posted its first global SARS alert, Taiwan was spared the brunt of the epidemic. The island tallied just 29 probable cases and no deaths and the growth rate was relatively slow, typical of a minor outbreak.\n\nThat changed on April 22, 2003, when a cluster of seven infections were reported in Hoping Hospital in Taipei. Desperate to limit the spread of the infection within the hospital, administrators dispersed SARS patients to other hospitals.\n\nThose infections sparked a cascade of local transmissions that culminated in 116 probable cases and 10 deaths in just two weeks, according to a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\nBy mid-May, Taiwan's caseload soared to 264 cases and 34 deaths. By June 1, the outbreak had roughly tripled, reaching 680 cases and 81 deaths, a six-fold increase in less than a month. Ten of the dead were Taiwanese health workers; seven worked at Hoping Hospital.\n\nSubsequent after-action reports laid blame for the massive flare-up on a lack of preparation, mismanagement and carelessness. Taiwanese health officials vowed not to get caught unprepared again. They established a National Health Command Center as the hub of a number of smaller centers charged with responding to epidemics, biological pathogens, bioterrorism and medical emergencies.\n\nThe instant Taiwanese officials learned that China notified the World Health Organization of a pneumonia of unknown origin, on Dec. 31, 2019, they sent health workers to board planes from Wuhan and assess passengers for fever or pneumonia before they were allowed to disembark on the island.\n\nWithin a week, they expanded their surveillance net to include anyone who had traveled to Wuhan in the previous two weeks. And by Jan. 20, the government activated the Central Epidemic Command Center and charged it with coordinating all government efforts to combat the growing health crisis. In an effort to contain the epidemic, Taiwan employed the most powerful tools at its disposal \u2013 big data and analytics.\n\nThe country, which has a national health insurance program, was able to link its national health insurance database with its customs and immigration records and quickly identify anyone who entered the country from China and sought medical care. Health officials began testing patients for coronavirus if they had severe respiratory illness and a negative influenza test so they could identify unsuspected cases and anyone with whom the patients might have had contact.\n\nA toll-free number was established so that citizens could report suspicious symptoms or cases. As the outbreak grew, the hotline was overwhelmed and cities were asked to establish their own toll-free numbers.\n\nIn a matter of days, the government created a list of 124 \"action items,\" including land and sea border controls, active case finding and quarantine of people with suspected infection and making sure the health system has the resources needed to manage disease.\n\nThe government also launched an educational campaign to inform and calm a frightened public and combat misinformation. On the policy front, plans were drawn up for dealing with infections in child care settings, schools and businesses. Taiwanese schools are easier to manage than U.S. schools, because the students do not disperse and rotate from class to class. Instead the teachers rotate.\n\nWhen a Taiwanese student gets sick, school administrators can cancel the class. If two students in a school get sick, the school closes down. If a third of the schools in the community are closed, all the schools shut down, according to the action plan.\n\nIn the U.S., where students travel from class to class, Wang says, \"If one student gets sick, the virus has rotated everywhere.\"\n\nImposing such stringent measures in the U.S. would be almost impossible, Wang says. The U.S. is vast, geographically, and places public health authority at the state and local level. The federal government must wait for an invitation to launch public health activities at the state level, such as the U.S. Public Health Service \"strike team\" that was dispatched to Seattle last week.\n\nMaking matters worse, the U.S. doesn't have a national health insurance plan \u2013 and medical insurance plans don't share their records. It would be next to impossible to do the kind of proactive case finding, contact tracing and surveillance in the U.S. that is central to Taiwan's pandemic response.\n\nThe U.S. could, however, mount a far more effective response than it has so far. Wang says.\n\n\"The United States has enormous capacity. We have more capacity, more talent, and more money than any place in the world,\" he says. \"It's a matter of recognizing that this is a crisis that needs to be dealt with in a speedy, coordinated fashion.\"\n\n","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['100,000 hospital beds']","ppe":null}
{"country":"Sri Lanka","publish_date":"04-02-2020 00:00","url":"https:\/\/www.wsws.org\/en\/articles\/2020\/04\/02\/slco-a02.html","title":"Sri Lankan medical experts demand mass coronavirus testing","text":"Sri Lankan medical experts demand mass coronavirus testing\n\nBy Naveen Dewage\n\n2 April 2020\n\nSri Lankan medical experts have called on government authorities to immediately introduce mass testing for COVID-19 in order to stop community transmissions spreading the virus throughout the country.\n\nTheir appeals, which were published in several newspapers this week, came as confirmed COVID-19 cases rose to 146 and fatalities climbed to a total of three. The number of people officially held in quarantine centres is currently about 1,700. Health authorities have placed many villages under isolation and hundreds of people have been asked to home quarantine.\n\nThe call for mass testing was issued by University of Colombo Family Medicine faculty chief Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa and publicly endorsed by professors Vajira H.W. Dissanayake, Harendra De Silva and Dr. Ravi P. Rannan-Eliya.\n\nDr Ruvaiz\n\n\u201cThere is a dire need to rapidly increase and expand testing if we want to have a positive impact. The strongest point of our response to the pandemic from a healthcare perspective should be how we can improve our weakest point, which at the moment is testing for COVID-19,\u201d Haniffa said.\n\nSome of those infected may not show symptoms and, because of Sri Lanka\u2019s scandalously low and dangerous testing policies, can go undetected and spread the virus. As of March 29, Sri Lanka had only conducted 2,082 tests. These have revealed 115 infections, an alarming 5.5 percent positive rate.\n\n\u201cIf we do not expand testing and identify those with the virus,\u201d Professor Dissanayake observed, \u201cthe curfews would be useless.\u201d He also stressed the urgent necessity to protect health workers. When health workers, without prior knowledge and experience and no protective equipment, are exposed to infected patients then they have to be quarantined and cannot work, he warned.\n\nDissanayake pointed out that longer quarantine periods could be avoided if mass testing was introduced immediately. Several health workers\u2014from the state and private sectors\u2014are currently in quarantine.\n\nProfessor De Silva bluntly declared: \u201cWe cannot be complacent. We are sitting on the tip of the iceberg\u2026 We are not looking out to detect and track cases actively. We are passive: only a selected lot of those seeking treatment are tested. If we do not actively detect the iceberg, it will become a volcano.\u201d\n\nDr. Rannan-Eliya commented: \u201cMore extensive testing means increasing our testing capacity by at least ten-fold so we can test up to 10,000 people a day in an emergency.\u201d Infected people would keep entering Sri Lanka, he said, until \u201ca global solution\u201d was found. \u201cWe need to provide ample facilities for people to test and re-test and diagnose COVID-19 cases,\u201d he stated.\n\nSeveral doctors spoke to the WSWS yesterday, confirming the medical experts\u2019 warnings. They complained about a lack of sufficient ventilators and test kits and pointed to the serious dangers facing medical workers.\n\nMany health workers, the doctors explained, were using hurriedly made and substandard personal protective equipment (PPE), endangering their own lives and those of their patients. These conditions are the result of decades of cuts to health services by consecutive Sri Lankan governments.\n\nWhile medical experts are calling for mass testing, the Rajapakse administration is mainly concentrating on \u201csocial distancing,\u201d \u201ctracing\u201d and its lockdown and curfews. These measures are being enforced by the police and the military.\n\nColombo, Gampaha, and Kaluthara districts in the Western Province, the Northern Jaffna district, Puttalam in the Northeast and the central Kandy district have all been named as \u201cvulnerable zones\u201d and are under total lockdown. Special Task Force police commandoes are being used for \u201csecurity\u201d in Colombo where barricades and patrols have been instituted.\n\nThe curfew was lifted in several districts for a few hours on Tuesday to allow people to buy essentials, which are, however, becoming scarce. Some of the communities that have been completely isolated include Atalugama village and five villages in Beruwela, in Kalutara district, Akurana in Kandy and the Darawela Tea Estate near Hatton.\n\nThe lockdown and curfews are creating enormous hardships for workers, the poor, the self-employed and other sections of society. There are no proper mechanisms for people to buy essentials. The mass of the population is simply ordered to obey government dictates, which are then enforced by the police and the military.\n\nPresident Gotabhaya Rajapakse has appointed a Special Presidential Task Force, headed by his younger brother Basil Rajapakse. The task force has issued numerous statements about special \u201crelief packages\u201d for the needy. The packages contain a small quantity of dry rations, which are sold to raise money for the poor.\n\nSamurdhi welfare program beneficiaries, who are paid a pittance by the government, have been promised a 10,000 rupee ($US52) payment in April and May. The \u201cpayment\u201d is an interest free loan that must be repaid in 18 months.\n\nWorkers and elderly people from the Theresa Estate in Bogawanthalawa in the Central Hills waited in line for about eight hours when the curfew was lifted yesterday. They were led to believe that they would be given a charity payment for the elderly and a relief package from the Samurdhi Department. No official turned up and they returned to their estate line room accommodation empty handed.\n\nOn Monday it was revealed during a discussion at the Badulla district government administrative office that the distribution of \u201crelief packages\u201d to villages and low-income groups in the municipal area had failed because no essential food items could be obtained.\n\nRemote farmers from Girandurukotte village in Badulla told the WSWS that they have not received any relief. The farmers said that the village officer and local policemen had collected food items from the farmers themselves and distributed them among several families.\n\nAbout 800 farming families live in Girandurukotte. Many of the village youth have migrated to get work in Sri Lanka\u2019s free trade zones or other jobs in the cities. Following the imposition of the lockdown and the closure of factories they have been forced to return home, but without any way of earning an income.\n\nLast week the curfew required tens of thousands of free trade zone workers to stay inside their boarding houses. As workers\u2019 anger began to mount, the government intervened and sent them back to their villages. The government, however, failed to ensure that the workers were paid last month\u2019s wages and that they continue to receive their pay until the factories reopen.\n\nPresident Rajapakse is using the coronavirus pandemic to step up the militarisation of his administration. At the same time, in the face of rising discontent, his government is bringing the \u201copposition\u201d parties on board to assist in the suppression of the inevitable mass resistance to the lack of food and other essentials, including proper healthcare.\n\nOn March 24, the United National Party and its splinter group, the Jathika Samagi Balavegaya, along with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the Tamil National Alliance and several Muslim parties, participated in an all-party meeting called by Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse. All those in attendance pledged their support. The Sri Lankan prime minister has invited these organisations to attend another all-party conference today.\n\nThe author also recommends:\n\nSri Lankan SEP to hold online event: \u201cCOVID-19 pandemic and capitalist barbarism\u201d\n\n[1 April 2020]\n\nCoronavirus crisis in Sri Lanka: A program for the working class\n\n[28 March 2020]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.","tests":"['2,082 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

We have adequate stock of medicine, food, drinks and fuel for months,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, his brother and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa ordered a reduction in the prices of certain essential commodities in order to aid the public during the crisis.\n\nExpanding facilities\n\nDoctors fear they do not have enough resources to deal with a large-scale outbreak. So far, all patients who test positive for COVID-19 are being treated at the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) in Colombo.\n\n\"We are expanding the ICU by converting a section of the hospital into it,\" said Wijewickrama. \"The air force is building a small building within the hospital premises. They will complete the work within three [or] four days.\"\n\nTo check the spread of COVID-19, the Sri Lankan government has closed all international commercial flights into the country until at least March 25. A mandatory 14-day quarantine process is in place for those who have returned from countries where large-scale COVID-19 outbreak has been detected.\n\nThe imposition of a curfew was aimed at promoting social distancing, which the World Health Organization has recommended to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nAuthorities are strictly enforcing the curfew, with at least 2,000 people arrested for violating it over the weekend, according to the Sri Lankan police.\n\nCompared with its densely populated South Asian neighbours, Sri Lanka has a better health infrastructure, with 2.38 ICU beds per 100,000 people, according to Dr Naveen De Soysa, assistant secretary of the Government Medical Officers' Association.\n\n\"When we compare COVID-19 situation in Sri Lanka with Italy, we can say that Sri Lanka is capable of stopping the spread,\" he said, as he lauded the government's decision to impose curfew early in the outbreak to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nChina is supporting the Sri Lankan government's efforts, with a $500m loan extended last week to help fight the virus, according to a statement issued by the Chinese foreign ministry.\n\nSri Lankan soldiers in protective gear spray disinfectants at a railway station in Colombo [Eranga Jayawardena\/The Associated Press]\n\nImpact on tourism\n\nSri Lanka significantly depends on tourism, which makes up nearly 5 percent of its $87bn GDP. Those in the tourism industry fear the global downturn in travel could affect the island nation disproportionately.\n\nThe tourism sector in Sri Lanka provides direct or indirect employment to at least 500,000 people, according to a hotel owners' group.\n\n\"The tourism sector provides a significant amount of jobs to Sri Lankans ... More than two million people depend on income from tourism,\" said Sanath Ukwatte, president of the Hotel Association of Sri Lanka.\n\nTourism has been down since the 2019 Easter Sunday attacks, which targeted luxury hotels and Christian churches, killing more than 250 people.\n\nIn January this year, Ukwatte had said Sri Lanka's tourism industry was recovering.

Here, a Malian researcher holds a sample to be tested at a research center in Bamako (AFP Photo\/MICHELE CATTANI)\n\nBamako (AFP) - At a seven-bed isolation centre in Mali's capital Bamako, medical staff are scrambling to prepare for an outbreak of the new coronavirus.\n\nAlthough no cases have yet been declared in the war-torn country, health authorities are bracing for an onslaught of patients with few resources to accommodate them.\n\nAccording to an official document consulted by AFP in mid-March, the impoverished Sahel country has just a single ventilator -- the crucial equipment for dealing with respiratory failure -- although the health ministry later said the figure is 56 machines.\n\n\"We are preparing for the worst,\" conceded Prime Minister Boubou Cisse on Thursday. \"The means we have do not allow us to be behind every Malian.\"\n\nJust 20 or so isolation beds are available across the country, according to Cisse, a figure that the ministry later said was 37.\n\nThe World Health Organization has called on the African continent to \"wake up\", after the first death in sub-Saharan Africa from the pandemic was announced on Wednesday in Burkina Faso, which borders Mali.\n\nMillions of people could die from the new coronavirus, particularly in poor countries, if it is allowed to spread unchecked, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday, appealing for a coordinated global response.\n\n\"Global solidarity is not only a moral imperative, it is in everyone's interests,\" he said.\n\nIn Bamako, Dr Ilo Bella Diall said he did what he could to prepare as soon as the epidemic began to spread outside China. The director of Point G University Hospital had unused hospital buildings converted for isolating COVID-19 patients.\n\n\"We are preparing for all possible scenarios,\" he said.\n\nBut according to the Ministry of Health, Mali has only 600 litres of hydro-alcoholic gel despite a need for 500,000 litres, and 59 medical infrared thermometers, well short of the 20,000 needed. The country has only 2,000 test kits and no suitable thermal cameras to detect fevers.\n\n- War on two fronts -\n\nThis vast country in the Sahel has already been grappling with a war for eight years: first against independence movements in 2012, then against a jihadist insurgency that has spread from northern Mali to its centre, as well as to Niger and Burkina Faso on its southern border.\n\nThe fighting has caused thousands of civilian and military deaths. On Thursday, the army said around 30 Malian soldiers were killed and five more injured in a suspected jihadist attack.\n\n\"Today, added to our classic challenges is that of succeeding in the war against the coronavirus,\" President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said on Tuesday at a Defence Council meeting.\n\nThe war is mostly one of awareness. Fear of the coronavirus has not yet taken hold in Bamako: tea glasses are still being shared and hands are still being shaken.\n\nIn buses and taxis, customers still huddle together. It is only in the upper echelons of power that people greet each other with an elbow.\n\n\"We have to communicate so that Malians become aware of the magnitude of the pandemic,\" said Seydou Doumbia, dean of the medical school in Bamako where 143 tests of the virus -- all negative -- had been carried out as of last Thursday.\n\nThe option of confinement has so far been ruled out in a country whose economy is heavily dependent on the informal sector, with the majority of the population earning a meagre day-to-day living.\n\nThe government has, however, suspended flights from affected countries and closed schools in a bid to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\n- Health systems not ready -\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the University of Sciences, Techniques and Technologies of Bamako, Doumbia runs Mali's only laboratory meeting the required biosafety standards to study the new disease.\n\nIn the confined enclaves of the laboratory, built and maintained with American funding, 13 researchers tirelessly analyse samples.\n\n\"Yesterday, we finished at midnight.

However, their delivery depends on finding the providers, the restrictions imposed by the governments of the exporting countries, and the existing manufacturing capacity.\n\nAt a potential epidemic peak of 10,000 Covid-19 patients, critical cases account for 10% of the total. If the peak does not come suddenly, the support capacity offered by the existing ventilators will not be exceeded, T\u0103taru said.\n\nThe health minister explained that, in addition to mechanical ventilators, doctors can use the existing anesthesia machines and monitored beds.\n\nAccording to data from the National Public Health Institute quoted by G4media.ro, hospitals reported having 2,816 mechanical ventilators, 1,987 anesthesia machines, and 7,670 monitors. However, not all of the equipment is in use, medical sources explained.\n\nWith a population of in between 19 and 19.5 people at the beginning of 2019, according to data from the National Statics Institute, Romania has around 7 (7.7 \u2013 7.8) ventilators per 100,000 people.\n\nIf all the reported 2,816 ventilators were in use, then around 14 (14.3 \u2013 14.7) devices would be available per 100,000 people.\n\nOn Friday, March 27, Alexandru Rafila, the president of the Romanian Microbiology Society, said that he was most worried about the capacity of the intensive care units because a mechanical ventilator is used for three weeks, on average, on a patient, while Romania has 1,300 such devices.\n\nCountries everywhere are looking to buy more ventilators as hospitals face shortages of equipment because of the large number of Covid-19 patients needing treatment. In mid-March, Germany was looking to buy 10,000 such devices, while Italy 5,000, Reuters reported.\n\nIn Romania, the project of a locally-designed ventilator, developed in Timi\u015foara, is going into testing phase this week. Meanwhile, the Romanian companies in the automotive industry have formed a group with the aim of starting production of medical mechanical ventilators, economy minister Virgil Popescu announced.\n\n(Photo: Lorenzo Capunata\/ Dreamstime.com)","tests":null,"ventilators":"['2,000 ventilators', '2,816 ventilators', '1,500 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

We have started this war with the virus empty-handed, with no stocks of medical supplies for the risks of an epidemic and, within just a few weeks, we have done everything humanly possible to get the healthcare system ready for this fight,\u201d he wrote.\n\nDanc\u0103 spoke of international acquisition contracts canceled without hesitation at the first higher counter-offer.\n\n\u201cThe entire process of acquiring, contracting, transporting, delivering, and distributing the sanitary and medical supplies needed at this time has received the connotations of an international war for limited resources. There have been unprecedented situations, when firm international acquisitions contracts were canceled without hesitation, with the return of the down payments, at the first higher counter-offer. Other contracts, in the process of being delivered, got stuck after national decisions to ban exports,\u201d he explained.\n\nHe also said that ensuring transport and flight corridors has become more difficult at this time than ensuring humanitarian aid convoys pass through armed conflict zones.\n\nDanc\u0103 said that every county in Romania will have real-time PCR machines soon.\n\n\u201cThere are 1,600 mechanical ventilators available for critical patients, and we are making efforts to bring another 200 to Romania in the coming days. At the same time, we are preparing the local production as well. Moreover, through Unifarm, the National Office for Centralized Acquisitions (ONAC) or the Red Cross, over 2 million masks and almost 800,000 protective suits have arrived in the country and another 14 million FFP2\/3 masks will be delivered in April. We have prepared the local production for 15 million masks per month. Even so, with all these efforts, the threat from the virus continues to be high and we can never say that we have everything we need to cope with the worst,\u201d Danc\u0103 also wrote.\n\nOn Saturday, April 4, PM Ludovic Orban said there are contracts with various suppliers for the delivery of 400 ventilators to Romania but the delivery schedule was not being followed. Solutions were being identified for the start of the local production, Agerpres reported.\n\n\u201cWe have contracts for 400 ventilators. Unfortunately, the delivery schedule that we established is not followed because of decisions by governments or presidents of various exporting countries that blocked the exit of the equipment from the country,\u201d Orban said.\n\nThe PM said the authorities were also looking at repairing the existing, broken ventilators and thus make available another 80-100 such devices.\n\nOrban explained that the Defense Ministry was also working on the project of a ventilator.\n\n\u201cThe Defense Ministry is working on the project of a ventilator. [\u2026] I hope we are able to test it as soon as possible. We need to identify production capacities for the components: the ventilation equipment, the monitor and all the other devices used are very sensitive; the patients\u2019 lives depend on them and they include very many parts that need to be manufactured in the best conditions,\u201d Orban said.\n\n(Photo: Lorenzo Capunata\/ Dreamstime)\n\n[email protected]","tests":null,"ventilators":"['400 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Most are raising money for protective equipment or other materials the healthcare workers need to fight the pandemic, but some have even bigger plans, such as building a modular hospital for coronavirus patients. Below is a list of such campaigns and initiatives (and everyone is welcome to join their efforts).\n\nThe Romanian Red Cross has launched the national fundraising campaign \u201cRomania saves Romania\u201d aimed at raising donations to help local hospitals and the medical staff fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The NGO will use the collected funds to provide medical equipment and materials to hospitals, but also for assistance with food and hygiene packages for vulnerable persons in isolation at home, as well to provide assistance to quarantine centers in the country. Everyone can donate EUR 2 for this campaign via text message at 8827, or online here.\n\nDaruieste Viata, which is currently building a hospital in Bucharest through private donations, also announced that all the donations collected starting March 11 would be directed to the fight against coronavirus and to supporting the healthcare system. Thus, the NGO has been raising money for protective and medical equipment that are then donated to hospitals and health workers, but also for a much ambitious project \u2013 a modular hospital for COVID-19 patients, which is currently being built next to the Elias Hospital in Bucharest. Donations can be made online here.\n\nZi de Bine Association also decided to change its original concept of supporting one cause per month for 12 months and join the fight against coronavirus instead. Thus, the association has been collecting money for tests, disinfectants, protective equipment for doctors, medical beds, intubation kits, mechanical ventilation equipment, and other much-needed equipment. Those who want to help can send an SMS at 8862 with the message \u2018SUS\u2019 (one text message equals a donation of EUR 4). Donations can also be made by bank transfer or PayPal. Further details are available here. The NGO also announced that is has joined the initiative of French retailers Auchan and Leroy Merlin, which have started setting up a hospitalization center for non-critical COVID-19 patients, in the Bucharest-Ilfov area.\n\nUNICEF Romania also started a fundraising campaign aimed at raising donations that would be used to buy protective equipment for professionals in the field of social and healthcare services, which are essential for vulnerable children in Romania and their families. Donations can be made by SMS at 8844 with the text message \u201cCOPIL\u201d or online here.\n\nSave the Children Romania opened an emergency fund for the immediate support of the local healthcare system. The donations collected so far have been used to buy medical equipment and materials hospitals and healthcare workers need to treat COVID-19 patients. But medical facilities across the country still need help. Donations can be made online here (where those interested can also find more information).\n\nThe Magic Association also opened an emergency fund for hospitals, with the same aim: to help medical facilities and doctors fight the novel coronavirus pandemic in Romania by providing them with protective materials, supplies, hospital equipment and whatever else is needed to cross this critical period. Donations can be made online here and here.\n\nBanca Transilvania, Mobexpert, Bitdefender and eMAG have launched the platform \u201eDoneaz\u0103 pentru linia \u00eent\u00e2i\u201d (Donate for the front line) to help doctors and healthcare staff treating COVID-19 patients, but also the Police, Army or Gendarmerie, which are present on the streets every day. Together, the four companies have donated RON 4 million so far and have been involved in the procurement and distribution process, and in the organization of the donation platform. Those interested can make donations online or by bank transfers, all details are available here.\n\nAjutati Salvarea (Help the Ambulance), a project launched at the end of March by two Bucharesters, both workers at the Bucharest-Ilfov Ambulance Service, has been raising donations for the purchase of protective equipment and biocides for ambulance workers. Further details are available here.\n\nThe Margareta of Romania Royal Foundation has initiated a special fund aimed at helping the elderly affected by the coronavirus crisis and the isolation caused by this pandemic. Those who want to donate can do it online here, or they can send an SMS with the text \u201cSINGUR\u201d at 8844. Further details about this initiative are available here.\n\nThe organizers of major festivals and events in Cluj-Napoca have put up for sale \u201csolidarity tickets,\u201d in an attempt to help the local authorities equip hospitals with all the materials they need to fight COVID-19. About 60 events, civic organizations, companies, universities and public administration institutions from Cluj county have joined the project. Further details are available here, and donations can be made here.\n\nInima Copiilor is trying to raise EUR 40,000 to buy an advanced neonatal ventilator for the Municipal Hospital in Oradea. Those who want to help can find more information here.\n\nLocal NGO Uniti pentru Viata (United for Life) is also collecting donations for the hospital in Targu Neamt. The funds will be used for medical and protective equipment. Further details here.\n\nAt the same time, Maria Holtzhauser Association is raising funds to equip the hospital in Falticeni. Those who want to help can send a SMS at 8837 with the message \u201cFalticeni.\u201d More details are available here.\n\nBogdan Tanasa, a local entrepreneur and fundraiser, whose association Casa Share has been building houses for poor families for several years, has also been raising funds to buy medical and protective equipment and supplies for the hospitals in the Moldova region. For example, in late-March, he has delivered an automated machine that processes Covid-19 tests to the Saint Parascheva Infectious Diseases Hospital in Iasi. At the same time, Bogdan continued to help the needy with food and personal hygiene products, while also working on a new house for a poor family. Further details on how to help Bogdan Tanasa with his social projects are available here.\n\nAlso in Moldova, local entrepreneur Stefan Mandachi, who became famous after building the first meter of highway in Moldova region to protest the poor infrastructure in this part of the country, has started raising funds for Red Cross Suceava. In this sense, he is now selling his \u201cone-meter highway\u201d, asking EUR 10 for every cm of road. Thus, everyone who donates EUR 10 will become the owner of 1 cm of the highway. Donations and further information are available at 1cm.ro.\n\nMarius Simionica, founder of the \u201cMarius si Prietenii\u201d Charity Foundation, also joined the fight against the new coronavirus and has been raising funds to buy medical supplies and equipment for hospitals.

The state of emergency announced by presidential decree imposes a nationwide quarantine and will restrict both entry to and departure from the country to all except diplomats and individuals invited by the government.\n\nKazakhstan had already announced the cancelation of Norouz holiday celebrations and a military parade devoted to the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany.\n\nOfficials there previously said more than 1,000 people were in quarantine and nearly 500 others in self-quarantine at home.\n\nUzbekistan announced similar sweeping measures on March 15, barring entry for all foreigners and departures by locals.\n\nThe Uzbek government also closed schools and universities for three weeks, canceled all public events, and suspended international air and highway connections beginning March 16.\n\nKazakhstan and Uzbekistan are the only Central Asian republics to have officially registered any cases of the new coronavirus at the center of a global pandemic.\n\nIranian Deaths Top 700\n\nMeanwhile, in Iran, as the number of fatalities attributed to COVID-19 topped 700, the official handling the response to the pandemic warned that the country's health facilities could soon be overwhelmed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf the trend continues, there will not be enough capacity,\u201d the state-run IRNA news agency quoted Ali Reza Zali as saying on March 15.\n\nThe country has reported that nearly 14,000 people are infected, behind only China and Italy.\n\nIran reportedly has around 110,000 hospital beds, including 30,000 in Tehran, and has said it will set up mobile clinics.

Then a new nightmare began for his family. No one in their city on Ecuador\u2019s Pacific coast would pick up his body.\n\n\u201cWe wrapped him up in black plastic,\u201d Larrea\u2019s wife, Karina, said Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019s here in the living room.\u201d\n\nHospitals are turning away patients and bodies are being left on streets and in homes for days in Guayaquil, a normally bustling city of 2.6 million that has become a hot spot in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic spreads.\n\nThe small South American nation has recorded 120 coronavirus deaths, but officials say there could be dozens more who died without ever being officially diagnosed \u2014 people like Larrea, who had all the symptoms, but never got tested. Nationwide, there were 3,160 cases confirmed on Thursday, likely a vast underestimate.\n\nMeanwhile, untold numbers of Ecuadorians are dying of unrelated diseases that can\u2019t be treated because hospitals are overwhelmed.\n\nIt\u2019s not just medical services at a breaking point. Morgues, funeral homes and all related services for the dead are over capacity.\n\nIn recent days, macabre images and pleas from families have appeared on social media showing dead loved ones wrapped in plastic or cloth, waiting for them to be taken away. Television crews have captured images of bodies and coffins left on sidewalks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a desperate smell,\u201d said Merwin Teran, 61, the owner of a Guayaquil funeral home, who said he saw 50 dead in one morgue alone.\n\nDoctors say there aren\u2019t enough tests in the country, making it harder to identify and isolate the sick to try to stop the spread of COVID-19, the disease the virus causes \u2014 as well as too few hospital beds and ventilators.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing a situation quite similar to that of Italy,\u201d said Dr. Mireya Rodas, a lung specialist at a Guayaquil hospital who has herself tested positive.\n\nEcuador identified its first case of COVID-19 on Feb. 29 \u2014 a 71-year-old woman who had traveled from Spain \u2014 making it one of the first Latin American countries to confirm the arrival of the disease.\n\nMedical experts fear the disaster brewing in Guayaquil may offer a frightening glimpse of what awaits the region in coming weeks and months.\n\n\u201cMore contagion, more mortality,\u201d said Enrique Acosta, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic research in Germany. \u201cThey are closely intertwined.\u201d\n\nAcosta is among a group of policy experts urging Latin American governments to quickly ramp up testing. They note that in countries like Singapore and South Korea, where the virus has been more quickly contained, testing was widespread. But that is not the case in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nMedical professionals believe the true number of coronavirus cases in Ecuador could be five times the official count or higher.\n\nTeran, the funeral home owner, said he went to a cemetery on Tuesday where workers usually inter about 30 people a day, but 149 bodies were awaiting burial or cremation.\n\nHe said many funeral homes are not operating, while those that are have to send workers to pick up bodies without adequate protection. By law, he said, funeral homes can\u2019t pick up bodies until a doctor has signed off on a cause of death, but because so many physicians are treating patients, bodies are accumulating in morgues, creating a backlog.\n\nNot all of the dead are dying from the coronavirus \u2014 which for most people, causes only mild to moderate symptoms, like a fever and cough. But for others, particularly older adults and those with other health problems, it can lead to pneumonia and death.\n\nCarmen Suarez, 71, died at her home over the weekend in Guayaquil from what the family believes was kidney failure. Relatives tried to find a hospital that would accept her as her legs grew increasingly swollen, but were told no beds were available and that taking her to a hospital would be risky anyway because of the coronavirus spread.\n\nBy Tuesday, the family had spent three days waiting for her body to be taken away. They eventually called a funeral home worker who brought a coffin and embalmed her body, which was still waiting on the family\u2019s patio.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s catastrophic what is happening in Guayaquil,\u201d said Byron Moreira, 36, her son-in-law. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t wish this on my worst enemy.\u201d\n\nEsteban Ortiz, a public health specialist, said that in the province of Guayas, which includes Guayaquil and where 70% of the country\u2019s virus cases are located, only around 175 ventilators are likely available. On Thursday, 225 people were hospitalized, including 122 in serious condition nationwide, indicating a likely critical shortage of the live-saving equipment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving them a chance to come and get medical attention,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ministry of Public Health did not respond to requests for comment. But at a news conference Wednesday, health authorities defended Ecuador\u2019s response, saying that new technology would soon allow testing to increase to 1,400 a day.\n\nJorge Wated, the official tasked by the government with handling the death toll crisis, said authorities were preparing for many more fatalities and working to ensure all are buried appropriately. He said authorities usually pick up about 30 people who have died in their homes each day, but have been picking up around 150, not all of whom died of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cWe ask for forgiveness for those who had to wait days for their loved ones to be picked up,\u201d he said.\n\nGina Watson, representative for the Pan American Health Organization in Ecuador, said experts expect to see a similar uptick in cases elsewhere in the region.\n\n\u201cGuayaquil is experiencing what we expect to see in all countries,\u201d she said. \u201cA rising curve of cases along with the associated mortality.\u201d\n\nUntil he came down with a 102-degree fever a week ago, Larrea had no known health problems other than being overweight, his family said.\n\nThe family called doctors, who advised him to stay home and take an over-the-counter fever reducer.\n\nAs he grew worse \u2014 struggling to breath and changing color \u2014 the family called for an ambulance, only to be told none were available to go to their poor neighborhood.\n\nThe family was dependent on the 42-year-old Uber driver and father of four for their economic livelihood and together with other relatives \u2014 eight people in total \u2014 live in a small home.\n\nRelated Articles Twitter founder Jack Dorsey pledges $1 billion in stock to COVID-19 relief\n\nSanta Clara County police, first responders get new COVID-19 decontamination station\n\nBay Area coronavirus transit cuts: Can\u2019t keep up?

He wants to ensure that all healthcare workers and the vulnerable people they work with can be tested and protected. The extra tests will initially go to healthcare workers and patients in nursing homes, disabled care, home care, and mental health care. After that, GPs can offer tests to people in risk groups.\n\nIn order to increase testing capacity, public health institute RIVM expanded the number of labs that can test for Covid-19 from 15 to 41, NU.nl reports. If necessary, these laboratories can be charged to run 24 hours a day, increasing the possible tests to 29 thousand per day.\n\nThe RIVM will keep using its current test kits, which take about 24 hours to confirm a coronavirus diagnosis. Biotech companies are increasingly making faster tests, that can diagnose a Covid-19 infection within a few hours.

The government also suspended military conscription, a cornerstone of its sustained military campaign.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOn March 20, the government banned entry for foreigners, after the first coronavirus victim reached Syria by road from Lebanon after returning from Europe. Health officials have limited testing capacity, but have deployed medical teams at the national level and to 1,864 health clinics across the country. The World Health Organization also supplied the government with testing kits, but only one Damascus-based lab is reportedly testing for the virus. Prices for masks, disinfectant and medicine have surged while the public health infrastructure remains fractured and under-resourced.\n\nChina already deployed several medical teams to assist with the outbreak in Iraq and Iran, and has provided testing kits to Syria. China\u2019s U.N. ambassador joined the U.N. call for the lifting of sanctions on Syria, suggesting it is only a matter of time before Beijing assists Damascus. The United States has committed an additional $16.8 million for humanitarian programming for Syria under USAID\u2019s $274 million fund for countries affected by coronavirus.\n\nThe threat of an outbreak could also thaw Syria\u2019s relations with several countries in the region, and rally support for the Assad government. Last week, following the Group of 20 summit, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed extended the UAE\u2019s support for the Syrian people in his first call with the Syrian president since a 2011 break in bilateral ties.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOther parts of Syria lack health-care services\n\nMy research suggests Syria\u2019s opposition-held areas face a dire threat without the proper resources to prevent the spread of the disease \u2014 or even identify it. In Idlib, nearly 3 million Syrians are particularly vulnerable, particularly the 1 million living in crowded camps along the Turkish border.\n\nThe World Health Organization has shipped 300 test kits to the city of Idlib, and promised to supply an additional 2,000 tests, and a testing lab at Idlib Central Hospital will begin testing this week. The WHO will deploy an additional 1,000 health-care workers and as many as 10,000 masks and 500 respirators to the city and surrounding areas to run the emergency response and testing process in the few remaining clinics and hospitals.\n\nAD\n\nBut tests alone won\u2019t be sufficient to prevent the spread of coronavirus, particularly in densely populated displacement camps. Many in these camps already lack shelter, and access to water and food. The simplest preventive actions \u2014 quarantine, washing hands, disinfecting \u2014 are not available options for most displaced Syrians. Any coronavirus outbreak would probably prove fatal for hundreds of thousands of civilians, particularly the elderly and those with chronic illnesses.\n\nAD\n\nThe compounding needs in Idlib suggest extensive multilateral support will be needed for logistics and delivery of medical services to respond to coronavirus cases, in addition to a comprehensive response from emergency aid providers to address existing shortages of food, water, shelter and other daily essentials. However, hope for such an outcome is grim as major donor countries \u2014 the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union countries \u2014 address their own coronavirus crises.\n\nNortheast Syria has few hospitals\n\nIn northeast Syria, the Kurdish-led administration initiated a curfew ordered the closure of businesses, restaurants and events. The border with the rest of Syria is now closed, other than cross-border aid deliveries from Damascus. Only one of 16 hospitals in the region is fully functional. Two additional hospitals identified to quarantine and treat patients, are underequipped, with only 28 beds for intensive care, 11 ventilators, and two doctors trained to use them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOngoing disputes between Turkish-held groups and the SDF exacerbate the situation. On March 24, Turkish-backed groups shut off water to the city of Al-Hasakeh, creating increased risks of coronavirus and other disease outbreaks for some 460,000 residents, including tens of thousands living in the Al-Hol displacement camp.\n\nThe immediate challenge for Northeast Syria is access to outside coronavirus experts. While WHO officials can reach Idlib via U.N.-approved borders, they cannot cross from Iraq into northeast Syria. The push by China and Russia to end the Syria cross-border aid mechanism under Resolution 2449 in January left the northeast out of reach of U.N. assistance.\n\nObtaining testing kits and expanding the region\u2019s health-care capacity depends heavily on whether the WHO can access northeast Syria from Damascus, a process that historically has been fraught with political challenges for U.N. agencies. The U.N. Security Council could opt to grant WHO authorization for cross-border assistance at all official crossings \u2014 allowing aid to arrive via Iraq and Jordan. This might give the peripheral areas of Syria access to lifesaving medical care as the coronavirus spreads \u2014 which seems inevitable, given the experience of other countries.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nIt will take more than a nationwide cease-fire to prevent a covid-19 disaster in Syria. The WHO hopefully will be able to coordinate a response with government and nonstate groups that addresses all of Syria\u2019s medical needs, despite the country\u2019s geographic and political fragmentation, deteriorating health-care infrastructure and lack of government resources. Otherwise, regions outside of government-held areas will be underprepared to face the crisis.\n\nJesse Marks is an associate with the University of Cambridge\u2019s Centre for the Study of Global Human Movement and Schwarzman Scholar at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

But independent reports and accounts from doctors suggest the real number is much higher than Damascus will admit.\n\nNortheast Syria, as with the rebel-held northwest, hasn\u2019t yet reported any cases of the virus, but officials are bracing for a wave of infections they fear will overwhelm their war-battered health system.\n\n\u201cThere is a shortage of everything now,\u201d said Mehmud Bro, deputy minister for the Social Affairs and Labor office in the self-administration. \u201cMedicines, sterile materials and masks are scarce, and the World Health Organization is moving very slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would be an unimaginable catastrophe in the event of a coronavirus outbreak,\u201d he added.\n\nEven before the threat of coronavirus, the Kurdish-majority region was dealing with a shortage of supplies and testing. Faced with a veto threat from Russia, the UN Security Council voted in January to seal the border crossing from which 40% of northeast\u2019s medical provisions were supplied.\n\nIn a region where an estimated 1.6 million people rely on humanitarian assistance, there are just 28 intensive care unit beds, 11 ventilators and two doctors trained to use them, according to the International Rescue Committee. Of the northeast\u2019s 16 hospitals, only one is fully functioning.\n\n\u201cHospitals and medical centers are only providing primary medical care. They cannot provide holistic and comprehensive care for citizens. So imagine how it would be if people were infected with COVID-19?\u201d said Dr. Joan Mustafa, co-chair of the Health Authority.\n\nThe only testing facility was rendered out of service during Turkey\u2019s military operation against the US-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Defense Forces in October, which also forced aid organizations to pull out and displaced some 200,000 residents.\n\nIn the absence of COVID-19 tests, authorities are identifying possible cases with basic temperature checks, as well as using leftover test kits they would normally use for things like polio and HIV, the Rojava Information Center told Al-Monitor. They\u2019re also using tests provided by a Swedish nongovernmental organization that use spit to determine a person\u2019s white blood cell count and detect certain proteins.\n\nSamples from about 20 of these suspected cases, according to Bro, were sent off to a laboratory in regime-held Damascus where results can take as long as a week. All have so far come back negative.\n\nA big fear among Kurdish officials and aid workers are the thousands living in crowded camps and informal settlements where access to clean, running water for hand washing is limited and social distancing all-but-impossible. Highly vulnerable to an outbreak is al-Hol camp in Hasakah, where some 70,000 displaced people, including Islamic States members and their families, are packed into squalid tents.\n\n\u201cThe immunity of the residents of the camps is weaker due to their nutrition. There is no type of vegetables or fruits in their diet at all,\u201d Bro said. \u201cThe situation is very scary\u201d\n\nKurdish officials have responded to the coronavirus threat by sealing their territory\u2019s border with Iraqi Kurdistan and enforcing a two-week curfew they say can be extended \u201cin case of necessity and the public interest.\u201d\n\nIn the United States, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo recently announced $274 million in emergency funding for countries particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus, $16.8 million of which is allocated for Syria.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['11 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

There is no running water, soap is expensive and hand sanitizer is an unaffordable luxury. She cannot even imagine what social distancing for her family of 16 would look like in the three tents they share in a makeshift camp near the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\n\"We try with our limited capabilities to keep clean. All those sanitizers, cleaning materials that you are talking about, we can't get,\" Um Ali tells CNN.\n\nShe lives in one of the many camps that have cropped up in the fields, olive groves, and rolling hills of Syria's rebel-held Idlib province. Most of the children have runny noses from exposure to harsh living conditions.\n\nThe family has dodged death multiple times over the course of the ongoing nine-year conflict in Syria. They fled a regime assault in Hama province when the war began in 2011, moving from one town to the next as the fighting dragged on.\n\nFatima Um Ali's family has run away from danger throughout Syria's nine-year war, but with barely any water or hygiene items, they struggle to keep away the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut they can't run away from the global pandemic. COVID-19 is heading toward the war-ravaged province like a \"slow moving tsunami,\" the World Health Organization says, and could claim tens of thousands of lives.\n\nIdlib's population of 3 million, already buckling under extreme shortages of medicine, is considered to be one of the world's most defenseless against the virus.\n\nMedical facilities in Idlib have been decimated in targeted airstrikes over the years. Doctors are already overstretched and hospital beds are in short supply. A brutal Syrian government offensive -- propped up by Russia and Iran -- that was launched in December added more pressure on the flailing healthcare facilities. The latest string of attacks also displaced nearly 1 million people, cramming the growing influx of families into sprawling camps with no infrastructure and increasingly unsanitary conditions.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis could culminate in an unparalleled health crisis when COVID-19 reaches Syria's northwest, says Dr. Munther Khalil from the opposition-controlled Idlib Health Directorate (IHD).\n\n\"We don't know if we have the coronavirus yet, but we are expecting a tsunami with a high death toll because of the lack of medical infrastructure,\" he says.\n\nWe don't know if we have the coronavirus yet, but we are expecting a tsunami with a high death toll because of the lack of medical infrastructure Dr. Munther Khalil\n\nMedics are raising awareness about hygiene requirements, but it's a hard sell for a population reeling from the effects of war. \"They have been through bombs, freezing to death, chemical attacks, so they are already resigned to death,\" Khalil said.\n\nIdlib has only 1.4 doctors per 10,000 people, according to the IHD. Hospitals are already running at over-capacity, with an average 150% occupancy rate, according to the IHD. There are only around 100 adult ventilators in opposition-held parts of Syria, which includes Idlib and sections of the countryside of nearby provinces, and fewer than 200 ICU beds.\n\nDr. Mohammed Shahem Makki is the only person in Syria's rebel-held territories who can carry out tests.\n\nWhen COVID-19 spreads through the rebel enclave, more than 100,000 people could die, according to Khalil.\n\nThe Early Warning and Alert Response Network (EWARN), the only disease surveillance group operating in this part of Syria, says that between 40 and 70% of the population could get infected, based on global transmission rates.\n\nAccording to those estimates, at least 1.2 million people in Idlib could contract COVID19, explains Dr. Naser Mhawish, the surveillance coordinator of EWARN.\n\nTesting for the coronavirus, another key component of the battle against the spread of the pandemic, has been slow to start.\n\nIn all of opposition-held Syria, only one doctor and one device can carry out tests for the virus. After weeks of waiting, 300 tests privately purchased by EWARN from a Turkish manufacturer arrived at the Idlib Central Hospital's laboratory on Wednesday. So far, they have tested four suspected cases -- all turned out negative.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said that it will also deliver some testing kits to opposition-held Syria. So far, these have not arrived, according to medical professionals in the enclave.\n\nThe organization has come under criticism for its slow response to the possibility of the pandemic hitting opposition-held areas, while making a delivery of the tests to Damascus.\n\n\"Corona(virus) and after corona(virus) -- the suffering in this area will continue and nobody will do what they have to do to stop this catastrophe,\" Khalil says. \"In general we think that the WHO and some donors they don't care a lot about this area.\"\n\nThe country's ongoing civil war has complicated the emergency health response, according to WHO's acting Regional Emergency Director Rick Brennan.\n\nWe are busting our guts to make sure everything is ready. Rick Brennan\n\n\"The delay in supplying test kits to northwest Syria does not imply any favoring of one side of the conflict over the other, as some may choose to interpret it,\" Brennan says.\n\n\"We are busting our guts to make sure everything is ready,\" he says.\n\nEven in government-controlled parts of Syria, capacity for testing remains low. The country has reported only five confirmed cases, but experts expect a bigger spread.\n\nThe White Helmets, accustomed to rescuing people from the rubble and dodging bombardment, are now facing off with the new coronavirus.\n\nDamascus has received 1,200 testing kits from the WHO. According to the organization's Damascus representative, Dr. Nima Saeed Abid, 300 of these were used.\n\nAll of Syria is considered by the WHO to be a very high risk country in the event of the pandemic's outbreak. It has the largest population of internally displaced people in the world and its war has dealt a major blow to its health sector.\n\nThe White Helmets rescue group, officially known as Syria Civil Defense, are once again on the frontlines. Accustomed to pulling people from rubble as airstrikes pummel towns, the rescuers are now trying on hazmat suits.\n\n\"This pandemic is making my mind busy all the time, our work has been changed now and this is something that we are not used to do,\" says Laith Abdullah, a White Helmets volunteer.\n\nThe group has been retraining its volunteers to combat a new, invisible assailant. White Helmets volunteers have been disinfecting schools, IDP shelters and camps as a preventative measure against the spread of the virus. They have also helped set up quarantine facilities with limited resources.\n\n\"I am worried and have anxiety now because of the possibility of our capacity being divided while we face the coronavirus and a possible Syrian regime operation at the same time,\" says Ahmad Abu al-Nour, another volunteer.\n\nOne key humanitarian effort in Idlib is to raise awareness about preventative measures to contain the spread of the virus. The Turkish aid organization IHH has been going from tent to tent explaining containment measures for coronavirus. Other local NGOs have also been doing similar work. But without basic infrastructure, there is little that leaflets touting the importance of hand washing can do.\n\nBack at the makeshift camp, Fatima Um Ali walks out of her tent and points to an empty blue plastic barrel. It's her family's allotment of water. A water truck is meant to come to the camp once a day to distribute water. But today the water tanker hasn't arrived, and the barrel is empty.\n\n\"When someone has been through everything we have been through from being displaced to bombardments, do you think that a virus would make that much of a difference?\" Um Ali says.\n\nShe is resigned to her fate and has decided to cling to her faith.\n\n\"I am afraid that we will get sick just like everyone else in the world,\" she says.\n\n\"But I am also not afraid because in God I trust.\"","tests":"['300 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":"['200 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Personal protective equipment has also been distributed to 21 health care facilities but the Idlib Health Directorate is urging the UN agency to ramp up aid and provide \"urgently-needed ventilators, protective gear for medical staff and hand sanitiser to overcrowded camps.\"\n\nDetainees 'left to face the virus alone'\n\nThe UN Special Envoy to Syria, Geir O.

The developers are also in early-stage talks for local manufacturing sites to be set up in other parts of the continent.\n\n\"When COVID-19 hit, we knew from the beginning that Africa would be disproportionally affected,\" Joe Fitchett, the medical director of Mologic told Al Jazeera. \"With a test like this, you can detect [the virus] very quickly on any part of the continent and then avoid transmission.\"\n\nTo detect as many people as possible, Fitchett says the test will be sold at cost-price - which is approximately $1 - thanks to grant support from the UK government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\"The point is to keep it to the bottom,\" Fitchett said, adding they would work with suppliers to keep the price as low as possible.\n\nGame-changer?\n\nCOVID-19, the highly infectious respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has no vaccine or known treatment.\n\nUntil a vaccine is ready, widespread testing is seen as one of the most important strategies used to \"flatten the curve\" - slowing the spread of the contagion in an attempt to prevent already stretched healthcare systems from being overrun.\n\n200319085112877\n\nEarlier this month, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged countries to build up their testing capacity to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, calling them to \"test, test, test\".\n\n\"The most effective way to prevent infections and save lives is breaking the chains of transmission. And to do that, you must test and isolate,\" he told reporters in Geneva. \"You cannot fight a fire blindfolded. And we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected.\"\n\nWith tests at advanced, centralised laboratories still costly and taking hours to complete, dozens of companies worldwide are working to develop rapid, easy-to-use kits and distribute them widely - but questions remain over their accuracy.\n\nPrice and availability, however, are not the only barriers to widespread use. By developing a test that can be done at home without any need for electricity, the researchers in Senegal say it can be of particular use in rural communities where power is limited, and laboratories are near inaccessible.\n\nTheir test can be done in two different ways - using saliva or blood. Those with an active infection would use a saliva swab to detect the new coronavirus, while those with a previously undetected case would use an at-home finger prick test to check for coronavirus antibodies.\n\nThere are currently more than 2,800 confirmed cases in 45 of the continent's 54 countries. While that is still significantly lower than the current epicentre in Europe, some analysts fear Africa is on course to follow a similar trajectory.\n\nSuch a scenario would spell disaster in a continent that accounts for 1 percent of global health expenditure but carries 23 percent of the disease burden. Weaker health systems, poor sanitation and water shortages are just some of the additional challenges that would make it harder to fight the virus.\n\nThe Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has significantly ramped up its prevention strategy in recent weeks, training labs in 43 countries, a swift increase from only two countries that were able to test for the disease in February. It has also been providing 1,000 test kits to any country with cases. Chinese billionaire Jack Ma donated an additional 1.1 million test kits. But that still is only a drop in the bucket compared with what will be needed.\n\n\"In times like these, it's difficult for African governments to purchase tests which are also cheaper and cost-effective,\" Prashant Yadav, a global supply chain analyst at the Center for Global Health, told Al Jazeera.\n\nThat is why he says the continent having a test of its own could be a game-changer. \"You're giving people on the continent access to a new test which very other few groups have had access to,\" Yadav said.\n\nIndependent assessment critical\n\nPrototypes for the diagnostic test are now being assessed by two laboratories in the UK; the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and St George's University London. Additional tests have been sent for independent assessment at labs around the world, including Senegal, Spain, China, Malaysia and Brazil.\n\n200323065933020\n\nThe development of the prototype comes less than three weeks after Mologic was awarded one million British pounds ($1.2m) from the UK government as part of a 46-million British pound ($56m) fund for international coronavirus prevention and research. That is lightning-fast for a diagnostic test, which typically takes years to develop.\n\nFitchett credited Mologic's partnership with the Pasteur Institute in Dakar for speeding up the process.\n\nAt the same time, he emphasised the importance of following all proper validation procedures.\n\n\"Independent assessment is so critical, which is why we're working with top labs on every continent,\" Fitchett said. \"It's not in our interest to send something out that's no good.\"\n\nAuthorities have been cracking down on a rise in fake testing kits being distributed, often sold at a high markup, as people around the world search desperately to get tested amidst shortages.","tests":"['1,000 test kits']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

As you might be aware, the virus is described as circular with spikes on top. So it is these spikes that we disintegrated in the sorting room and we are left with the RNA inside the shell, which we now want to extract.\"\n\nHe said after extraction, the RNA is taken to the detection machine, which then proves that the extracted RNA is indeed Covid-19 or that is not.\n\nClose Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Coronavirus Health Governance By submitting above, you agree to our privacy policy.

Once we have our RNA, we then mix it with the detection kits in this machine to get the results. This machine can run up to 93 samples at a time,\" said Mr Takawira.\n\nThe process from sorting of samples to detection of the virus plus other administrative issues takes up to six hours before results are sent back to the requesting clinician.\n\nAll results are confirmed at the NMRL, whose process was described as gold standard and one in use globally.\n\nNMRL acting coordinator Mr Exevia Mazarura said so far they were managing to run all specimens within the stipulated time frames, but should the need to exceed the capacity of existing equipment arise, the laboratory has other machines, which have been approved by WHO to conduct Covid-19 tests.\n\nThe machines include the Hologic Panther and Abbort M2000, which are being used to run viral load tests for HIV.\n\nThe country has 10 Abbort M2000 machines in the provinces and three Hologic Panther machines. GeneExpert machines, which are dotted across the country's provinces and districts would be used for Covid-19 tests.\n\n\"Once the required reagents for these machines are procured, they all should be able to conduct Covid-19 tests,\" said Mr Mazarura.\n\nIn addition to Government facilities, Government has also roped in private health institutions to conduct similar tests.","tests":"['19 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Uganda joined South Africa and others in the lockdown category of countries after president Museveni spelt out raft of measures aimed at helping halt the spread of the virus.\n\nMarch 30: Kenya wants MPs tested, lockdown experiences\n\nKenya\u2019s lower parliamentary chamber wants some 50 lawmakers to be tested for coronavirus amid fears they may have contracted the virus from a member who recently tested positive, the Daily Nation newspaper reports\n\nLocal media reports say the parliament has submitted the names of MPs and parliamentary staff it wants tested to the health ministry. It wants them placed on mandatory quarantine as well.\n\nThe MP who tested positive is believed to have contracted the virus from a county governor who had returned from Germany on a working visit. Kenya currently has 50 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with two deaths.\n\nMeanwhile Ghana and Zimbabwe joined the list of African countries enforcing lockdowns to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Zimbabwe is in a nationwide lockdown like in South Africa and Namibia. Zimbabwe has seven cases with one death.\n\nOver in Ghana where confirmed cases are gone past 150, government has placed lockdowns on two major regions. The Greater Accra and Ashanti regions where cases have been recorded.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s lockdown enforcement has been the subject of widespread criticism after security agents were seen assaulting unarmed citizens some of them within their compounds.

Guateng and Western Cape provinces remained the most impacted with 548 and 310 cases respectively.\n\n\u201cIt is with sadness that we announce the second death of a patient who had tested positive for COVID-19. The 74 year old male had been in ICU and ventilation in a private hospital in Ladysmith.\n\n\u201cHe had travelled to Kruger National Park with his family and came back with flu like symptoms. He was confirmed to be COVID-19 positive on the 27th March 2020,\u201d the statement signed by Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize read.\n\nCases continue to rise across Africa. Uganda recorded 10 cases over the weekend bringing the tally to 33. Ethiopia\u2019s tally now stands at 21. Kenya now has 42 confirmed cases, the Health Minister confirmed on Sunday. Eritrea recorded a 100% raise in cases from six to 12 as at Sunday.\n\nNairobi County continues to lead with 31 cases of those who have so far tested positive, followed by Kilifi with six, Mombasa with three, while Kajiado and Kwale with one each. Out of the 42 positive cases, 24 are male while 18 are female.\n\nGovernment has announced that the ministry\u2019s medical teams have embarked on mass testing for all persons who arrived in the country last week, and are currently under mandatory quarantine in various designated hotels and government facilities.\n\nMarch 28: Rwanda, Lagos State support vulnerable\n\nThe Rwandan government on Saturday, March 28, kick started a support initiative aimed at vulnerable families adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown. Rwanda currently has 60 confirmed cases.\n\nPresident Paul Kagame had in a national address late last week highlighted the resolve of government to do everything possible to support vulnerable Rwandans during the lockdown citing its social and economic challenges.\n\nThe hard-hit Rwandans living in urban centres without a salaried income are the most affected. The initiative kicked-off in some parts of the three districts of Kigali, state-run New Times said.\n\nThe food relief is being drawn from the country\u2019s National Strategic Grain Reserve under the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources which is used in case of food shortage, the portal added.\n\nOver in Nigeria\u2019s commercial hub of Lagos, the state government announced an Emergency Food Response as a means of supporting indigenes and the vulnerable. Neighbouring Ekiti State has announced a similar measures.\n\n\u201cWe are all aware that this is a trying time for our citizens and since the partial drop in economic activities, our government deemed it necessary to reach out to the vulnerable ones in the society,\u201d Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said.\n\nFor his part, Ekiti State governor, Kayode Fayemi, issued a new set of Executive Order with a raft of\n\norders which included reactivating the State\u2019s food bank to support the vulnerable.\n\n\u201cI have directed that the Ekiti State Food Bank be reactivated immediately to provide food items to the poor and vulnerable families in our communities. The Task Force will announce the modalities as soon as the process is fully activated.\n\n\u201cThe State Government will consider providing a stipend to our self-employed citizens whose daily income will be interrupted at this time as subsidy for their loss of income,\u201d the order read in part.\n\nMarch 27: Lesotho to lockdown on Saturday\n\nDespite being among Africa\u2019s virus-free nations, Lesotho Prime Minister Tom Thabane, has announced a lockdown starting from Saturday, March 28, South African portal Eye Witness News reports.\n\nThe Mountain Kingdom landlocked by South Africa has not recorded any confirmed COVID-19 cases. It relies on South Africa to help with testing as it does not have the capacity to do so.\n\nBut on Friday, Ethiopian Airlines delivered coronavirus (COVID-19) test kits, masks, and protective suits donated by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma. The consignment arrived a day earlier than expected.\n\nLesotho\u2019s ambassador to the African Union Mafa Sejanamane said delivery of the consignment was moved forward to ensure that it didn\u2019t clash with South Africa\u2019s national lockdown.\n\nMeanwhile South Africa has revised the death toll of two to one after Health Minister Mkhize said one of the two persons announced earlier on Friday did not die of the virus.\n\nThe lockdown took effect with largely reports of obedience but also defiance in parts of the country leading security forces to make arrests and force others out of the streets. South Africa is Africa\u2019s most impacted country with over 1,000 cases so far.\n\nZimbabwe\u2019s President Emmerson Mnangagwa also announced late Friday that the country will go into lockdown from Monday, March 30, in an effort to control the spread of coronavirus.\n\nSo far, the country has recorded five cases and one death, 30-year-old journalist Zororo Makamba. The low number of cases though \u201cneed not induce complacency\u201d, Mr Mnangagwa said in an address to the nation.\n\nFor three weeks from Monday, Zimbabweans will be required to stay at home, except to buy food and access vital health services.\n\nThe southern African country is allowing the use of the US dollars again, reversing last year\u2019s ban on foreign currencies \u2013 a move aimed at supporting the already struggling economy against the effects of coronavirus.\n\nSome key headlines you will have details of as you scroll down_\n\nDRC capital Kinshasa readies for first 4-day lockdown\n\ncapital Kinshasa readies for first 4-day lockdown South Africa tally hits 927, Kenya records first death\n\nSomalia records second case\n\nSouth Africa president tests negative\n\nSouth Africa figures on the rise as lockdown looms\n\nLibya and Mali record index cases\n\nSierra Leone tests suspected case, Ivory Coast figures jump\n\nNigeria cases hit 40, South Africa entering national lockdown\n\nCases rise above 1,400 with 40+ deaths\n\nSouth Africa tally hits 274, Botswana president in self-isolation\n\nKenya records eight new case\n\nMozambique records index case\n\nEritrea, Uganda record index cases\n\nAfrica\u2019s tally heading towards 1,200\n\nMarch 27: Deaths in SA, lockdown in Kinshasa,\n\nSouth Africa entered a state of lockdown at midnight of March 26, hours later; Africa\u2019s most impacted country have reported the first two deaths from the coronavirus.\n\nPresident Ramaphosa flagged off the lockdown by tasking security forces to be a \u201cforce of kindness\u201d and to secure the interest of the 57 million citizens. Already there are reports that people flouting the measure have been arrested.\n\nHealth Minister Zwelini Mkhize announced on that the two deaths had occurred in the Western Cape province \u2013 one at a private hospital and the other at a public hospital.\n\nHe also announced that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had jumped to more than 1,000, but said the details would be given in a subsequent media briefing.\n\nIn DR Congo, the capital Kinshasa which is the most impacted part of the country has announced that from Saturday (March 27), the city will be on a four-day lockdown as part of measures to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nResidents would then be allowed to stock up on food in the following two days. The same pattern is scheduled to be repeated for the next three weeks.\n\nMeanwhile cases are rising across East Africa where Rwanda remains the most impacted with 50 cases as at March 26. Ethiopia recorded four more cases to bring the tally to 16 whiles Uganda now stands at 18. Kenya\u2019s last known tally was 31.\n\nMarch 26: Kenya records death, SA cases shoot\n\nKenya today confirmed its first death from the coronavirus disease with cases now at 31.

Many Zimbabweans are already vulnerable from hunger or underlying health issues like HIV, which is present in 12% of the population.\n\nLast year a United Nations expert called the number of hungry people in Zimbabwe \u201cshocking\u201d for a country not in conflict. The World Food Program has said more than 7 million people, or half the country, needs aid.\n\nHarare, like most cities and towns across Zimbabwe, has an acute water shortage and residents at times go for months, even years, without a working tap. Many must crowd communal wells, fearing the close contact will speed the coronavirus' spread.\n\n\u201cIf the taps were working we wouldn\u2019t be here, swarming the well like bees on a beehive or flies on sewage. We are busy exchanging coronavirus here coughing and spitting saliva at each other,\u201d said 18-year old Annastancia Jack while waiting her turn.\n\nThe government has closed borders and banned gatherings of more than 50 people while encouraging people to stay at home.\n\nBut the majority of Zimbabweans need to go out daily to put food on the table. With inflation over 500% most industries have closed, leaving many people to become street vendors. Zimbabwe has the world\u2019s second-largest informal economy after Bolivia, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nPolice in recent days have tried to clear vendors from the streets, in vain. As in other African countries where many people rely on informal markets, a lockdown could mean immediate food shortages.\n\nOnce-prosperous Zimbabwe was full of renewed promise with the forced resignation in late 2017 of longtime leader Robert Mugabe. But President Emmerson Mnangagwa has struggled to fulfil promises of prosperity since taking power. He blames the country's crisis in part on sanctions imposed on certain individuals, including himself, by the U.S. over rights abuses.\n\nDaily necessities in Zimbabwe make social distancing an elusive ideal. In downtown Harare, hordes of people congregate at banks for cash, which is in short supply. Others pack public transport.\n\n\u201cWe are the only ones practicing social distancing, we sit in our cars all day,\u201d said Blessing Hwiribisha, a motorist in a fuel line snaking for more than a kilometer in the poor suburb of Kuwadzana.\n\n\u201cLook at them,\u201d he said. He pointed at a supermarket across the road where hundreds of people shoved to buy maize meal, which has become scarce due to a devastating drought and lack of foreign currency to import more.\n\n\u201cWhat is happening in Zimbabwe is very scary. It\u2019s like we are playing cards. Its either you win coronavirus or you win starvation,\" said Tinashe Moyo at the supermarket. \"I am very scared.\"\n\nFew health workers are available as doctors and nurses strike.\n\n\u201cThere is a difference between being heroic and being suicidal,\u201d said Tawanda Zvakada, president of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association.\n\nHealth workers described a lack of disinfectants, sanitizers and even water at hospitals.\n\nAnd yet Health Minister Obadiah Moyo repeatedly says Zimbabwe is \u201cwell prepared\u201d to deal with COVID-19 cases.\n\nBut frightened health workers cited the death of a prominent broadcaster at an ill-equipped isolation center specifically reserved for COVID-19 cases.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have a ventilator to help him,\u201d Zvakada said. \u201cThe inability of our system to manage one patient is worrying. What about when there are 50 patients?\u201d\n\nZimbabwe has has less than 20 ventilators to help people in severe respiratory distress, he said. He said the country needs hundreds to adequately deal with the virus.\n\n\u201cWe see a situation where Zimbabwe can become a graveyard if we are not careful,\u201d said Itai Rusike, director of the Harare-based Community Working Group on Health.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['20 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

The issue of testing has led for calls for the ministry to much more quickly identify people who have the flu-like virus.\n\nA couple of youths wearing masks to protect against the spread of the new coronavirus walk in the streets of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Monday, March 23, 2020. Dieu Nalio Chery AP\n\nThis is not the first time that Zanmi Lasante, which runs the 320-bed University Hospital in Mirebalais under the guidance of renowned medical anthropologist and infectious disease expert Dr. Paul Farmer, has been willing to go out on a limb in the name of the Haitian population during its 30-year-plus existence.\n\nSimilar decisions about screenings and treatment were made by the nonprofit healthcare provider in the \u201880s and \u201890s in regard to HIV\/AIDS and tuberculosis, and in the past decade in response to the cholera epidemic after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nThe University Hospital in Mirebalais is one of the few health facilities in Haiti currently equipped to care for patients sickened by the coronavirus, and received Haiti\u2019s first two positive COVID-19 patients, both of whom have since recovered. It also runs other healthcare facilities and works on the Haiti-Dominican border, where thousands of Haitians have crossed unchecked since both nations closed the border last month to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nCampa said Zanmi Lasante is aware that \u201cthe gold standard\u201d remains the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR test, which is more accurate but much slower and can take days to get results. Any positive cases found through the 15-minute rapid test will then be transferred over for PCR testing, she said.\n\nDoctors divided about benefits of rapid testing\n\nThe use of rapid testing in the battle to stop the spread of COVID-19 remains a divisive one among clinicians and public health specialists. During Monday\u2019s coronavirus briefing in Port-au-Prince, Dr. Patrick Dely, who is responsible for the ministry\u2019s epidemiology and laboratory section, addressed the rapid testing debate.\n\n\u201cEvery country adopts measures that goes with their reality; their means and the resources they have, \u201d Dely said. \u201cYour response cannot be based on what you see others are doing.\u201d\n\nDely said there are three types of tests that can be done to detect the coronavirus. But given the studies on both the rapid antibody and antigen tests, the country runs the risk of missing 40 percent of positive cases with a false negative result. Haiti, he said, has chosen to go the more accurate route of the polymerase chain reaction, which only its National Laboratory is currently entrusted to do. The lab he said, has the capacity to run about 800 tests a day.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this direction. Reginald Boulos, a Haitian businessman and physician with a master\u2019s in public health, said given the reality of the country and the ministry\u2019s own admission that Haiti now has community transmission, \u201cit\u2019s unrealistic to think that we can continue to do\u201d the PCR tests\n\nThe country, he said, needs to employ the South Korea model, where face masks in public are mandatory and the crisis is being managed by \u201ctesting, testing testing\u201d with a rapid antigen test. Unlike the antibody tests Zanmi Lasante plans to use to show the prevalence of the disease in communities, Boulos believes the antigen test provides more accuracy.\n\n\u201cWe need to change approach; coronavirus cannot be a clinical approach and this is what we\u2019re doing right now. We need a public health approach in Haiti; not just a clinician to have a nice laboratory being able to do 200 tests after three weeks. What does that say for a country with 10 million people?\u201d Boulos said. \u201cWe are not testing the country. We aren\u2019t really testing the people who we should be testing. People don\u2019t even know where to go and get tested.\u201d\n\nMore testing coming in Haiti\n\nBoulos said the Association of Automotive Importers recently donated $80,000 to expand testing in Haiti and increase the number of beds for COVID-19 patients. The donation went to GHESKIO, a research, treatment and training facility in Port-au-Prince, which had been seeking $200,000 for its COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cWe made one condition: to increase the 1,000 tests to 2,500 and [Dr. William Pape] has agreed to that,\u201d GHESKIO said.\n\nPape, the founder of GHESKIO, confirmed the donation, which he said will not go toward the purchase of rapid tests but the more accurate PCR tests.\n\nThe rapid test \u201cis a catastrophe,\u201d said Pape, who is a member of the scientific committee put in place by Haitian President Jovenel Mo\u00efse on the country\u2019s COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cIf they were used we would hospitalize many patients who do not need to occupy unnecessary beds. At the same time, we would tell people who are infected that they are not and they would go around infecting others.\u201d Pape said. \u201cThe PCR test we are using is very accurate.\u201d\n\nA passenger in a tap-tap wears a mask to protect against the spread of the new coronavirus, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Monday, March 23, 2020. Dieu Nalio Chery AP\n\nPape said the ministry of health is right to follow the WHO\/PAHO recommendations to only test people documented by a trained epidemiologist to have signs and symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe nurse performing the test is highly exposed and must be properly protected, trained and certified. This is the best strategy when you have limited testing kits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, Pape said, has ordered more test kits but they are not available for sale outside the U.S. Kits approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been ordered from South Korea, but the real issue is that test kits are sold separately from extraction agents, which are essential to conduct the test. There is a global shortage of extraction agents.\n\nIn addition to the donation by the Haitian private sector, Pape said the dean of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York \u201chas graciously collected for us all extraction agents from their research labs\u201d as well as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.\n\n\u201cThis should all arrive early this week to increase tremendously our capacity to perform tests in Haiti,\u201d he said. \u201cMany more testing sites are being set up.\u201d","tests":"['1,000 tests', '200 tests', '257 tests', '800 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

What does that say for a country with 10 million people?\u201d\n\nFor the latest on the coronavirus, check out BET\u2019s blog on the virus, and contact your local health department or visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.","tests":"['200 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

But those key players say they\u2019re being undermined by the Ministry of Public Health and Population, which is leading the national response to the pandemic.\n\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n\nAccording to some healthcare providers in Haiti, the government is dragging its feet on everything from allowing rapid testing to contact tracing to involving non-government healthcare facilities in its response.\n\nHaiti\u2019s official statistics tell a troubling story. The nation of 11 million has so far only tested 218 people for the deadly coronavirus and has 20 confirmed positive cases. By comparison, the Dominican Republic, which has roughly the same population as Haiti, has run more than 4,000 tests, and reported 1,488 positive cases and 68 deaths. It has also said it\u2019s seeing community transmission.\n\nDr. Franck G\u00e9n\u00e9us, the head of the country\u2019s association of private hospitals, said the decision by the French Hospital is a sign of things to come if the government doesn\u2019t get its act together. He has publicly accused the ministry of not doing enough to involve private hospitals in its COVID-19 response plan.\n\n\u201cIn two, three weeks, the health care system in Haiti will be brought to its knees,\u201d G\u00e9n\u00e9us said.\n\nFor weeks, nonprofits like Zanmi Lasante, which runs the country\u2019s largest functioning hospital, the 320-bed University Hospital of Mirebalais, and Innovating Health International, have been asking the ministry whether they can use 15-minute rapid tests to help detect COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the flu-like virus. So far they have received no response even though both have access to testing kits.\n\n\u201cHaiti desperately needs testing and rapid testing because half of all cases are asymptomatic,\u201d said Dr. Vincent DeGennaro, founder of Innovating Health International. \u201cThe USA failed miserably in testing and understanding our epidemic. We can\u2019t let Haiti repeat those mistakes. Rapid tests should be used for screening and surveillance, neither or which is practical or feasible with swab tests.\u201d\n\nThe issue of rapid testing remains controversial, with some doctors arguing that the lack of accuracy and knowledge over how and when to use them could create more problems than they solve. Others say that given that a significant portion of all COVID-19 cases are asymptomatic, rapid testing allows for massive screenings of the population and for quickly detecting the depth of the epidemic in the population.\n\nAshley Baldwin, a spokeswoman with the Pan American Health Organization, said rapid testing still \u201cneeds to be evaluated and is not currently recommended for clinical diagnosis pending more evidence on test performance and operational utility.\u201d\n\nBut some countries are using the tests in order to try to figure out the prevalence of the disease in their societies. Carlos Suero, the spokesman for the Dominican Republic\u2019s Ministry of Health, said the country has a stock of 12,000 rapid tests for the coronavirus. While not relying on them as the principal diagnostic tool, health officials are hoping they will have some use monitoring and controlling the spread of the outbreak.\n\nSince they first received the rapid tests on March 27, they\u2019ve been using them on first responders who have already been tested using the slower but more accurate polymerase chain reaction tests.\n\n\u201cStarting Saturday we\u2019re rolling them out nationally and concentrating on the hot spots,\u201d he said.\n\nDr. Laur\u00e9 Adrien, the director general of Haiti\u2019s Ministry of Public Health and Population, said officials are proceeding cautiously for a reason. The ministry wants to be careful so Haiti doesn\u2019t end up with a batch of counterfeit tests, which have already been identified in Spain.\n\nThe ministry, he said, is willing to go the route of rapid massive screenings, but \u201cit is first necessary to ensure the specificity, the sensitivity,\u201d and accuracy of the tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new virus, therefore with new tests, we must be vigilant,\u201d Adrien said. \u201cIn addition we must also ensure the ability of laboratories to perform reliable (quality control). We hope very soon to have more tests and especially more screening points in the country.\u201d\n\nAdrien pushed back on criticism by G\u00e9n\u00e9us and others that private institutions are not part of the response. G\u00e9n\u00e9us, he said, \u201cknows that the response plan includes everyone\u201d and has been part of the meetings as head of the association of private hospitals.\n\nAdrien said some private hospitals in Haiti have an expectation that the health ministry will be giving personal protective equipment to everyone. But this will not be the case. The government first needs to know which hospitals are in position to receive and care for COVID-19 patients, and then the institutions need to provide an inventory of their needs.\n\n\u201cThe country does not have a huge amount of PPE; our orders are not yet fully met,\u201d he said.\n\nHaiti, which recently ordered $18 million in medical equipment and gear from China, according to its prime minister, will distribute the equipment as soon as it is available, Adrien said.\n\nHe said another problem with the private hospitals in the country is that while they have nurses and administrative staff, they rarely have doctors assigned to them, further complicating care and the ability to respond to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cThese hospitals must also tell us how many nursing staff they have and the estimate of their needs,\u201d said Adrien. \u201cWe must know the operations of private hospitals in Haiti. ... The state does not want to repeat the experience that private hospitals lived after the [2010] earthquake where most were decapitalized or even closed. So we need a support plan and to ensure the feasibility and compliance with this plan.\u201d\n\nBut time remains of the essence, say healthcare workers in Haiti. Even before the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the hemisphere, Haiti was already facing challenges with its weak health system. Ten years after the deadly earthquake that killed more than 300,000 Haitians, the largest public hospital still hasn\u2019t been completed and most of the existing public facilities are poorly equipped. Strikes are also a common occurrence.\n\nThe health ministry, meanwhile, has been criticized for its lack of transparency in relaying the information on confirmed COVID-19 cases and whether they are travel related or community spread. It has also been slow on contact tracing \u2014 a key component in stopping the spread of the virus.\n\nLast week, for example, two people were finally contacted almost two weeks after returning from Miami to be told that fellow airline passengers tested positive for the virus and they needed to be screened.\n\nThe day after the phone calls, the mayors of one of the most populated suburbs, Carrefour, took to the radio to blast health authorities after a pastor, who tested positive after arriving from Miami, fled one region of the country amid threats and showed up in his city with nine family members. The health ministry, Carrefour Mayor Jude Edouard Pierre said, needs to do a better job of inclusion.","tests":"['4,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The government has closed Haiti\u2019s border, ports, and airports to the movement of people but kept supply chains open. Only a small number of tests have been administered, and there are rising fears that a health catastrophe will unfold over the coming weeks and months.\n\nNews and commentaries inside the country spread quickly over WhatsApp and local media. Under mounting stress, many know they are wholly unprepared for a pandemic that has also arrived in other Caribbean countries, including the neighboring Dominican Republic.\n\nThe latest reports indicate that 859 people have tested positive in the Dominican Republic, with 39 deaths already. One of the country\u2019s main hospitals in the second largest city, Santiago de los Caballeros, reportedly no longer has beds available.\n\nMany families in Haiti have relatives residing in the Dominican Republic and receive updates regularly. The virus appears to have initially been brought to Haiti through Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. Since the first two cases, the official number rose to 15 by March 30, although that figure is surely an undercount. Dozens have been placed under quarantine.\n\nHaiti now faces a looming pandemic with an almost non-existent public healthcare system, and with a dysfunctional political system rooted in neocolonial intervention.\n\nThe Caribbean region has endured four centuries of slavery and colonialism and a fifth century of economic dependence. Accelerating globalization and technological developments have brought profound change to the region over the past 20 years, including no-cost digital communications, hi-tech remittance networks, low-cost mass travel and tourism, and new banking and financial arrangements. But it has also brought soaring inequality and climate shocks, mainly in the form of hurricanes and rising sea-levels.\n\nGlobalization and automation have caused billions of people to be cast into capitalism\u2019s surplus population. Under this system\u2019s relentless logic, vast portions of the world\u2019s people, even entire countries like Haiti, are condemned to rampant crime, unemployment, and inflation, alongside disintegrating infrastructure and government services. It sinks destructively into the social fabric of society.\n\nTo preserve social order and the neoliberal conception of \u201cgood governance,\u201d Western institutions resort to severe austerity measures and military intervention, further debilitating the neo-colony whose economic life-blood is being sucked out to enrich the transnational bourgeoisie.\n\nThis is the recipe that rendered Haiti completely unprepared for the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stark reality of Haiti\n\nUnemployment in Haiti is already sky-high. With 6 million of Haiti\u2019s 11 million citizens living below the poverty line of $2.41 a day, according to the World Bank, most will face a grueling dilemma of how to feed themselves and their families while avoiding virus infection.\n\nDr. John A. Carroll, who has worked in clinics, hospitals, and orphanages in Haiti since 1995, explained, \u201cThere is no treatment in Haiti that will be accessible by the masses. But there is quarantine to stop transmission. But how do we isolate people in the Haitian slum where the population density is so high and people need to have human contact in order to survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe breadwinners in the house need to score some bread because they all need to eat,\u201d Carroll continued. \u201cAnd this family\u2019s neighbors next door don\u2019t have the time or abilities to help out because they have equally severe challenges surviving the slum also.\u201c\n\nWhile the Haitian government is officially promoting confinement and social distancing, the stark reality is that most of the population are likely heading toward collective \u201cherd immunity,\u201d where many must choose to get infected in the street rather than die by hunger at home. Some, like Carroll, think that this steep, as opposed to flattened, infection curve will result in fewer deaths.\n\nBuilding \u201cherd immunity\u201d is an approach that the UK government actually suggested for its own people weeks ago, but quickly rejected as a result of a fierce public backlash. Instead, the British state has imposed \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures and \u2014 despite a right-wing government being in office \u2014 committed to pay the majority of the payroll costs of businesses whose workers stay home.\n\nOn March 29, local medical experts interviewed on Radio Kiskeya, one of the country\u2019s most important radio stations, suggested that up to 800,000 Haitians could perish from the virus. Large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to avert such a catastrophe.\n\nThe Grayzone spoke with Dr. Ernst No\u00ebl, of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMP) in Port-au-Prince, who stated that the number of 800,000 is not an exaggeration. In his view, many people will likely die due to Coronavirus, and in larger numbers than those that perished in the 2010 earthquake.\n\nHe added that large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to soften the blow of the oncoming disaster.\n\nTeetering on the edge of a meltdown\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Haiti\u2019s health-care system is ill-prepared for the looming catastrophe.\n\nAccording to Haiti\u2019s National Institute of Statistics, the country has only 911 doctors. A mere 4.4 percent of the national budget is allocated for national health, which translates to ill-equipped hospitals with woefully insufficient staff. State-run hospitals often face labor strikes, and some medical staff appear not to be showing up to work, as they are lacking masks, gloves, and gowns and fear contracting the virus.\n\nAccording to Haiti\u2019s most read newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, the country has only 130 ICU beds, and most of these are older models.\n\nDr. Paul Farmer, a co-founder of the Boston-based health care organization Partners in Health, has suggested Haiti may actually have fewer than 30 fully functioning ICU beds.\n\nMeanwhile there are an estimated 64 ventilators inside the country, though some are likely not working.\n\nDr. Farmer has pointed out how people living in the Global South face significantly more risk due to underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure:\n\n\u201cAll these mechanics of a hospital, we [in affluent nations] don\u2019t have to deal with them. The oxygen is piped right into every room. But the dread of responsibility for my coworkers in Haiti is that they have to worry: Where do we get the oxygen, the IV solutions, can we space the beds for intensive or supportive care in a way that doesn\u2019t infect the caregivers? And we\u2019ve exhausted a lot of supplies as health-care workers are more attentive to putting on gloves, changing gloves, gowning up. We\u2019re seeing real supply chain challenges.\u201d\n\nDoctors assigned to the State University of Haiti (HUEH), the country\u2019s biggest medical facility, have reportedly barely escaped from a suspected Covid-19 outbreak. They had not received personal protection equipment, nor did they get the test kits prescribed for testing coronavirus patients. Even running water is lacking in some medical facilities.\n\n#Haiti has less than 130 ICU beds for a population of more than 10 million.

He explained to The Grayzone that before the Covid-19 pandemic he had \u201cnever seen ventilators at the HUEH facility,\u201d and now, as a wave of cases threatens to swamp the hospital, \u201dI have no idea if there are any.\u201d\n\nAfter years of foreign intervention and neoliberal structural adjustment, Haiti has been forced into a desperate situation where it has little choice but to rely on international funds during periods of catastrophe.\n\nAs of 2013, 64 percent of Haiti\u2019s health budget was derived from international assistance, according to Dr. Georges Dubuche of the country\u2019s Ministry of Public Health and Population. The percentage has remained high.\n\nAs Dr. Carroll warns, \u201cHaiti does not have a functional health care system on a good day let alone a system that can effectively fight this virus.\u201d\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank has thus far committed $50 million to the Coronavirus response. The IMF is also apparently considering an unprecedented influx of reserve assets for developing countries.\n\nHaiti is one of 50 desperate countries that will have split between them some part of a recently launched $2 billion UN plan, but that will take time to materialize.\n\nUS-blockaded Cuba, whose medical teams have been heavily active in Haiti since 1998, has dispatched a brigade of 348 doctors and other health specialists to help fight the coronavirus.\n\nHaiti's government has steadily reduced national health spending in recent years.

It is apparently one of the first major medical institutions that has been proactively testing for Covid-19. A variety of NGOs and smaller health-oriented groups have scrambled to prepare and educate people about the pandemic.\n\nAt UniFA, the University of the Aristide Foundation, in a Port-au-Prince suburb called Tabarre, the medical school has just begun to graduate students who are required to practice inside the country. In March, the university graduated its first 138 students. Among its faculty have been teachers from Cuba.\n\nAs its website explains, the \u201cmedical school graduates are currently fulfilling their one-year government mandated social service residency in health care centers across the country. In many instances, these young professionals are the only health care providers for the entire community.\u201d\n\n#Haiti's health system is ill-prepared for COVID-19 outbreak due to corruption of current US-backed govt.

Funds for the elderly have been delayed or cut, further endangering those most at risk from the coronavirus.\n\nResponding to the calamity ahead\n\nWill the quarantine ordered by the Mo\u00efse government be ultimately seen as a hollow act of grand-standing? It is in large part not being enforced, and it\u2019s not clear if it even can be, given people\u2019s day-to-day struggle for survival.\n\nHaiti\u2019s government has put forward a preparation and response plan with an estimated $37.2 million budget, but it\u2019s unclear how effective it can be. Local and international organizations have been meeting to coordinate a response.\n\n#Haiti's govt has forsaken its responsibility to its people. This just yesterday in downtown Port au Prince.

Needing to earn money to feed up to eight family members, she exclaimed that she would rather be infected with the virus than not work, since her sole daily livelihood was now being taken away.\n\nMany are asking if Haiti\u2019s government will be able to secure basic food staples to feed the majority of the population, as large parts of the population live on just a few dollars a day or less and are now being pressured to isolate themselves and not work.\n\nThe Haitian government has announced food distribution measures for some districts, and this comes as the prices of some basic food staples has increased in recent months and the currency has rapidly depreciated.\n\nBy comparison, in the nearby Dominican Republic, state officials have announced on national television that the nation\u2019s poorest sectors will receive financial aid for food purchases through the government\u2019s \u201csolidarity debit cards.\u201d They will start receiving an increase of 5,000 Pesos (about US$92) monthly, starting on April 1 and running through the end of May. The Dominican Republic has become one of the largest locations for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Caribbean and is among the region\u2019s top tourist hotspots, so the government has many more resources to deal with such a crisis.\n\nThe first cases of Covid-19 in the Dominican Republic were officially acknowledged by its Health Ministry in late February. The Dominican government, meanwhile, has begun to take drastic measures such as a suspension of flights from Europe, a 5 PM to 6 AM curfew which may turn into a draconian 24-hour lockdown with exceptions for grocery shopping, buying prescriptions, and other necessary excursions.\n\nHaiti is the Dominican Republic\u2019s number two export market after the US, and is heavily dependent upon Dominican exports for basic food staples such as rice, as well as manufactured consumer items. Thus, anything that impacts the Dominican Republic eventually affects life in Haiti.\n\nA number of Haitian migrant workers appear to have fled back to the country to be with family. Others, whose economic survival depends on daily migrant labor, have no choice but to find illicit ways to cross back and forth across the border.\n\nA large part of the Haitian population is clearly aware of the real dangers posed by the coronavirus, but at the same time many confess they have no choice but to gain their daily livelihoods through the usual improvised and informal activities in the small scale economy. The overwhelming majority of these workers are forced to take very crowded public transportation to their workplaces.\n\nAs the virus hits countries worldwide, it is unlikely foreign governments will be able to marshal the Herculean support that Haiti needs. Haiti spends just $13 per capita on healthcare, compared to $180 by the Dominican Republic, and $781 in Cuba.\n\nConfusion reigns. Some Haitians have criticized recent moves by the government to push thousands of people to line up for national IDs, after officials declared the cards will be required to receive aid during the pandemic.\n\nDesperate times, desperate measures.

Mo\u00efse now governs without parliament after failing to hold elections, and had been facing a mass uprising threatening to chase him from office. Strong diplomatic support from the US has been the linchpin allowing his tenuous political survival.\n\nThe coronavirus though has put a pause on the giant anti-government protests that occurred throughout late 2019 and into early 2020. Yet these will undoubtedly return given how sharply the inhuman essence of neoliberal capitalism in Haiti and elsewhere has been exposed by the current crisis.\n\nAs massive protests against the US-backed Mo\u00efse rocked Haiti throughout 2019, and his government struck back by hiring violent paramilitaries to crack down, the Bernard Mevs Hospital went into debt treating hundreds of wounded demonstrators for free.\n\nThis March, while Covid-19 bore down on Haiti, the hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Jerry Bitar, was kidnapped.

Estimates of deaths from the January 12, 2010 earthquake range from 46,000 to 160,000 people, while many more were wounded and up to a million were displaced. The country has yet to recover from these tragedies, with many survivors still trapped tent cities.\n\nHaiti has also survived a cholera outbreak which killed close to 10,000 and sickened over 800,000. UN occupation troops were found to have caused the epidemic through their negligence, and a campaign demanding reparations from the UN continues.\n\nThe country has also suffered several devastating hurricanes, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which extensively ravaged Haiti\u2019s southern peninsula, wiping out crops and coastal towns.\n\nUS-imposed right-wing governments set the stage for another disaster\n\nHaiti\u2019s population faces the coronavirus pandemic after a series of man-made crises that set the backdrop for the coming crisis.\n\nFirst, there were the 1991 and 2004 coup d\u2019\u00e9tats, both US-backed schemes that sought to roll-back popular gains made after historic turnouts at the polls by Jean Bertrand Aristide\u2019s leftist Lavalas movement.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 elections, Washington intervened through the Organization of American States (OAS) to effectively change the electoral results and install the right-wing pop singer Michel \u201cSweet Micky\u201d Martelly, ushering in a decade of US puppet regimes.\n\nMartelly\u2019s successor, Mo\u00efse, appears to have pocketed millions of dollars stolen from funds meant to help build up the country through Venezuela\u2019s PetroCaribe program.

The government has closed Haiti\u2019s border, ports, and airports to the movement of people but kept supply chains open. Only a small number of tests have been administered, and there are rising fears that a health catastrophe will unfold over the coming weeks and months.\n\nNews and commentaries inside the country spread quickly over WhatsApp and local media. Under mounting stress, many know they are wholly unprepared for a pandemic that has also arrived in other Caribbean countries, including the neighboring Dominican Republic.\n\nThe latest reports indicate that there are 1380 cases in the Dominican Republic, with 60 deaths already. One of the country\u2019s main hospitals in the second largest city, Santiago de los Caballeros, reportedly no longer has beds available.\n\nMany families in Haiti have relatives residing in the Dominican Republic and receive updates regularly. The virus appears to have initially been brought to Haiti through Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. Since the first two cases, the official number rose to 15 by March 30, although that figure is surely an undercount. Dozens have been placed under quarantine.\n\nHaiti now faces a looming pandemic with an almost non-existent public healthcare system, and with a dysfunctional political system rooted in neocolonial intervention.\n\nThe Caribbean region has endured four centuries of slavery and colonialism and a fifth century of economic dependence. Accelerating globalization and technological developments have brought profound change to the region over the past 20 years, including no-cost digital communications, hi-tech remittance networks, low-cost mass travel and tourism, and new banking and financial arrangements. But it has also brought soaring inequality and climate shocks, mainly in the form of hurricanes and rising sea-levels.\n\nGlobalization and automation have caused billions of people to be cast into capitalism\u2019s surplus population. Under this system\u2019s relentless logic, vast portions of the world\u2019s people, even entire countries like Haiti, are condemned to rampant crime, unemployment, and inflation, alongside disintegrating infrastructure and government services. It sinks destructively into the social fabric of society.\n\nTo preserve social order and the neoliberal conception of \u201cgood governance,\u201d Western institutions resort to severe austerity measures and military intervention, further debilitating the neo-colony whose economic life-blood is being sucked out to enrich the transnational bourgeoisie.\n\nThis is the recipe that rendered Haiti completely unprepared for the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nStark Realities\n\nUnemployment in Haiti is already sky-high. With 6 million of Haiti\u2019s 11 million citizens living below the poverty line of $2.41 a day, according to the World Bank, most will face a grueling dilemma of how to feed themselves and their families while avoiding virus infection.\n\nDr. John A. Carroll, who has worked in clinics, hospitals, and orphanages in Haiti since 1995, explained, \u201cThere is no treatment in Haiti that will be accessible by the masses. But there is quarantine to stop transmission. But how do we isolate people in the Haitian slum where the population density is so high and people need to have human contact in order to survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe breadwinners in the house need to score some bread because they all need to eat,\u201d Carroll continued. \u201cAnd this family\u2019s neighbors next door don\u2019t have the time or abilities to help out because they have equally severe challenges surviving the slum also.\u201d\n\nWhile the Haitian government is officially promoting confinement and social distancing, the stark reality is that most of the population are likely heading toward collective \u201cherd immunity,\u201d where many must choose to get infected in the street rather than die by hunger at home. Some, like Carroll, think that this steep, as opposed to flattened, infection curve will result in fewer deaths.\n\nBuilding \u201cherd immunity\u201d is an approach that the U.K. government actually suggested for its own people weeks ago, but quickly rejected as a result of a fierce public backlash. Instead, the British state has imposed \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures and \u2014 despite a right-wing government being in office \u2014 committed to pay the majority of the payroll costs of businesses whose workers stay home.\n\nOn March 29, local medical experts interviewed on Radio Kiskeya, one of the country\u2019s most important radio stations, suggested that up to 800,000 Haitians could perish from the virus. Large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to avert such a catastrophe.\n\nThe Grayzone spoke with Dr. Ernst No\u00ebl, of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMP) in Port-au-Prince, who stated that the number of 800,000 is not an exaggeration. In his view, many people will likely die due to Coronavirus, and in larger numbers than those that perished in the 2010 earthquake.\n\nHe added that large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to soften the blow of the oncoming disaster.\n\nEdge of Meltdown\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Haiti\u2019s health-care system is ill-prepared for the looming catastrophe.\n\nAccording to Haiti\u2019s National Institute of Statistics, the country has only 911 doctors. A mere 4.4 percent of the national budget is allocated for national health, which translates to ill-equipped hospitals with woefully insufficient staff. State-run hospitals often face labor strikes, and some medical staff appear not to be showing up to work, as they are lacking masks, gloves and gowns and fear contracting the virus.\n\nAccording to Haiti\u2019s most read newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, the country has only 130 ICU beds, and most of these are older models.\n\nDr. Paul Farmer, a co-founder of the Boston-based health care organization Partners in Health, has suggested Haiti may actually have fewer than 30 fully functioning ICU beds.\n\nMeanwhile there are an estimated 64 ventilators inside the country, though some are likely not working.\n\nDr. Farmer has pointed out how people living in the Global South face significantly more risk due to underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure:\n\n\u201cAll these mechanics of a hospital, we [in affluent nations] don\u2019t have to deal with them. The oxygen is piped right into every room. But the dread of responsibility for my coworkers in Haiti is that they have to worry: Where do we get the oxygen, the IV solutions, can we space the beds for intensive or supportive care in a way that doesn\u2019t infect the caregivers? And we\u2019ve exhausted a lot of supplies as health-care workers are more attentive to putting on gloves, changing gloves, gowning up. We\u2019re seeing real supply chain challenges.\u201d\n\nDoctors assigned to the State University of Haiti (HUEH), the country\u2019s biggest medical facility, have reportedly barely escaped from a suspected Covid-19 outbreak. They had not received personal protection equipment, nor did they get the test kits prescribed for testing coronavirus patients. Even running water is lacking in some medical facilities.\n\n#Haiti has less than 130 ICU beds for a population of more than 10 million. A fast moving #Covid-19 and a crumbling medical infrastructure are recipes for disaster. #coronavirus pic.twitter.com\/RquC8yNHlb \u2014 Etant Dupain (@gaetantguevara) March 20, 2020\n\nDr. Ulysse Samuel serves at an external HUEH clinic receiving outpatients. He explained to The Grayzone that before the Covid-19 pandemic he had \u201cnever seen ventilators at the HUEH facility,\u201d and now, as a wave of cases threatens to swamp the hospital, \u201cI have no idea if there are any.\u201d\n\nAfter years of foreign intervention and neoliberal structural adjustment, Haiti has been forced into a desperate situation where it has little choice but to rely on international funds during periods of catastrophe.\n\nAs of 2013, 64 percent of Haiti\u2019s health budget was derived from international assistance, according to Dr. Georges Dubuche of the country\u2019s Ministry of Public Health and Population. The percentage has remained high.\n\nAs Dr. Carroll warns, \u201cHaiti does not have a functional health care system on a good day let alone a system that can effectively fight this virus.\u201d\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank has thus far committed $50 million to the Coronavirus response. The IMF is also apparently considering an unprecedented influx of reserve assets for developing countries.\n\nHaiti is one of 50 desperate countries that will have to split among them some part of a recently launched $2 billion UN plan, but that will take time to materialize.\n\nU.S.-blockaded Cuba, whose medical teams have been heavily active in Haiti since 1998, has dispatched a brigade of 348 doctors and other health specialists to help fight the coronavirus.\n\nHaiti's government has steadily reduced national health spending in recent years. In the last approved budget, more funds were allocated to parliament than toward the health sector. https:\/\/t.co\/pYrHrdhsUs pic.twitter.com\/nQwUS1VLop \u2014 Jake Johnston (@JakobJohnston) March 27, 2020\n\nSome important private and donor-backed medical clinics do exist, such as the Partners in Health-run hospital in Mirebalais. It is apparently one of the first major medical institutions that has been proactively testing for Covid-19. A variety of NGOs and smaller health-oriented groups have scrambled to prepare and educate people about the pandemic.\n\nAt UniFA, the University of the Aristide Foundation, in a Port-au-Prince suburb called Tabarre, the medical school has just begun to graduate students who are required to practice inside the country. In March, the university graduated its first 138 students. Among its faculty have been teachers from Cuba.\n\nAs its website explains, the \u201cmedical school graduates are currently fulfilling their one-year government mandated social service residency in health care centers across the country. In many instances, these young professionals are the only health care providers for the entire community.\u201d\n\n#Haiti's health system is ill-prepared for COVID-19 outbreak due to corruption of current US-backed govt.

A few factories may soon be overhauled to produce things like surgical masks. For common people seeking to take precautions, one surgical mask costs approximately 50 Gourdes (about 53 cents) but these are very hard to find.\n\nSome business groups active in Haiti are beginning to prepare, including an association of Chinese enterprises.\n\n2nd Shipment of the medical supplies (including 138000 masks) hv departed from China,donated by Association of Chinese Enterprises in Haiti. pic.twitter.com\/lUTjmzkBCI \u2014 ??(Chen Wen) (@ChenWen007) March 30, 2020\n\nTo compound the problem, under the corruption-stained Mo\u00efse government, the country\u2019s National Office of Old Age Insurance (OFNAC) has been grievously mismanaged. Funds for the elderly have been delayed or cut, further endangering those most at risk from the coronavirus.\n\nResponding to Calamity Ahead\n\nWill the quarantine ordered by the Mo\u00efse government be ultimately seen as a hollow act of grand-standing? It is in large part not being enforced, and it\u2019s not clear if it even can be, given people\u2019s day-to-day struggle for survival.\n\nHaiti\u2019s government has put forward a preparation and response plan with an estimated $37.2 million budget, but it\u2019s unclear how effective it can be. Local and international organizations have been meeting to coordinate a response.\n\n#Haiti's govt has forsaken its responsibility to its people. This just yesterday in downtown Port au Prince. Does this look like social distancing? If #COVID19 takes hold there is NO medical infrastructure to contain it. pic.twitter.com\/VKZaTEbp3h \u2014 HaitiInfoProj (@HaitiInfoProj) March 29, 2020\n\nOne street vendor woman (known as a \u201cTi Marchan\u201d) said in an interview with Haiti\u2019s Island TV that the present confinement is intolerable. Needing to earn money to feed up to eight family members, she exclaimed that she would rather be infected with the virus than not work, since her sole daily livelihood was now being taken away.\n\nMany are asking if Haiti\u2019s government will be able to secure basic food staples to feed the majority of the population, as large parts of the population live on just a few dollars a day or less and are now being pressured to isolate themselves and not work.\n\nThe Haitian government has announced food distribution measures for some districts, and this comes as the prices of some basic food staples has increased in recent months and the currency has rapidly depreciated.\n\nBy comparison, in the nearby Dominican Republic, state officials have announced on national television that the nation\u2019s poorest sectors will receive financial aid for food purchases through the government\u2019s \u201csolidarity debit cards.\u201d They will start receiving an increase of 5,000 Pesos (about $92) monthly, starting on April 1 and running through the end of May. The Dominican Republic has become one of the largest locations for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Caribbean and is among the region\u2019s top tourist hotspots, so the government has many more resources to deal with such a crisis.\n\nThe first cases of Covid-19 in the Dominican Republic were officially acknowledged by its Health Ministry in late February. The Dominican government, meanwhile, has begun to take drastic measures such as a suspension of flights from Europe, a 5 PM to 6 AM curfew which may turn into a draconian 24-hour lockdown with exceptions for grocery shopping, buying prescriptions, and other necessary excursions.\n\nHaiti is the Dominican Republic\u2019s No. 2 export market after the U.S., and is heavily dependent upon Dominican exports for basic food staples such as rice, as well as manufactured consumer items. Thus, anything that impacts the Dominican Republic eventually affects life in Haiti.\n\nA number of Haitian migrant workers appear to have fled back to the country to be with family. Others, whose economic survival depends on daily migrant labor, have no choice but to find illicit ways to cross back and forth across the border.\n\nA large part of the Haitian population is clearly aware of the real dangers posed by the coronavirus, but at the same time many confess they have no choice but to gain their daily livelihoods through the usual improvised and informal activities in the small-scale economy. The overwhelming majority of these workers are forced to take very crowded public transportation to their workplaces.\n\nAs the virus hits countries worldwide, it is unlikely foreign governments will be able to marshal the Herculean support that Haiti needs. Haiti spends just $13 per capita on healthcare, compared to $180 by the Dominican Republic, and $781 in Cuba.\n\nConfusion reigns. Some Haitians have criticized recent moves by the government to push thousands of people to line up for national IDs, after officials declared the cards will be required to receive aid during the pandemic.\n\nDesperate times, desperate measures. After #Haiti closed the border with the Dominican Republic, people crossed the river to buy and sell. In the era of neoliberal globalization, Haitians are forced to pick their poison: #coronavirus or mass starvation. pic.twitter.com\/lM0IxCJ5AP \u2014 Madame Boukman \u2013 Justice 4 Haiti ?? (@madanboukman) March 17, 2020\n\nMeanwhile a kidnapping wave has traumatized people in Haiti, even affecting the transportation sector bringing in goods from the Dominican Republic.\n\nProtest Movement Pauses\n\nThe situation is made more difficult by the ongoing political crisis. Mo\u00efse now governs without parliament after failing to hold elections, and had been facing a mass uprising threatening to chase him from office. Strong diplomatic support from the U.S. has been the linchpin allowing his tenuous political survival.\n\nThe coronavirus though has put a pause on the giant anti-government protests that occurred throughout late 2019 and into early 2020. Yet these will undoubtedly return given how sharply the inhuman essence of neoliberal capitalism in Haiti and elsewhere has been exposed by the current crisis.\n\nAs massive protests against the U.S.-backed Mo\u00efse rocked Haiti throughout 2019, and his government struck back by hiring violent paramilitaries to crack down, the Bernard Mevs Hospital went into debt treating hundreds of wounded demonstrators for free.\n\nThis March, while Covid-19 bore down on Haiti, the hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Jerry Bitar, was kidnapped. Hospital staff refused to take in new patients until Bitar was freed, leading to his release on March 27.\n\nHospital workers protest the kidnapping of Dr. Jerry Bitar who was kidnapped today while on the way to work. \"We will not continue to work without the release of Dr. Bitar.\" \"This is a hospital that accepts everyone, whether they can afford it or not.\" https:\/\/t.co\/6k0VIeyN1o pic.twitter.com\/5SNrdFRKon \u2014 Madame Boukman \u2013 Justice 4 Haiti ?? (@madanboukman) March 27, 2020\n\nIn the 21st century, Haitians have experienced one ordeal after another. Estimates of deaths from the Jan. 12, 2010 earthquake range from 46,000 to 160,000 people, while many more were wounded and up to a million were displaced. The country has yet to recover from these tragedies, with many survivors still trapped tent cities.\n\nHaiti has also survived a cholera outbreak which killed close to 10,000 and sickened over 800,000. UN occupation troops were found to have caused the epidemic through their negligence, and a campaign demanding reparations from the UN continues.\n\nThe country has also suffered several devastating hurricanes, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which extensively ravaged Haiti\u2019s southern peninsula, wiping out crops and coastal towns.\n\nUS-Imposed Governments Set Stage for Disaster\n\nHaiti\u2019s population faces the coronavirus pandemic after a series of man-made crises that set the backdrop for the coming crisis.\n\nFirst, there were the 1991 and 2004 coup d\u2019\u00e9tats, both U.S.-backed schemes that sought to roll-back popular gains made after historic turnouts at the polls by Jean Bertrand Aristide\u2019s leftist Lavalas movement.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 elections, Washington intervened through the Organization of American States (OAS) to effectively change the electoral results and install the right-wing pop singer Michel \u201cSweet Micky\u201d Martelly, ushering in a decade of U.S. puppet regimes.\n\nMartelly\u2019s successor, Mo\u00efse, appears to have pocketed millions of dollars stolen from funds meant to help build up the country through Venezuela\u2019s PetroCaribe program. Funds from PetroCaribe have been used by many Caribbean states to plug budget shortfalls and invest in important infrastructure.\n\nMo\u00efse is officially mentioned 69 times in the recent corruption report produced by the State Administrative Court and is considered one of the principal beneficiaries, both politically and financially, of the Petrocaribe funds corruption scheme.\n\nIn response to protests, the Haitian government and its allies have also turned to violent repression against popular neighborhoods where anti-government sentiments run high.\n\nUS-backed Haitian government agents accused of conducting massacre By @JebSpraguehttps:\/\/t.co\/mCCl3jCvKA \u2014 The Canary US (@TheCanaryUS) December 20, 2018\n\nInstead of investing in healthcare, the government has increasingly sought to strengthen its repressive capabilities.\n\nWith the support of planners at the Inter-American Defense Board, the Mo\u00efse government has begun rebuilding the military, which was disbanded in 1995.

The number has since increased to eight. In response, the president has declared a state of emergency and ordered schools, factories, and religious entities to close; established a curfew; and closed the country\u2019s borders. The government announced the new policies after previously suspending air travel from most countries.\n\nThe initial reported cases both related to individuals who had traveled internationally. There has, however, only been limited local testing. As of March 25, 58 tests had been administered nationwide, according to the latest epidemiological update. The Ministry of Health has outlined a plan to combat the pandemic in Haiti, estimating a budget of $37.2 million. Already, international and local organizations have been meeting to coordinate the response.\n\nAfter nearly two years of sustained protests and government inaction, the economic situation in Haiti has already made life exceedingly difficult for the vast majority of the population. The currency has rapidly depreciated, inflation has remained elevated, and the government has been unable to increase revenues domestically or through international assistance. The Haitian government has few fiscal resources to draw upon in responding to the coronavirus pandemic, and Haitian families, many already pushed to the edge, are facing an increasingly perilous future.\n\nThere are multiple complementary aspects of the response to this virus in Haiti. One centers on the health care system and the ability to adequately detect, treat, and contain the virus. The other relates to the government\u2019s ability to establish and enforce policies that encourage physical distancing. In addressing the latter, it is important to consider how the Haitian population interacts, lives, and survives in order to implement effective policies to contain the virus, protect the population, and ensure access to essential goods.\n\nThe cases reported have so far been marked as imported, but with the difficulties of enforcing a sustained national quarantine, Haiti is facing the very real risk of COVID-19 spreading locally. While declaring a state of emergency nationwide was a necessary step, it needs to be boosted by provisions for workers and the poor, and allocations for the health care system. The international community must also play a role, with the World Bank, IMF, and other multilateral development organizations immediately freeing up resources for Haiti and other developing nations to respond to the pandemic.\n\nThe Health Care System\n\nPrior to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, Haiti\u2019s health care system faced many challenges. According to a 2019 study by the Research and Education consortium for Acute Care in Haiti (REACH), Haiti only has an estimated 124 ICU beds and 64 ventilators for a population of more than 11 million. Other public health experts have put those figures even lower. This is a serious concern, especially given the relatively high proportion of the population considered to be at an elevated risk.\n\nAlready, there have been reports from the State University Hospital (HUEH) of inadequate preparation and supplies of protective equipment, which has led to some health professionals refusing to work. The HUEH was one of the marquee post-quake international reconstruction projects, but, more than ten years later, those plans remain mostly unrealized.\n\nHaiti\u2019s health care system overall is extremely reliant on private actors, including foreign assistance and NGOs. Dr. Youri Louistold the Haitian Times that, as of 2013, 64 percent of Haiti\u2019s health budget derived from international assistance. In many parts of the country, access to health care is only provided by nonstate actors.\n\nIn such a fragmented system, coordination will be critical. In this regard, it is positive that national and international organizations are already meeting and discussing coordinated response mechanisms. Health actors in Haiti can draw upon their experiences combatting the cholera epidemic, which spread in Haiti after its introduction by United Nations troops in 2010. While the response to cholera was woefully inadequate, more coordinated and concerted efforts in recent years have led to some positive developments. As Sandra Wisner of the Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti told the Haitian Times, empowering communities must be a key aspect of any successful response:\n\nThis includes access and ensuring services are available to communities \u2015 so having available where people are, tracing, treatment; health facilities resources with the necessary supplies, and ensuring front line workers have the resources and tools they need to provide safe and effective care and treatment for patients.\n\nSince the 2010 earthquake, the Haitian Ministry of Health has been one of the only government institutions that has received direct donor support. Nevertheless, a significant portion of foreign assistance bypasses national health systems. It is vitally important that efforts to respond to the current pandemic also focus on strengthening the government\u2019s health care infrastructure. Though some improvements have been evident over the previous decade, national health spending remains woefully inadequate and has actually decreased in recent years.\n\nThe government has also appealed to Cuba for assistance in fighting the pandemic. The government announced there were 348 Cuban health professionals in the country to respond, many of whom were already in the country as part of Cuba\u2019s decades-long assistance in providing health care in Haiti.\n\nThe Economy\n\nEven before the arrival of the novel coronavirus, the Haitian economy was projected to shrink by 1 percent on a per capita basis in 2019. The government\u2019s directive to close businesses will bring additional economic hardship. Remittances, on which the Haitian economy relies, may also see a reduction as diaspora communities struggle in their own communities with quarantines and business closures.\n\nHaitians\u2019 reliance on the informal economy will make responding to the crisis even more difficult. Some 60 percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day. Though the government has directed businesses to close, the reality is that many rely on the informal economy to survive.\n\nIn this regard, despite the government\u2019s announcements, public markets and public transportation continue to operate. Local journalists have raised concerns about the lack of guidelines for drivers and passengers. While the public might be aware of the virus, most people still depend on public transportation and public markets to survive and get around. Unions have taken the lead by recommending a reduction in the number of passengers allowed on taxis and buses, but there has yet to be any clear initiative from the state to enforce the unions\u2019 recommendations and regulate transportation.\n\nWhile the government has ordered factories closed, it is unclear what, if any, financial support from the government will go to impacted workers. Ant\u00e8n Ouvriye, an organization representing factory subcontractors, has criticized the government for not ensuring salaries will continue to be paid during closures. On March 25, de facto prime minister Joseph Jouthe announced that public workers and those working in the textile industry would receive one month of wages; however, it remains unclear exactly when that would take place and how much the government will be able to afford.\n\nIn order to ensure communities are able to take action to protect themselves and are able to stay at home, the government must act to provide the resources necessary to sustain people\u2019s livelihoods, including access to food and water. Some countries have acted to reinforce and increase government spending on essential services and social safety net policies. Some have prioritized subsidizing revenue by ensuring salaries are maintained, while others are providing meals to those who rely on daily activities for their basic needs. Although Haiti\u2019s resources are limited, the government response needs to incorporate economic relief for the population, especially for street vendors, factory workers, and small business owners, many of whom rely on the informal economy to make a living.\n\nThe government, however, has thus far relied on monetary policy \u2015 increasing access to credit through the central bank and relaxing repayment schedules. This, however, is likely to have only a limited impact for the vast majority of Haitians. Without greater international assistance, it is unlikely the government will have the fiscal resources available to properly support the population throughout the crisis.\n\nPrice gouging has already started, putting a strain on an already fragile population. This is partly due to the fact that the Haitian food supply depends largely on imports, which are likely to decline during the current situation. While the government has announced measures to ensure food distribution, it must make a priority of protecting consumers from price spikes. This also presents an opportunity to invest in and expand the agricultural sector, which could provide stability for farmers and sellers, and increase national production.\n\nInternational Aid\n\nIt is imperative to recognize that the Haitian state\u2019s inability to adequately respond to the crisis is tied to a legacy of foreign domination, occupation, and exploitation, and to decades of foreign aid policies that have eroded the state\u2019s capacity. Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear, as with the 2010 earthquake, that the Haitian government will not be able to adequately respond to the current crisis without increased support from the international community.\n\nThe IMF and the World Bank have issued a statement urging \u201call official bilateral creditors to suspend debt payments from IDA countries that request forbearance.\u201d Though most of Haiti\u2019s debt is concessional (loans provided at very low or even zero interest rates), bilateral and multilateral donors should immediately suspend any debt servicing requirements for the duration of the pandemic. The Inter-American Development Bank has also announced a special lending facility for countries impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe IMF could also provide an unprecedented influx of reserve assets to developing countries, including Haiti, through a Special Drawing Rights allocation. The IMF is reportedly considering this. With its dwindling reserves and reliance on the importation of goods, such a boost would be extremely valuable to Haiti.\n\nIt is also likely that a prolonged crisis will exacerbate an already fragile food security situation in much of the country. Many children rely on school feeding programs, which are often funded by international organizations. International assistance will be key in ensuring the government is able to reach the most vulnerable in responding to the pandemic, but international actors must be wary of repeating past mistakes. Food assistance should be designed to ensure local procurement of available goods, and to support investment in national production.\n\nThe onset of the coronavirus pandemic in Haiti requires immediate and concerted action by local and international actors; but in a country where the failures of international assistance and intervention are so readily apparent, those involved in the response must make every effort to ensure a more sustainable future.\n\nThis article first first appeared on CEPR.","tests":"['58 tests']","ventilators":"['64 ventilators']","beds":"['124 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

The government has closed Haiti\u2019s border, ports, and airports to the movement of people but kept supply chains open. Only a small number of tests have been administered, and there are rising fears that a health catastrophe will unfold over the coming weeks and months.\n\nNews and commentaries inside the country spread quickly over WhatsApp and local media. Under mounting stress, many know they are wholly unprepared for a pandemic that has also arrived in other Caribbean countries, including the neighboring Dominican Republic.\n\nThe latest reports indicate that 859 people have tested positive in the Dominican Republic, with 39 deaths already. One of the country\u2019s main hospitals in the second largest city, Santiago de los Caballeros, reportedly no longer has beds available.\n\nMany families in Haiti have relatives residing in the Dominican Republic and receive updates regularly. The virus appears to have initially been brought to Haiti through Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince. Since the first two cases, the official number rose to 15 by March 30, although that figure is surely an undercount. Dozens have been placed under quarantine.\n\nHaiti now faces a looming pandemic with an almost non-existent public healthcare system, and with a dysfunctional political system rooted in neocolonial intervention.\n\nThe Caribbean region has endured four centuries of slavery and colonialism and a fifth century of economic dependence. Accelerating globalization and technological developments have brought profound change to the region over the past 20 years, including no-cost digital communications, hi-tech remittance networks, low-cost mass travel and tourism, and new banking and financial arrangements. But it has also brought soaring inequality and climate shocks, mainly in the form of hurricanes and rising sea-levels.\n\nGlobalization and automation have caused billions of people to be cast into capitalism\u2019s surplus population. Under this system\u2019s relentless logic, vast portions of the world\u2019s people, even entire countries like Haiti, are condemned to rampant crime, unemployment, and inflation, alongside disintegrating infrastructure and government services. It sinks destructively into the social fabric of society.\n\nTo preserve social order and the neoliberal conception of \u201cgood governance,\u201d Western institutions resort to severe austerity measures and military intervention, further debilitating the neo-colony whose economic life-blood is being sucked out to enrich the transnational bourgeoisie.\n\nThis is the recipe that rendered Haiti completely unprepared for the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stark reality of Haiti\n\nUnemployment in Haiti is already sky-high. With 6 million of Haiti\u2019s 11 million citizens living below the poverty line of $2.41 a day, according to the World Bank, most will face a grueling dilemma of how to feed themselves and their families while avoiding virus infection.\n\nDr. John A. Carroll, who has worked in clinics, hospitals, and orphanages in Haiti since 1995, explained, \u201cThere is no treatment in Haiti that will be accessible by the masses. But there is quarantine to stop transmission. But how do we isolate people in the Haitian slum where the population density is so high and people need to have human contact in order to survive?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe breadwinners in the house need to score some bread because they all need to eat,\u201d Carroll continued. \u201cAnd this family\u2019s neighbors next door don\u2019t have the time or abilities to help out because they have equally severe challenges surviving the slum also.\u201c\n\nWhile the Haitian government is officially promoting confinement and social distancing, the stark reality is that most of the population are likely heading toward collective \u201cherd immunity,\u201d where many must choose to get infected in the street rather than die by hunger at home. Some, like Carroll, think that this steep, as opposed to flattened, infection curve will result in fewer deaths.\n\nBuilding \u201cherd immunity\u201d is an approach that the UK government actually suggested for its own people weeks ago, but quickly rejected as a result of a fierce public backlash. Instead, the British state has imposed \u201csocial distancing\u201d measures and \u2014 despite a right-wing government being in office \u2014 committed to pay the majority of the payroll costs of businesses whose workers stay home.\n\nOn March 29, local medical experts interviewed on Radio Kiskeya, one of the country\u2019s most important radio stations, suggested that up to 800,000 Haitians could perish from the virus. Large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to avert such a catastrophe.\n\nThe Grayzone spoke with Dr. Ernst No\u00ebl, of the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy (FMP) in Port-au-Prince, who stated that the number of 800,000 is not an exaggeration. In his view, many people will likely die due to Coronavirus, and in larger numbers than those that perished in the 2010 earthquake.\n\nHe added that large-scale foreign investment and monumental local efforts would need to be undertaken to soften the blow of the oncoming disaster.\n\nTeetering on the edge of a meltdown\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Haiti\u2019s health-care system is ill-prepared for the looming catastrophe.\n\nAccording to Haiti\u2019s National Institute of Statistics, the country has only 911 doctors. A mere 4.4 percent of the national budget is allocated for national health, which translates to ill-equipped hospitals with woefully insufficient staff. State-run hospitals often face labor strikes, and some medical staff appear not to be showing up to work, as they are lacking masks, gloves, and gowns and fear contracting the virus.\n\nAccording to Haiti\u2019s most read newspaper, Le Nouvelliste, the country has only 130 ICU beds, and most of these are older models.\n\nDr. Paul Farmer, a co-founder of the Boston-based health care organization Partners in Health, has suggested Haiti may actually have fewer than 30 fully functioning ICU beds.\n\nMeanwhile there are an estimated 64 ventilators inside the country, though some are likely not working.\n\nDr. Farmer has pointed out how people living in the Global South face significantly more risk due to underdeveloped healthcare infrastructure:\n\n\u201cAll these mechanics of a hospital, we [in affluent nations] don\u2019t have to deal with them. The oxygen is piped right into every room. But the dread of responsibility for my coworkers in Haiti is that they have to worry: Where do we get the oxygen, the IV solutions, can we space the beds for intensive or supportive care in a way that doesn\u2019t infect the caregivers? And we\u2019ve exhausted a lot of supplies as health-care workers are more attentive to putting on gloves, changing gloves, gowning up. We\u2019re seeing real supply chain challenges.\u201d\n\nDoctors assigned to the State University of Haiti (HUEH), the country\u2019s biggest medical facility, have reportedly barely escaped from a suspected Covid-19 outbreak. They had not received personal protection equipment, nor did they get the test kits prescribed for testing coronavirus patients. Even running water is lacking in some medical facilities.\n\n#Haiti has less than 130 ICU beds for a population of more than 10 million. A fast moving #Covid-19 and a crumbling medical infrastructure are recipes for disaster. #coronavirus pic.twitter.com\/RquC8yNHlb \u2014 Etant Dupain (@gaetantguevara) March 20, 2020\n\nDr. Ulysse Samuel serves at an external HUEH clinic receiving outpatients. He explained to The Grayzone that before the Covid-19 pandemic he had \u201cnever seen ventilators at the HUEH facility,\u201d and now, as a wave of cases threatens to swamp the hospital, \u201dI have no idea if there are any.\u201d\n\nAfter years of foreign intervention and neoliberal structural adjustment, Haiti has been forced into a desperate situation where it has little choice but to rely on international funds during periods of catastrophe.\n\nAs of 2013, 64 percent of Haiti\u2019s health budget was derived from international assistance, according to Dr. Georges Dubuche of the country\u2019s Ministry of Public Health and Population. The percentage has remained high.\n\nAs Dr. Carroll warns, \u201cHaiti does not have a functional health care system on a good day let alone a system that can effectively fight this virus.\u201d\n\nThe Inter-American Development Bank has thus far committed $50 million to the Coronavirus response. The IMF is also apparently considering an unprecedented influx of reserve assets for developing countries.\n\nHaiti is one of 50 desperate countries that will have split between them some part of a recently launched $2 billion UN plan, but that will take time to materialize.\n\nUS-blockaded Cuba, whose medical teams have been heavily active in Haiti since 1998, has dispatched a brigade of 348 doctors and other health specialists to help fight the coronavirus.\n\nHaiti's government has steadily reduced national health spending in recent years. In the last approved budget, more funds were allocated to parliament than toward the health sector. https:\/\/t.co\/pYrHrdhsUs pic.twitter.com\/nQwUS1VLop \u2014 Jake Johnston (@JakobJohnston) March 27, 2020\n\nSome important private and donor-backed medical clinics do exist, such as the Partners in Health-run hospital in Mirebalais. It is apparently one of the first major medical institutions that has been proactively testing for Covid-19. A variety of NGOs and smaller health-oriented groups have scrambled to prepare and educate people about the pandemic.\n\nAt UniFA, the University of the Aristide Foundation, in a Port-au-Prince suburb called Tabarre, the medical school has just begun to graduate students who are required to practice inside the country. In March, the university graduated its first 138 students. Among its faculty have been teachers from Cuba.\n\nAs its website explains, the \u201cmedical school graduates are currently fulfilling their one-year government mandated social service residency in health care centers across the country. In many instances, these young professionals are the only health care providers for the entire community.\u201d\n\n#Haiti's health system is ill-prepared for COVID-19 outbreak due to corruption of current US-backed govt.

Most were assembling clothes and electronics for export. A few factories may soon be overhauled to produce things like surgical masks. For common people seeking to take precautions, one surgical mask costs approximately 50 Gourdes (about $0.53) but these are very hard to find.\n\nSome business groups active in Haiti are beginning to prepare, including an association of Chinese enterprises.\n\n2nd Shipment of the medical supplies (including 138000 masks) hv departed from China,donated by Association of Chinese Enterprises in Haiti. pic.twitter.com\/lUTjmzkBCI \u2014 \u9673\u6587(Chen Wen) (@ChenWen007) March 30, 2020\n\nTo compound the problem, under the corruption-stained Mo\u00efse government, the country\u2019s National Office of Old Age Insurance (OFNAC) has been grievously mismanaged. Funds for the elderly have been delayed or cut, further endangering those most at risk from the coronavirus.\n\nResponding to the calamity ahead\n\nWill the quarantine ordered by the Mo\u00efse government be ultimately seen as a hollow act of grand-standing? It is in large part not being enforced, and it\u2019s not clear if it even can be, given people\u2019s day-to-day struggle for survival.\n\nHaiti\u2019s government has put forward a preparation and response plan with an estimated $37.2 million budget, but it\u2019s unclear how effective it can be. Local and international organizations have been meeting to coordinate a response.\n\n#Haiti's govt has forsaken its responsibility to its people. This just yesterday in downtown Port au Prince.

Needing to earn money to feed up to eight family members, she exclaimed that she would rather be infected with the virus than not work, since her sole daily livelihood was now being taken away.\n\nMany are asking if Haiti\u2019s government will be able to secure basic food staples to feed the majority of the population, as large parts of the population live on just a few dollars a day or less and are now being pressured to isolate themselves and not work.\n\nThe Haitian government has announced food distribution measures for some districts, and this comes as the prices of some basic food staples has increased in recent months and the currency has rapidly depreciated.\n\nBy comparison, in the nearby Dominican Republic, state officials have announced on national television that the nation\u2019s poorest sectors will receive financial aid for food purchases through the government\u2019s \u201csolidarity debit cards.\u201d They will start receiving an increase of 5,000 Pesos (about US$92) monthly, starting on April 1 and running through the end of May. The Dominican Republic has become one of the largest locations for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the Caribbean and is among the region\u2019s top tourist hotspots, so the government has many more resources to deal with such a crisis.\n\nThe first cases of Covid-19 in the Dominican Republic were officially acknowledged by its Health Ministry in late February. The Dominican government, meanwhile, has begun to take drastic measures such as a suspension of flights from Europe, a 5 PM to 6 AM curfew which may turn into a draconian 24-hour lockdown with exceptions for grocery shopping, buying prescriptions, and other necessary excursions.\n\nHaiti is the Dominican Republic\u2019s number two export market after the US, and is heavily dependent upon Dominican exports for basic food staples such as rice, as well as manufactured consumer items. Thus, anything that impacts the Dominican Republic eventually affects life in Haiti.\n\nA number of Haitian migrant workers appear to have fled back to the country to be with family. Others, whose economic survival depends on daily migrant labor, have no choice but to find illicit ways to cross back and forth across the border.\n\nA large part of the Haitian population is clearly aware of the real dangers posed by the coronavirus, but at the same time many confess they have no choice but to gain their daily livelihoods through the usual improvised and informal activities in the small scale economy. The overwhelming majority of these workers are forced to take very crowded public transportation to their workplaces.\n\nAs the virus hits countries worldwide, it is unlikely foreign governments will be able to marshal the Herculean support that Haiti needs. Haiti spends just $13 per capita on healthcare, compared to $180 by the Dominican Republic, and $781 in Cuba.\n\nConfusion reigns. Some Haitians have criticized recent moves by the government to push thousands of people to line up for national IDs, after officials declared the cards will be required to receive aid during the pandemic.\n\nDesperate times, desperate measures.

Mo\u00efse now governs without parliament after failing to hold elections, and had been facing a mass uprising threatening to chase him from office. Strong diplomatic support from the US has been the linchpin allowing his tenuous political survival.\n\nThe coronavirus though has put a pause on the giant anti-government protests that occurred throughout late 2019 and into early 2020. Yet these will undoubtedly return given how sharply the inhuman essence of neoliberal capitalism in Haiti and elsewhere has been exposed by the current crisis.\n\nAs massive protests against the US-backed Mo\u00efse rocked Haiti throughout 2019, and his government struck back by hiring violent paramilitaries to crack down, the Bernard Mevs Hospital went into debt treating hundreds of wounded demonstrators for free.\n\nThis March, while Covid-19 bore down on Haiti, the hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Jerry Bitar, was kidnapped. Hospital staff refused to take in new patients until Bitar was freed, leading to his release on March 27.\n\nHospital workers protest the kidnapping of Dr. Jerry Bitar who was kidnapped today while on the way to work. \"We will not continue to work without the release of Dr. Bitar.\" \"This is a hospital that accepts everyone, whether they can afford it or not.\" https:\/\/t.co\/6k0VIeyN1o pic.twitter.com\/5SNrdFRKon \u2014 Madame Boukman \u2013 Justice 4 Haiti \ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddf9 (@madanboukman) March 27, 2020\n\nIn the 21st century, Haitians have experienced one ordeal after another. Estimates of deaths from the January 12, 2010 earthquake range from 46,000 to 160,000 people, while many more were wounded and up to a million were displaced. The country has yet to recover from these tragedies, with many survivors still trapped tent cities.\n\nHaiti has also survived a cholera outbreak which killed close to 10,000 and sickened over 800,000. UN occupation troops were found to have caused the epidemic through their negligence, and a campaign demanding reparations from the UN continues.\n\nThe country has also suffered several devastating hurricanes, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016, which extensively ravaged Haiti\u2019s southern peninsula, wiping out crops and coastal towns.\n\nUS-imposed right-wing governments set the stage for another disaster\n\nHaiti\u2019s population faces the coronavirus pandemic after a series of man-made crises that set the backdrop for the coming crisis.\n\nFirst, there were the 1991 and 2004 coup d\u2019\u00e9tats, both US-backed schemes that sought to roll-back popular gains made after historic turnouts at the polls by Jean Bertrand Aristide\u2019s leftist Lavalas movement.\n\nIn the 2010-2011 elections, Washington intervened through the Organization of American States (OAS) to effectively change the electoral results and install the right-wing pop singer Michel \u201cSweet Micky\u201d Martelly, ushering in a decade of US puppet regimes.\n\nMartelly\u2019s successor, Mo\u00efse, appears to have pocketed millions of dollars stolen from funds meant to help build up the country through Venezuela\u2019s PetroCaribe program. Funds from PetroCaribe have been used by many Caribbean states to plug budget shortfalls and invest in important infrastructure.\n\nMo\u00efse is officially mentioned 69 times in the recent corruption report produced by the State Administrative Court and is considered one of the principal beneficiaries, both politically and financially, of the Petrocaribe funds corruption scheme.\n\nIn response to protests, the Haitian government and its allies have also turned to violent repression against popular neighborhoods where anti-government sentiments run high.\n\nUS-backed Haitian government agents accused of conducting massacre By @JebSpraguehttps:\/\/t.co\/mCCl3jCvKA \u2014 The Canary US (@TheCanaryUS) December 20, 2018\n\nInstead of investing in healthcare, the government has increasingly sought to strengthen its repressive capabilities.\n\nWith the support of planners at the Inter-American Defense Board, the Mo\u00efse government has begun rebuilding the military, which was disbanded in 1995. Historically, the Haitian military has symbolized repression of the popular will, presiding over numerous coups, massacres, and counter-insurgency campaigns to guarantee the Washington consensus.\n\nAs Jake Johnson of the Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) has written, \u201cThe Inter-American Defense Board, a body of the OAS, developed a \u2018white paper\u2019 in July [of 2015] focused on reinstating a Haitian defense force with the support of the UN.\u201d\n\nBy 2018, Haiti\u2019s new army had six personnel being trained at the US military\u2019s School of the Americas (SOA), which was renamed the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation (WHINSEC).\n\nIn March, the Haitian government disseminated a snappily produced public relations video on Whatsapp that portrayed soldiers distributing bags of rice to the doors of people\u2019s ramshackle homes.\n\nIn February 2020, however, the newly reconstituted military engaged in a deadly clash with police officers in Port-au-Prince who had been locked in a labor dispute with the government. The conflict illustrated the fundamental purpose of the country\u2019s military, which has always been loyal to the country\u2019s political right-wing, and whose existence was sustained for the purpose of internal repression.\n\nBattered by years of man-made and natural disasters, Haiti faces another historical ordeal with few resources to shoulder it. Sidelined and repressed by a US-imposed political apparatus, the poor majority will bear the brunt of the coronavirus.\n\nJeb Sprague is a Research Associate at the University of California, Riverside and previously taught at UVA and UCSB.

It also runs other healthcare facilities and works on the Haiti-Dominican border, where thousands of Haitians have crossed unchecked since both nations closed the border last month to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nCampa said Zanmi Lasante is aware that \u201cthe gold standard\u201d remains the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR test, which is more accurate but much slower and can take days to get results. Any positive cases found through the 15-minute rapid test will then be transferred over for PCR testing, she said.\n\nDoctors divided about benefits of rapid testing\n\nThe use of rapid testing in the battle to stop the spread of COVID-19 remains a divisive one among clinicians and public health specialists. During Monday\u2019s coronavirus briefing in Port-au-Prince, Dr. Patrick Dely, who is responsible for the ministry\u2019s epidemiology and laboratory section, addressed the rapid testing debate.\n\n\u201cEvery country adopts measures that goes with their reality; their means and the resources they have, \u201d Dely said. \u201cYour response cannot be based on what you see others are doing.\u201d\n\nDely said there are three types of tests that can be done to detect the coronavirus. But given the studies on both the rapid antibody and antigen tests, the country runs the risk of missing 40 percent of positive cases with a false negative result. Haiti, he said, has chosen to go the more accurate route of the polymerase chain reaction, which only its National Laboratory is currently entrusted to do. The lab he said, has the capacity to run about 800 tests a day.\n\nNot everyone agrees with this direction. Reginald Boulos, a Haitian businessman and physician with a master\u2019s in public health, said given the reality of the country and the ministry\u2019s own admission that Haiti now has community transmission, \u201cit\u2019s unrealistic to think that we can continue to do\u201d the PCR tests\n\nThe country, he said, needs to employ the South Korea model, where face masks in public are mandatory and the crisis is being managed by \u201ctesting, testing testing\u201d with a rapid antigen test. Unlike the antibody tests Zanmi Lasante plans to use to show the prevalence of the disease in communities, Boulos believes the antigen test provides more accuracy.\n\n\u201cWe need to change approach; coronavirus cannot be a clinical approach and this is what we\u2019re doing right now. We need a public health approach in Haiti; not just a clinician to have a nice laboratory being able to do 200 tests after three weeks. What does that say for a country with 10 million people?\u201d Boulos said. \u201cWe are not testing the country. We aren\u2019t really testing the people who we should be testing. People don\u2019t even know where to go and get tested.\u201d\n\nMore testing coming in Haiti\n\nBoulos said the Association of Automotive Importers recently donated $80,000 to expand testing in Haiti and increase the number of beds for COVID-19 patients. The donation went to GHESKIO, a research, treatment and training facility in Port-au-Prince, which had been seeking $200,000 for its COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cWe made one condition: to increase the 1,000 tests to 2,500 and [Dr. William Pape] has agreed to that,\u201d GHESKIO said.\n\nPape, the founder of GHESKIO, confirmed the donation, which he said will not go toward the purchase of rapid tests but the more accurate PCR tests.\n\nThe rapid test \u201cis a catastrophe,\u201d said Pape, who is a member of the scientific committee put in place by Haitian President Jovenel Mo\u00efse on the country\u2019s COVID-19 response.\n\n\u201cIf they were used we would hospitalize many patients who do not need to occupy unnecessary beds. At the same time, we would tell people who are infected that they are not and they would go around infecting others.\u201d Pape said. \u201cThe PCR test we are using is very accurate.\u201d\n\nA passenger in a tap-tap wears a mask to protect against the spread of the new coronavirus, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Monday, March 23, 2020. Dieu Nalio Chery AP\n\nPape said the ministry of health is right to follow the WHO\/PAHO recommendations to only test people documented by a trained epidemiologist to have signs and symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cThe nurse performing the test is highly exposed and must be properly protected, trained and certified. This is the best strategy when you have limited testing kits,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Ministry of Health, Pape said, has ordered more test kits but they are not available for sale outside the U.S. Kits approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been ordered from South Korea, but the real issue is that test kits are sold separately from extraction agents, which are essential to conduct the test. There is a global shortage of extraction agents.\n\nIn addition to the donation by the Haitian private sector, Pape said the dean of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York \u201chas graciously collected for us all extraction agents from their research labs\u201d as well as personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.\n\n\u201cThis should all arrive early this week to increase tremendously our capacity to perform tests in Haiti,\u201d he said. \u201cMany more testing sites are being set up.\u201d","tests":"['1,000 tests', '200 tests', '257 tests', '800 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Currently, the testing site is able to carry out a total of 400 tests per day \u2013 but eventually, it will be able to ramp it up all the way to 700. The facility, however, is reserved only for those who have already been referred by health officials for testing.\n\nBy using the drive-thru testing facility, potentially infected persons will avoid unnecessary contact with others \u2013 thus limiting the spread of the disease. After the results are in, those who have been discovered to actually be infected with the virus will immediately be sent into quarantine.\n\nPorto at the front lines\n\nThe city of Porto and its local government have been doing everything in their power to aid the nationwide efforts in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus. On Monday, Rui Moreira, the mayor of the city, announced that every business and venue that could close has been shut down.\n\nBy combining the now traditional and accepted approach of mass quarantines with innovative ideas, the city is certainly at the forefront when it comes to combating the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. Authorities are more than happy for Porto to serve as a trial run for the drive-thru testing site in the country and believe that if it proves successful, it could be implemented on a national scale.\n\nDrive-thru testing facilities have been operational for weeks in other parts of Europe and have proven to be more than effective and efficient. For example, in Helsinki, the drive-thru testing site has been of paramount importance for the city\u2019s efforts in halting the spread of the virus.\n\nLike the article?

Hundreds of people die in developed countries every day. The health system of no country can fully organize the treatment of an ever increasing number of patients. This should serve as a lesson for us. Therefore, the adoption of preventive measures in Azerbaijan and the implementation of these actions in accordance with the situation pursue one goal: to protect the life and health of our people and prevent the spread of the disease in Azerbaijan. All measures taken so far have produced the desired effect. Suffice it to say that 45,000 tests have been carried out in Azerbaijan to date. Currently, various Internet resources indicate the number of patients, the number of deaths, as well as the tests performed. Everyone can visit these sites and see,' said the head of state.\n\nHe noted that Azerbaijan is one of the leading countries in the world where so many tests have been performed.\n\n'This has helped us to identify the disease, provide patients with prompt medical assistance and protect ourselves from even greater troubles. So far we have succeeded. At the same time, the adoption of operational measures and the implementation of actions in accordance with the situation have produced effect. The new quarantine rules which entered into force on 5 April pursue one goal: to prevent the spread of the disease in Azerbaijan. This goal was also pursued by the decisions that were made prior to 5 April and the new rules. I have repeatedly said that we have demonstrated national unity, national accord, and we must also demonstrate responsibility. But in the current conditions, taking into account the rules that entered into force on 5 April, people should demonstrate discipline, because strict measures are envisaged in relation to those violating these rules. And these measures are already in place. I am sure that our citizens will fully comply with these rules, the disease will not be widespread and we will be able to overcome this situation with minimum losses,' said the head of state.\n\nPresident Ilham Aliyev noted that coronavirus patients undergo treatment in more than 20 hospitals today, including the most modern hospital, the 'Yeni klinika'.\n\n'This clinic was opened relatively recently, at the end of March, and is designed for 575 patients. If we take into account that the clinic was commissioned ahead of schedule, its capacity to receive patients will gradually increase \u2013100 patients at the initial stage, then 300 and then it will begin to operate at full capacity. Also, the hospitals I attended the opening of in the regions in early March of this year were also made available to the patients infected with coronavirus. The most modern hospitals located in the cities of Gazakh, Goranboy and Shamkir are treating patients with coronavirus. The number of beds in these three hospitals is around 500. So more than a thousand hospital beds meeting the most modern standards were put into operation in a matter of just one month, and patients infected with coronavirus are being treated there,' said the head of state.\n\nMENAFN0704202001870000ID1099982319","tests":"['45,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

This could be problematic during the coronavirus crisis. Here\u2019s an overview of the situation in Switzerland.\n\nBecause of Covid-19, healthcare facilities worldwide are under severe pressure. Many countries are struggling to stop the spread of the virus to prevent hospitals from being overloaded.\n\nSwitzerland has one of the highest numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases per capita. Hospitals therefore face a major challenge.\n\nFewer and fewer hospital beds in Switzerland\n\nGraph1 Chart\n\nAs the above chart shows, the number of hospital beds available per 100,000 inhabitants in acute care has fallen steadily in recent years. One reason is that the total number of this type of hospital bed is decreasing slightly every year. On the other hand, the constantly growing resident population in Switzerland plays a role. Even if the absolute number of beds remained the same, fewer and fewer beds would be available per resident.\n\nSwitzerland follows international downward trend\n\nGraph2 line chart\n\nSwitzerland is not alone in this downward trend. Hospital beds are being cut throughout Europe. Outside Europe, too, there are only a few exceptions in this trend of eliminating hospital beds. The most striking example is South Korea, which now has considerably more beds in acute care than it did ten years ago.\n\nSwitzerland and Greece have a similar number of hospital beds\n\nGraph3 chart\n\nLooking at the latest available figures for the OECD countries, Switzerland falls in the middle in terms of the number of hospital beds per capita \u2013 similar to Estonia, Greece or Luxembourg. Japan and South Korea have considerably more capacity; in these countries, more than twice as many beds per inhabitant are available in hospitals.\n\nNumber of beds in intensive care units: Switzerland only average\n\nMany questions currently revolve around the capacity of intensive care units. This data is more difficult to obtain and the figures probably vary greatly depending on the situation. Nevertheless, a group of scientists has taken the trouble to collect these figures for Europe in 2012. They are shown in the following graph.\n\nGraph4 chart\n\nIn 2012, the number of beds in intensive care units (ICUs) in Switzerland was slightly below the European average. The front-runner was Germany, with over 2.5 times as many beds per person as Switzerland. Portugal and Sweden came in last. Both have less than half as many intensive care beds as Switzerland.\n\nThe figures have certainly changed since 2012. However, they are roughly in line with the figures announced by individual governments at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis. The proportions are therefore likely to apply roughly to the period before the outbreak of the pandemic.\n\nHowever, many countries are in the process of upgrading their ICUs in the face of the coronavirus crisis. Switzerland is receiving support from the military. In addition, a Swiss manufacturer has supplied 900 ventilators.\n\n\n\nTranslated from German by Susan Misicka\n\nNeuer Inhalt Horizontal Line\n\nSWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram SWI swissinfo.ch on Instagram","tests":null,"ventilators":"['900 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

This has spread fear, suffering and needless death around much of the world. Due to the genuine and serious threat to public safety, governments are taking steps usually only witnessed in wartime to curb freedom of movement in an effort to halt the spread of the virus.\n\nThe British government, however, has been far too slow to take the threat to public health seriously. Richard Horton, the editor of respected medical journal The Lancet lamented on Wednesday that the government has wasted precious time in the fight against the virus. The \u201crapid and rigorous work\u201d of Chinese scientists in identifying the virus and writing about it in his journal \u201cwas an urgent warning to the world. We owe those scientists enormous thanks,\u201d Horton wrote in the Guardian.\n\n\u201cWhy did it take the UK government eight weeks to recognise the seriousness of what we now call Covid-19? \u2026 After weeks of inaction, the government announced a sudden U-turn on Monday, declaring that new modelling by scientists at Imperial College had convinced them to change their initial plans.\u201d\n\nHorton didn\u2019t pull his punches, but seems confident the tide can now be turned. Let us hope that he is correct and that the right lessons have been learned.\n\nMeanwhile, in occupied Palestine the Israelis are leveraging the pandemic to further increase their control of the already suffering Palestinians living under Israel\u2019s military dictatorship in the West Bank, and in the Gaza Strip under siege and occupation.\n\nREAD: Mossad delivers 100,000 coronavirus test kits to Israel overnight\n\nWhat\u2019s more, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth by Western liberals on Thursday, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu moved to tighten his grip on the state, sidelining calls for him to step down to make way for former general Benny Gantz. With Netanyahu\u2019s approval, Israel\u2019s secret police, the Shin Bet, imposed \u201cemergency\u201d measures to track people\u2019s movements via their mobile phone data.\n\nSuch all-pervasive violations of privacy have long been used against the Palestinian population by Israel\u2019s racism regime, with not a peep of objection from any Israelis apart from a minority of marginalised dissidents. Now, though, it seems that the \u201coppressive policies and practices developed and used in contexts of occupation, also end up being used by the occupying power against its own citizens,\u201d to quote the Palestinian digital rights group 7amleh.\n\nYuval Noah Harari, a relatively apolitical Israeli author, decided for once to tweet about the prime minister: \u201cThe first coronavirus dictatorship,\u201d is how he described Netanyahu\u2019s power play.\n\nThe first coronavirus dictatorship Netanyahu lost the elections. So under pretext of fighting corona, he has closed the Israeli parliament, ordered people to stay in their homes, and is issuing whatever emergency decrees he wishes. This is called a dictatorship. \u2014 Yuval Noah Harari (@harari_yuval) March 19, 2020\n\n\u201cNetanyahu lost the elections,\u201d claimed Harari, \u201cso under [the] pretext of fighting corona, he has closed the Israeli parliament, ordered people to stay in their homes, and is issuing whatever emergency decrees he wishes. This is called a dictatorship.\u201d\n\nHarari has a point, but was seemingly ignoring the military dictatorship that Israel has imposed on Palestinians without interruption since 1948. As is usual for most Israelis, he was treating the Palestinians as if \u2013 at best \u2013 they are invisible.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s son Yair, a well-established Twitter troll, shot back that Harari was a \u201clier [sic] and hater of your own country! He won!\u201d\n\nAnother bizarre Covid-19 story out of Israel this week was about the Mossad, its notorious spy agency and death squad. Mossad is most noted for murdering Palestinian leaders and using forged passports in doing so from countries such as the UK and Ireland with which it supposedly has friendly relations.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that Mossad has \u201cobtained\u201d 100,000 test kits for the new coronavirus from overseas. The initial report on this, from an Israeli news channel, \u201cappeared to leave ambiguous whether the agency had taken the test kits without permission.\u201d\n\nHaving taken them \u201cwithout permission\u201d seems like a very roundabout way of saying that, actually, Mossad agents stole them. Not to worry though. Our intrepid Jerusalem Post reporters \u201cconfirmed\u201d that the deadly Israeli spy agency had actually obtained its haul \u201cwith consent\u201d. Exactly how the Post claimed to have \u201cconfirmed\u201d this is not at all explained in their article, nor did it say whose \u201cconsent\u201d was given. It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that the independent \u201cconfirmation\u201d of this information consisted of a journalist asking the newspaper\u2019s Mossad sources, who swiftly proceeded to absolve themselves of any wrongdoing. Case closed.\n\nWhile there is a theoretical possibility that the test kits were bought legitimately, the involvement of a secretive, clandestine and brutal spy agency seems to suggest otherwise. However, another line in the paper\u2019s report hinted at another explanation. \u201cSome of the countries involved\u201d in selling the kits \u201cdo not have diplomatic relations with Israel.\u201d Who has very friendly links with Israel, but no formal diplomatic relations? Could the virus testing kits have been sold to Israel via Mossad by Saudi Arabia, the UAE or one of the other oppressive Gulf dictatorships? They are known to have serious under-the-table contacts with Israel, which have become fairly overt in recent years.\n\nREAD: More than 5,600 Israel soldiers quarantined over coronavirus fears\n\nIf that is the case, then the citizens of those countries will be asking why the test kits were sent to Israel and not used for their own wellbeing. Either that or Mossad is making the entire \u201cconsent\u201d story up and its agents really did steal them.\n\nFurthermore, the Jerusalem Post warned that, \u201cAdditional Mossad operations are expected soon, which could bring up to four million test kits to Israel.\u201d Let\u2019s hope for their sake that the spooks will be more successful next time. A postscript to this story reveals that Israel\u2019s most notorious spies managed to bungle yet another operation. It has emerged that Mossad\u2019s agents did not even take the right stuff, because the virus test kits were \u201cincomplete\u201d, claimed the Post. While the headline of the online version of the relevant article has been edited, an earlier version pointed out that the kits are, in fact, \u201cunusable\u201d. According to Haaretz, they are the wrong type altogether.\n\nNevertheless, the Jerusalem Post\u2019s warning about \u201cadditional Mossad operations\u201d has to be taken seriously. Such ineptitude is unlikely to be repeated.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.","tests":"['100,000 test kits']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Some hospitals still use the old models so the company keeps a supply of spare parts for them, he added.\n\nRudin Rosenzweig, 67, heads the Yokneam lab and is due to retire at the end of the month. For now, he still takes the 100-kilometer trip from his home in Rishon Lezion in Israel\u2019s center every day to repair the old ventilators. Some machines take a day to bring up to code, others take several days, it depends on the specific malfunctions, Rosenzweig told Calcalist.\n\nRelated coverage Israeli Citizen Indicted for Spying for Iran An Israeli citizen has been indicted for collaboration with Iranian intelligence agents and a terrorist operative in Lebanon, it was...\n\n\u201cThese devices have been sitting in storage for years, sometimes you need to fix an electronic card, sometimes replacing the batteries or oxygen sensors is in order,\u201d Rosenzweig said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we are talking about human lives, you do not play around with that.\u201d All of the lab\u2019s employees recognize the significance and nobody is staying home, they are all here, Rosenzweig said. \u201cWe already sent back 15 fully operational ventilators to hospitals and intend to deliver the rest by Passover eve,\u201d he said.\n\nMedtronic is also due to provide Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry with several hundred ventilators from its factory in Ireland by the end of the month. Up until a few months ago, the factory produced 250 machines a week. It has since more than doubled its production to meet global demand.\n\nLast week, Medtronic announced it has made the plans and schematics for one of its older ventilator models open source to let other companies around the world produce it. The released model has been in circulation since 2010 and can be used on coronavirus patients at the hospital or at home but is not intended for intensive care patients.\n\nDespite Medtronic\u2019s extraordinary announcement, it would take weeks or even months for other companies to produce the machines as they would need to secure a parts supply chain as well as regulatory approvals.\n\nThe manufacture of ventilators is now at an all-time high, but companies that get into it now, using Medtronic\u2019s schematics, could find themselves reaching the market long after the number of patients peeks and demand dwindles, which would see the market flooded with these machines for many years. Medtronic, however, as one of the world\u2019s largest medical device companies, will continue to produce and sell its other patent-protected devices, such as its proprietary insulin injectors.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['2,000 ventilators', '26 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}
{"country":"Israel","publish_date":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.jpost.com\/israel-news\/when-it-comes-to-coronavirus-could-israel-be-italy-622955","title":"Coronavirus: The truth about Israel's ventilators","text":"There are only 2,864 ventilators available in Israel, including those that belong to the Israel Defense Forces, for what are expected to be 5,000 critically ill coronavirus patients who require artificial respiration.\n\nMedical personnel are concerned that Israel could soon look like Italy or Spain, where the number of patients requiring respiration has significantly exceeded the number of machines available, and doctors are faced with the difficult choice of who to ventilate.\n\n\u201cAt some point we could have to avoid intubating and ventilating patients with a very poor prognosis,\u201d said Dr. Tal Brosh, head of the infectious disease unit at Samson Assuta Ashdod University Hospital and a member of the Health Ministry committee that evaluates the coronavirus threat in the country.\n\nHe gave the example of a 90-year-old with severe COVID-19 being admitted to the hospital alongside a 50-year-old patient. In the case of a ventilator deficit, the doctor would most likely choose to connect the younger patient, \u201cwho can be saved with that ventilator,\u201d as opposed to the older person, who will stay connected to the machine for two or three weeks but likely still pass away.\n\n\u201cNow, we don\u2019t have so many severe cases,\u201d Brosh stressed, but he said this ethical dilemma could be closer than we might think.\n\nAs of Monday morning, there were 74 patients in serious condition \u2013 more than double the number of critically ill patients just one week ago. Of those, 59 people are intubated. In total, 4,247 people have tested positive for the virus, and 16 people have died.\n\n\u201cVentilators are the most important thing in the fight against coronavirus,\u201d MK Ofer Shelah (Yesh Atid), chairman of the Knesset Coronavirus Committee, said in a meeting on Monday. He accused the Health Ministry of failing to take proper responsibility for the procurement of the machines in a fast enough and efficient way.\n\nThe country has ordered some 11,000 ventilators, but \u201cnot all of them will arrive on time\u201d to meet the needs of Israel\u2019s sickest patients, the Health Ministry\u2019s Dr. Orly Weinstein, who is responsible for the purchasing of such equipment, said Monday.\n\nSpecifically, she said Israel has ordered 11,000 ventilators, 7,400 monitors and 21,000 pumping systems. But many of those orders, which were only made on March 13, are on backorder and not expected to arrive soon.\n\nIt was revealed last week that the Health Ministry was aware as early as January 20 that the coronavirus was likely to penetrate Israel but took little action.\n\n\u201cThere is a belief that the systems will arrive at the same time as or after the people who need them,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cWe currently have 1,400 available machines in hospitals and another 400 that are being transferred to hospitals from external emergency medical centers and 70 from the private sector.\u201d\n\nThis number is added to the 800 to 900 units that Health Ministry director-general Moshe Bar Siman Tov said could be obtained from the army to reach the nearly 3,000 ventilators now available.\n\nFurthermore, Weinstein said 2,000 to 3,000 ventilators are slated to be produced in Israel within the next two months. One company delivered 27 on Sunday.\n\nAVI BUSKILA is president and CEO of Sarel, which has been hunting down the gear Israel needs to fight the coronavirus. Locally, one company has been producing about 60 units per month and in a few weeks is expected to produce as many as 600 a month, he said. His team has received referrals from private companies and is considering those purchases, but so far most of the suppliers cannot commit to exact delivery dates, he added.\n\nOn Monday, it was revealed that the Mossad brought a few dozen ventilators to Israel as well.\n\n\u201cI was a member of the Secret Service Subcommittee for six years,\u201d Shelah said. \u201cI know the institution\u2019s capabilities well, and we don\u2019t have the Mossad to deliver 30 ventilators.\u201d\n\nThe country has earmarked NIS 4.7 billion to fight the coronavirus; more than NIS 3b. of that is specifically to purchase ventilators and protective gear for medical staff. However, as Shelah said, it is unclear whether the country will be able to use the money to obtain needed equipment. Moreover, he said the Health Ministry\u2019s \u201cinept management\u201d could mean that when the ventilators do arrive, they will not be used properly.\n\n\u201cWe have found that the relevant parties in the Health Ministry\u2026 cannot even provide basic figures such as how many ventilators we are expected to have in one week, two weeks or a month,\u201d Shelah said at the committee meeting. \u201cCritical components, such as basic raw materials for domestic production, are lacking, and there is no real certainty as to when the machines will arrive. Even the 900 machines from the IDF\u2026 have not yet been allocated for the time when we will need them.\u201d\n\nTHERE IS an especially acute problem with ventilators in certain areas of the periphery and Jerusalem, MK Jaber Asakla (Joint List) said Monday.\n\n\u201cIn Nazareth, the situation is dire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is one children\u2019s hospital with only one ventilator and in other hospitals only a handful of others.\u201d\n\nThe Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya, which serves about 500,000 residents, has only 30 ventilators; Hadassah-University Medical Center in Jerusalem\u2019s Ein Kerem reported only 55; and the capital\u2019s Shaare Zedek Medical Center only 100, Ynet reported.\n\nIn the South, there are significant gaps between Ashkelon and Ashdod: Barzilai Medical Center, which serves some 140,000 residents of Ashkelon, Sderot and Gaza, has 114 ventilators; Assuta Ashdod Medical Center, which serves some 220,000 residents and several thousand people from the surrounding area, has only 56 ventilators. Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, which serves more than 200,000 residents and thousands of Bedouin, has 191 ventilators.\n\nThe hospital with the highest number of ventilators in Israel is Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer with 250 machines, according to Ynet.\n\nASSUTAH\u2019S BROSH told the Post he does not think the current trajectory puts Israel at risk for becoming Italy unless certain communities, such as the ultra-Orthodox sector, fail to practice social distancing.\n\n\u201cOur trouble is coming from these communities,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could spike very quickly.\u201d\n\nBut he also cautioned that the public should not see ventilators as the miracle and sole solution to the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just take a patient, connect him to a ventilator, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Brosh said. \u201cIf you take someone and just connect him to a ventilator, he will die.\u201d\n\nA person who is ventilated needs around-the-clock care and must be monitored by nursing and other professional staff to prevent ventilator-associated infections and lung damage, which the country currently lacks, he said. Coronavirus causes extensive damage to one\u2019s respiratory system, and most people, even those who will have a full recovery, will require weeks of care, he added.\n\nAs the country is working to procure more ventilators, Brosh said it is concurrently training more medical staff to treat ventilated patients.\n\nIsrael does not have enough beds in intensive-care units that can accommodate ventilated patients, and there is a concerted effort in all hospitals to increase capacity for coronavirus patients, he said.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['30 ventilators', '2,864 ventilators', '11,000 ventilators', '56 ventilators', '114 ventilators', '191 ventilators', '3,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

It Might Keep Aid Out Too","text":"Salam Khashan is acutely aware of the devastation a coronavirus outbreak would wreak on the Gaza Strip. Since the 25-mile long Palestinian territory confirmed its first two COVID-19 cases on March 22, the 29-year-old family doctor and her colleagues have been preparing for a large-scale outbreak of the highly infectious virus in one of the world\u2019s most densely populated and impoverished places.\n\nAt the Nasser medical complex in Khan Yunis where Khashan works, local positive cases would activate a new staff rotation system, with doctors working 14-day shifts, followed by 14 days in quarantine\u2014the virus\u2019s incubation period\u2014before being allowed to return home. New triage centers have been set up to receive ambulances and determine which patients need hospitalization. And a planned shift towards teleconsultations will soon allow Khashan to conduct some appointments remotely.\n\nBut in a territory where mains electricity is often available for less than half the day, and where there are fewer than 100 ventilators to serve a population of around 2 million people, Khashan acknowledges that no amount of preparation will be sufficient. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough hospitals, or ICU beds, or mechanical ventilators. I understand those facts,\u201d she tells TIME by phone on March 31. \u201cIf we have a positive case in the community, it will be a disaster.\u201d\n\nGaza\u2019s health system \u201cis already overstretched, already at its limit,\u201d says Ignacio Casares, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) sub-delegation to Gaza. \u201cIt is unable to absorb the impact of an aggressive pandemic like COVID-19.\u201d The \u201ccritical shortage of test kits, ventilators, drugs, and medical consumables,\u201d heap pressure on Gaza\u2019s densely packed population, he says, with those in refugee camps (run by UNRWA, the main U.N. agency providing aid to Palestinian refugees) especially at risk from COVID-19. In Israel, which pulled out of Gaza in 2005 but retains responsibilities for the 140-square mile enclave under international law, senior security officials have warned that a local coronavirus outbreak would constitute a \u201cgod-help-us\u201d scenario.\n\nDespite the dire projections, that scenario is yet to arrive. As of April 3, Gaza had recorded only 12 COVID-19 infections: far fewer than Israel, which has in excess of 6,800 cases, or the 750-plus cases in neighboring Egypt, whose authorities have been accused of grossly underestimating infection rates.\n\nExperts say such underreporting is unlikely in Gaza. The dozen Gazans diagnosed with COVID-19 were all either recent returnees from abroad already in isolation when they were diagnosed, or members of security forces staying with those returnees at quarantine centers.\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to entirely rule out undetected infections in the wider community, rigorous contact tracing means \u201cthe number of positive cases we are seeing right now might give us the right picture,\u201d says Gerald Rockenschaub, Head of the World Health Organization\u2019s office for the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nSuch a low case rate is a function of Gaza\u2019s isolation. In 2007, after the militant group Hamas violently expelled the Palestinian Authority from the Strip, Israel and Egypt imposed an air, land, and sea blockade that for almost 13 years has restricted the movement of people and goods in and out of the territory.\n\nIsrael says the restrictions it places on an exhaustive list of \u201cdual-use\u201d items\u2014whose contents range from chemical fertilizers, to aluminum poles, to steel cables, to water skis\u2014are necessary for maintaining security against a hostile military group that frequently launches missile barrages across its borders. But critics of the policy\u2014which has at times restricted goods as quotidian as cilantro\u2014insist it has transformed Gaza into \u201cthe world\u2019s largest open-air prison.\u201d\n\nFor now, an instrument the U.N.\u2019s Human Rights Council says is being used for \u201ccollective punishment\u201d is Gaza\u2019s principal bulwark against the coronavirus. The irony is not lost on Khashan. \u201cFor the first time in our lives, the blockade gives us an advantage,\u201d she says. Still, the poverty it has exacerbated makes it difficult for her to convince patients to stay at home: \u201cIf people do that, maybe they can escape the coronavirus, but they can\u2019t escape the lack of supplies or the lack of food.\u201d\n\nPalestinian artists draw a mural during awareness campaign about the coronavirus COVID-19, in Gaza on April 2,2020. Majdi Fathi\u2013NurPhoto\/ Getty Images\n\nIsrael\u2019s leadership and the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers the occupied West Bank, both moved rapidly to contain the novel coronavirus, which as of April 3 had killed 37 people in Israel and one person in the West Bank.\n\nIsrael\u2019s embattled Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the first world leaders to implement mandatory quarantining for all arrivals. And after the discovery of COVID-19 cases in the West Bank city of Bethlehem, the PA also moved quickly to impose a lockdown. Israel and the PA established a joint command center to manage the crisis, and the U.N.\u2019s Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process has praised Israel\u2019s and the Ramallah-based Palestinian leadership\u2019s cooperation as \u201cexcellent.\u201d Hamas\u2019s relationship to Israel, however, appeared to remain business as usual. Despite the pandemic inducing a lull in violence, Gaza-based militants in March fired rockets into Israel, prompting retaliation from the Israel Defense Force.\n\nYet no amount of preparation could prevent the pandemic from battering Israel economically. Around a quarter of Israelis are now out of work, up from about 5% at the end of 2019, Joshua Krasna, a former Israeli diplomat tells TIME. Polling by the Jerusalem-based Israel Democracy Institute suggests that two-thirds of Israelis are now worried about their economic future, with Arab-Israelis\u2014who constitute a disproportionate number of those in poverty\u2014the most concerned.\n\nWhile no such surveys exist in Gaza, economic anxiety is widespread. Even before the pandemic, about half of Gaza\u2019s population was living in poverty, including some 400,000 children. When rare protests against Hamas erupted last year, demonstrators held aloft placards bearing slogans such as \u201crevolt of the hungry.\u201d and Gaza\u2019s weekly March of the Return demonstrations along Israel\u2019s border\u2014at which Palestinians demanded the right to return to their ancestors\u2019 homes\u2014have also highlighted the strip\u2019s dire economic conditions.\n\nThose conditions have contributed to a healthcare system woefully underprepared for a pandemic. In addition to the paucity of ventilators and other medical equipment, Gaza has only around 120 ICU beds, says ICRC\u2019s Casares\u2014and most are already occupied by non-COVID-19 patients. \u201cWe are asking the UN and the international community to give us immediate support, including ventilators and intensive care equipment to deal with the epidemic,\u201d Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Ashraf al-Qudra told a press briefing on March 24.\n\nIn the past, much of the funding supplied to the UN agency that supports the Palestinians came from the U.S. But those funds have dried up under President Trump\u2019s White House. Cutting financing to UNRWA is only one of several long-held U.S. positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict Trump has reversed. In January, he released his son-in-law and special advisor Jared Kushner\u2019s long-delayed \u201cMiddle East Peace Plan,\u201d which greenlights Israel\u2019s annexation of swathes of West Bank territory.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Congress last year allocated $75 million in humanitarian assistance for Palestinians in 2020, the White House has not allowed that aid to be delivered, despite the pandemic. On March 27, a group of Democratic Senators wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that providing coronavirus relief to Gaza and the West Bank would not only be in the interest of the Palestinian people but also \u201cin the national security interest of the United States\u201d as well as that of \u201cour ally Israel.\u201d\n\nBut Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells TIME there is little chance of the Trump administration reversing course on aid to the Palestinians, despite the prospect of high numbers of COVID-19 related deaths.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019ve spoken to administration officials, they\u2019ve argued that the Palestinians are responsible for their own conditions and the opportunities are there for the Palestinians to ameliorate their own conditions,\u201d by cooperating politically with Israel and Washington, he says. \u201cI have continuously heard Israeli and U.S. officials reject responsibly for Palestinian suffering and put the blame on the Palestinian leadership,\u201d adds Alterman, a former State Department official.\n\nThe WHO\u2019s Rockenschaub tells TIME that \u201cwe see very positive cooperation from the Israeli side\u201d in terms of facilitating the entry of essential supplies into Gaza. But as recently as February, the WHO had officially accused Israel of obstructing Palestinians\u2019 access to vital medicine. On April 1, Israel\u2019s hawkish Defense Minister Naftali Bennet linked future support for Gaza\u2019s coronavirus mitigation efforts to the recovery of two Israeli soldiers lost during the 2014 war, Reuters reports.\n\nUnless she\u2019s asked directly, Dr. Khashan does not tell her patients about the dire lack of ICU beds, ventilators, personal protective equipment, and medication in Gaza.\n\nIn consultations, the family doctor advises her patients to focus on \u201cthings we can control, like washing of hands, not touching your face, and social distancing.\u201d In houses where water and electricity are erratic, shared by up to 13 relatives, such advice can be difficult to implement. But \u201cyou have to do what you can,\u201d Khashan tells her patients. \u201cYou have to deal with what you have.\u201d\n\nBraced for a coronavirus outbreak in a system ill-equipped to contain it, it\u2019s also a principle with which she also abides. \u201cI have many choices. One of them is to worry and to cry,\u201d Khashan says. \u2018At the same time, I have the choice to stand up and work and do my best. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Kimberly Dozier \/ Washington D.C.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.

Ambassador Christoph Heusgen, diplomats said.\n\nThe draft resolution, which diplomats said has support from the 10 non-permanent council members, stresses the importance of \u201curgent international action to curb the impact of COVID-19.\u201d It underscores \u201cthat combating this pandemic requires greater international cooperation and solidarity, and a coordinated, comprehensive and global international response under the leadership of the United Nations.\u201d\n\nThe Security Council has twice previously addressed public health emergencies, first the HIV\/AIDS pandemic and second the swiftly spreading Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 which it called a threat to international peace and security.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly is expected to decide by Thursday evening whether to adopt either, both, or neither of two rival resolutions on COVID-19. One resolution, which has more than 135 co-sponsors, supports the World Health Organization and calls for \u201cintensified international cooperation\" to defeat the pandemic. The other, sponsored by Russia with support from four countries, also recognizes WHO's leading role, but it says unilateral sanctions must not be applied without U.N. Security Council approval.\n\n___\n\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico usually welcomes migrants living in the United States back with open arms, in part because the money they send home supports the economy. But the Mexican government is now urging them not to come home due to the risk of spreading the new coronavirus.\n\nThe Foreign Relations Department said in a statement Wednesday that permanent residents abroad, especially those in the United States, should \u201cavoid all types of international travel, including to Mexico.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cwe urge all those Mexicans with permanent residence in the United States who want to reunite with their families, to temporarily suspend all non-essential trips to our country.\u201d The department also urged Mexicans to avoid travel to the United States.\n\nMexico currently has 1,378 confirmed coronavirus cases, with 37 deaths. The United States has over 215,000 cases and over 5,100 deaths.\n\n___\n\nMONTREAL \u2014 Quebec's premier says almost a quarter of Quebec seniors' homes have at least one COVID 19 case.\n\nPremier Francois Legault says 519 of the Canadian province's roughly 2200 seniors homes and long-term care facilities have reported cases. He is urging Quebecers to refrain from visiting elderly people who are highly susceptible to the virus. He calls it a matter of life and death.\n\nLegault says the government is offering to pay for hotels for workers who want to limit their contacts outside of work.\n\n___\n\nSingapore has had its fourth death from COVID-19 as the country crosses 1,000 cases.\n\nThe patient, a 68-year-old Indonesian man, died of complications from the disease and had a history of diabetes and hypertension.\n\nSingapore has seen an increase in the number of imported cases and community transmission of COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING \u2014 China's southern technology powerhouse of Shenzhen has issued the most sweeping ban yet on the breeding and consumption of wild animals in an effort to prevent a future outbreak such as the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe virus, first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December, has been traced to a food market in the city that sold wild animals such as pangolins and civet cats, along as more conventional fare such as chicken and fish.\n\nThe consumption of wild animals is considered even more popular in the south where Shenzhen is located. That is where the 2002-2003 global SARS outbreak was believed to have first been spread by people who consumed or worked with wild animals in areas around Shenzhen and who may originally have caught it from wild bats.\n\nShenzhen's regulations permanently ban the trade in and consumption of wild animals, a step beyond the temporary ban issued by the central government at the start of the current virus outbreak. Along with snakes, lizards and other wild animals, it also bans the consumption of dog and cat meat that have long been a local specialty, citing humanitarian reasons.\n\nHouseholds pets have not been found to spread the coronavirus.\n\nThe ban allows for fines beginning at 150,000 yuan ($21,400) and rising considerably depending on the value of the animals seized. It continues to permit the farming of wild animals for medicinal purposes, which has been criticized as cruel and unsanitary, although consumption of such animals for food is banned.\n\n___\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 The Philippine president has threatened to order law enforcers to shoot troublemakers and stop a massive food and cash aid if people resort to riots and defy a lockdown imposed on millions to fight the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised speech Wednesday night that he also would ask the police to punish people who attack doctors and health workers with toxic chemicals by dousing the offenders with the potentially lethal substance or force them to drink it. Troublemakers will starve in jails, he warned.\n\nDuterte, who has been condemned for his brutal anti-drugs crackdown that has left thousands of mostly poor suspects dead, issued the warnings hours after police broke up a rally by slum dwellers pleading for food aid and arrested 21 of them in suburban Quezon city.\n\n\u201cMy orders are for the police, the military and the villages, in case there\u2019s trouble and there\u2019s an occasion where they fight and your life is threatened, shoot them dead,\u201d Duterte said, adding that the viral outbreak \u201cis getting worse.\u201d\n\nAmid delays and widespread complaints in the distribution of promised cash and food packs, Duterte said he was transferring that responsibility from politicians to a department led by an ex-general and warned he would be harsh to those who would steal the aid.\n\nThe Philippines has reported 2,311 cases of the COVID-19 illness, including 96 deaths, and expects infections to soar after more test kits arrived and laboratories were opened.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The State Department says a planeload of medical supplies sent from Russia to the United States on Wednesday was purchased under an agreement between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDepartment spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement that the supplies, including ventilators and personal protective equipment, were not a gift.\n\n\u201cBoth countries have provided humanitarian assistance to each other in times of crisis in the past and will no doubt do so again in the future,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a time to work together to overcome a common enemy that threatens the lives of all of us.\u201d\n\nOrtagus did not say how much the U.S. paid for the supplies, which were handed over to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in New York after the Russian cargo plane carrying them landed at John F. Kennedy international airport. She said the U.S. would continue to assist other countries in dealing with coronavirus pandemic \u201cbut we cannot do it alone.\u201d\n\nEarlier Wednesday, Russia\u2019s ambassador to Washington said the delivery reflected the need to pool global efforts to counter the COVID-19 virus despite political differences. Ambassador Anatoly Antonov rejected claims that Russia was seeking political gain by providing the supplies as \u201ccynical and immoral,\u201d adding that Russian military medical experts there were risking their lives on daily basis.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said arrangements had been made with the Canadian and British governments to evacuate many of the passengers on two cruise ships set to soon dock in Florida.\n\nTrump added that officials in states overwhelmed by coronavirus infections are reluctant to have the passengers immediately return to their communities.\n\n\u201cIt's a tough situation you know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can understand you have people that are sick on the ships and states don't want to take (them). They have enough problems right now. They don't want to take them. But we have to from a humane standpoint. We don't have a choice. I don't want to do that but we have to. People are dying.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is acknowledging that the federal stockpile is nearly depleted of personal protective equipment used by doctors and nurses to protect themselves from the new coronavirus.\n\n\"It is,\u201d Trump told reporters at a press briefing Wednesday, \u201cbecause we're sending it directly to hospitals.\u201d\n\nConcerns about the stockpile levels were first reported by the Washington Post on Wednesday.\n\nTrump has said that the stockpile has almost 10,000 ventilators but that the administration has been keeping close hold on them so they can be deployed quickly to states that need them. But he said the administration had agreed to ship out 1,000 ventilators.\n\nHe says, \u201cwe have to have the flexibility of moving the ventilators to where the virus is going.\u201d\n\n____\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump says he is \u201cthinking about\u201d enacting new restrictions on domestic flights as coronavirus cases continue to spike across the country.\n\nTrump told reporters at a White House briefing Wednesday that \u201cwe're certainly looking at it.\"\n\nHe says, \u201cwe\u2019re getting into a position now where we want to do that, we have to do that ... and we may have some recommendations.\u201d\n\nFlights continue across the U.S., including between coronavirus hotspots such as New York and Detroit, though the number of passengers had plummeted.\n\nTrump says he\u2019s worried, however, about the impact on already-struggling airlines, saying that, once you do that, \u201cyou really are clamping down\u201d on \u201can industry that is desperately needed.\u201d\n\nAlso, Trump says his administration is \u201clooking very seriously\u201d at building two additional Navy hospital ships of the kind that have been deployed to New York and Los Angeles to help ease the burden on local hospitals.\n\nTrump says the idea is to either build two \u201cbrand new\u201d hospital ships or convert an existing large ship to serve as a floating hospital. He offered no timeline or estimated cost.\n\nBuilding two new ships likely would take many months, if not years, suggesting Trump could be aiming to expand this capacity for future health crises.\n\nThe USNS Mercy in Los Angeles and the USNS Comfort in New York are each equipped with about 1,000 beds and large medical staffs. Their mission is to handle trauma cases, rather than COVID-19 patients.\n\n___\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 The United Nations says the global economy could shrink by almost 1 percent this year because of the coronavirus pandemic instead of growing at a projected 2.5 percent.\n\nA new report from the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs on Wednesday warned that world output could contract even further from this year\u2019s 0.9 percent forecast if restrictions on economic activities extend to the third quarter of the year, and if fiscal responses fail to support income and consumer spending.\n\nThe report said the negative effects of current economic restrictions in richer developed nations will soon spill over into developing countries which will see lower trade and investment.\n\nThe severity of the economic impact \u2014 whether a moderate or deep recession \u2014 will largely depend on the duration of restrictions on the movement of people and economic activities in major economies, and the size and impact of fiscal responses, it said.\n\nU.N. Undersecretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Liu Zhenmin said: \u201cUrgent and bold policy measures are needed, not only to contain the pandemic and save lives, but also to protect the most vulnerable in our societies from economic ruin and to sustain economic growth and financial stability.\u201d\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 New York City is enlisting its recently retired police commissioner as a coronavirus supply czar to ensure hospitals on the front lines of the fight have sufficient equipment.\n\nJames O\u2019Neill, who left the New York Police Department in November, is taking the role on a voluntary basis and will remain a senior vice president and global security chief at credit card giant Visa Inc.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said O\u2019Neill will develop a system of checks to ensure supplies such as protective masks, gowns and gloves and vital pieces of equipment such as ventilators are where they need to be. New York City accounts for most of the state's COVID-19 deaths, which doubled in 72 hours to more than 1,900.\n\nO\u2019Neill was with the police department for 36 years, the last three as commissioner. In that role, he led a move away from controversial policies, guided its response to terrorist attacks and oversaw continuing drops in crime.\n\n___\n\nATHENS, Greece \u2014 The Orthodox Church of Greece says this month\u2019s Easter Week and Easter Sunday services will be held behind closed doors, with only a few priests allowed in and no members of the general public, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOrthodox Easter is the most popular date on Greece\u2019s religious calendar, with large crowds flocking to Easter Week -- which falls this year on April 12-19 -- services daily, attending candle-lit mourning processions on Easter Friday and often rowdy celebrations for the Resurrection at midnight on Easter Saturday.\n\nThe Church of Greece on Wednesday urged the faithful to pray at home, in an act of \"sacrifice.\" The government has already warned Greeks that traditional Easter Sunday festivities, that include open-air family feasts with mass roasting of lambs, will not be allowed this year.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 U.S. military officials say they are sending another 540 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to help the Department of Homeland Security bolster efforts to keep COVID-19-infected migrants from crossing the border.\n\nGen. Terrance O'Shaughnessy, commander of U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for the defense of the United States, told reporters Wednesday that the extra troops would help \u201cseal off\u201d the flow of coronavirus. Mexico has far fewer reported cases of the virus than does the U.S.\n\nLt. Gen. Laura Richardson, who commands land forces under O'Shaughnessy, says the extra troops will be deployed \u201cvery soon.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. already has about 2,700 active-duty troops and about 2,500 members of the National Guard on the border.\n\n___\n\nJACKSON, Miss. \u2014 Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced Wednesday that he is ordering people statewide to stay at home to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nThe order will take effect at 5 p.m. Friday and last until 8 a.m. April 20. The Republican governor said: \"This will not be easy for anyone, but we believe it is the right course of action.\u201d\n\nReeves was not the only Southern governor to reverse course Wednesday. Two of his Republican counterparts who had repeatedly resisted statewide stay-home orders \u2014 Ron DeSantis of Florida and Brian Kemp of Georgia \u2014 also issued the mandate.\n\nMississippi has surpassed 1,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and has more than 20 deaths, according to numbers released Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak issued a statewide directive telling Nevadans to stay at home, with an exception for essential trips.\n\nThe Democratic governor had already asked Nevada residents two weeks ago to stay home and ordered a closure of casinos and non-essential businesses, but on Wednesday he decided to formalize his request that Nevadans stay home with a written order.\n\nUnlike the orders issued by some other governors, Sisolak\u2019s directive does not include a penalty for those who violate it.\n\nThe governor\u2019s order doesn\u2019t apply to the homeless or people making essential trips such as to get groceries, receive health care or receive goods or services from businesses that have been allowed to stay open, such as pharmacies, hardware stores and restaurants that offer take-out only.\n\n___\n\nAll Pennsylvania residents must stay home as much as possible to help slow the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Tom Wolf said Wednesday as he dramatically expanded the footprint of the quarantine to include the entire state.\n\nThe Democratic governor added 34 counties to his existing stay-at-home order, meaning that residents of all 67 of Pennsylvania\u2019s counties are now asked to stay put unless they have a legitimate reason to go out.\n\nThe expanded order will take effect at 8 p.m. Wednesday and last through at least April 30.\n\n___\n\nLONDON \u2014 The United Nations\u2019 international climate summit is being postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe British government says the meeting, due to take place in Glasgow in November, will now be held in 2021. The date has yet to be decided.\n\nThe government said in a statement that \u201cin light of the ongoing, worldwide effects of COVID-19, holding an ambitious, inclusive COP26 in November 2020 is no longer possible.\u201d\n\nGlasgow\u2019s SEC Arena, which had been due to hold the event, has been named as the site of a temporary hospital for COVID-19 patients.\n\n___\n\nGORDONSVILLE, Va. \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence says Americans will have enough food and supplies to get through the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPence said America\u2019s food supply is \u201cvery strong\u201d on Wednesday as he toured a Virginia distribution center for Walmart, the world\u2019s largest retailer.\n\nShelves at grocery and other stores across the U.S. were picked clean of toilet paper and other essentials at the onset of the pandemic.\n\nPence toured a chilly warehouse for perishable goods ranging from potatoes to bananas. He had removed his suit jacket and sported a Walmart associate\u2019s badge that said \u201cMike.\u201d\n\nThe vice president told a Walmart truck driver that he and all drivers are considered \u201ccritical infrastructure.\u201d\n\nPence used the intercom to tell all employees they\u2019re on the \u201cfront lines\u201d of the pandemic. He thanked them for doing a \u201cgreat job\u201d and for \u201ckeeping food on the table for the American people.\u201d\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence says the White House\u2019s models for the coronavirus outbreak show the country on a trajectory akin to hard-hit Italy.\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Pence says, \u201cWe think Italy may be the most comparable area to the United States at this point.\"\n\nPence was referencing the prediction models unveiled by the White House on Tuesday that project 100,000 to 240,000 U.S. deaths in the coronavirus pandemic. Those figures assume that the country maintains rigorous social-distancing practices for the duration of the public health crisis.\n\nItaly\u2019s health system was stretched beyond capacity weeks ago leading to soaring death tolls. U.S. governors and local officials have warned their states need urgent federal help to avoid a similar fate.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https:\/\/apnews.com\/VirusOutbreak and https:\/\/apnews.com\/UnderstandingtheOutbreak","tests":null,"ventilators":"['1,000 ventilators', '10,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Hong Kong has seen a rise in the number of imported cases in the city, and its confirmed cases has more than doubled in the last two weeks.\n\nOn Sunday, Hong Kong\u2019s airport saw only 813 arrivals, a drop of close to 82% compared to before the restrictions were put in place on March 24.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s entry restrictions exempt certain groups, including aircraft crew, government officials on duty, spouses and minor children of Hong Kong residents as well as personnel engaged by the government in anti-epidemic work.\n\n___\n\nUNITED NATIONS \u2014 More than 160 current and former global leaders and other VIPs are urging the world\u2019s 20 major industrialized nations to approve $8 billion in emergency global health funding to hasten the search for a vaccine, cure and treatment for COVID-19 and prevent a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn an open letter to governments of the Group of 20 nations released Monday night, the leaders, ministers, top executives and scientists also called for $35 billion to support countries with weaker health systems and especially vulnerable populations, and at least $150 billion for developing countries to fight the medical and economic crisis.\n\nThey also urged the international community to waive this year\u2019s debt repayments from poorer countries, including $44 billion due from Africa,\n\nWhile the communique from the G20 leaders\u2019 summit on March 26 recognized the gravity and urgency of the health and economic crisis sparked by the pandemic, the letter said \u201cwe now require urgent specific measures that can be agreed on with speed and at scale.\u201d\n\nThe group called for a global pledging conference, coordinated by a G20 task force, to commit resources to meet the emergency needs to tackle COVID-19.\n\nThe 165 signatories included former U.N. secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, 92 former presidents and prime ministers, the current prime ministers of Ethiopia and Bangladesh, Sierra Leone\u2019s president, philanthropist George Soros, former Irish president Mary Robinson who chairs The Elders, and Graca Machel, the group\u2019s deputy chair.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean officials are considering using electronic wristbands to monitor the growing number of people placed under self-quarantine to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nHealth Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho on Tuesday said such devices were one of several measures discussed by officials as they search for \u201cpractical and effective ways\u201d to monitor people isolated at homes and facilities.\n\nYoon acknowledged that wristbands would come with privacy concerns and didn\u2019t offer a specific answer when asked how likely it was that the government would enforce their use.\n\nThe number of people placed under quarantine has ballooned since last week when South Korea began enforcing 14-day quarantines on all passengers arriving from overseas to stem a rise in imported infections.\n\nLee Byeong-cheol, an official from the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, said more than 46,500 people were under self-quarantine as of Monday evening, including 38,400 who have recently arrived from abroad. He said the number could eventually reach 80,000 or 90,000.\n\nWhile quarantined individuals are required to download an app that alerts authorities if they leave their homes or facilities, Yoon said apps aren\u2019t enough when people are slipping out by leaving their smartphones behind or switching off location functions.\n\nLee said South Korean police are currently investigating more than 70 people over allegations of breaking quarantine.\n\n___\n\nMANILA, Philippines \u2014 The Philippine president has extended by half a month to April 30 a lockdown that requires millions of people in the country\u2019s main northern region to stay home amid the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte said Monday in a late-night TV speech that the government was desperately looking for more funds for a massive cash and food aid intended to prevent the poor from starving to death. There have been appeals for middle-class families to be given emergency aid too, he said.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing to eat, a human being can be violent especially if he sees his children without food and he\u2019s driven to tears,\u201d Duterte said, adding he has ordered the finance secretary to \u201csteal, borrow, I don\u2019t care,\u201d just to produce more emergency funds.\n\nThe government has targeted 18 million low-income families for economic rescue under the lockdown with a 275-billion-peso ($5 billion) budget in the next two months. Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya told foreign correspondents Monday 16.3 billion pesos ($320 million) have been distributed so far.\n\nDuterte demanded that the aid be given more rapidly amid complaints of delays and confusion over who should get it.\n\nThe Philippines has reported 3,660 cases of COVID-19 disease, including 163 deaths.\n\n___\n\nSEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korea has reported 47 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, bringing its totals to 10,331 infections and 192 fatalities.\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday said at least 802 of the infections were linked to passengers arriving from abroad amid broadening outbreaks in Europe and the United States. Most of these cases have been detected in the past three weeks, inflating the caseload in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea\u2019s 51 million people live.\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun during a meeting on anti-virus strategies on Tuesday repeated his public pleas for social distancing and lamented that young people were lining up at clubs and other leisure facilities at risk of becoming \u201cquiet spreaders\u201d of the virus.\n\nWhile South Korea\u2019s government has shut schools and issued social-distancing guidelines for the public, it has not enforced lockdowns or ordered unessential businesses to close.\n\n___\n\nBEIJING. \u2014 China on Tuesday reported no new deaths from the coronarivus over the past 24 hours and just 32 new cases, all from people who returned from overseas.\n\nAnother 12 suspected cases \u2014 also all imported \u2014 were being kept under observation, along with an additional 30 asymptomatic cases. China now has 1,242 confirmed cases in treatment and 1,033 asymptomatic cases under isolation and monitoring.\n\nThe country that gave rise to the global pandemic has recorded 3,331 deaths and 81,740 total cases. Numbers of daily new deaths have been hovering in the single digits for weeks, hitting just one on several occasions.\n\n___\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will brief the U.N. Security Council for the first time on the coronavirus pandemic on Thursday, behind closed doors.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019s most powerful body has come under criticism for not addressing the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 disease. The council has in the past spoken out on two public health emergencies \u2014 HIV\/AIDS and Ebola.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly unanimously approved a resolution on April 2 recognizing \u201cthe unprecedented effects\u201d of the coronavirus pandemic and calling for \u201cintensified international cooperation to contain, mitigate and defeat\u201d the COVID-19 disease. Resolutions of the 193-member world body reflect global opinion but are not legally binding.\n\nDiplomats say the Security Council, whose resolutions are legally binding, is divided between its 10 members who are elected for two-year terms and some of its five permanent members \u2014 the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia and China.\n\nThe elected members have been pressing for a council briefing by Guterres and have circulated a draft resolution on the pandemic. France is drafting a rival text.\n\nDiplomats said the permanent members wanted a summit of their leaders before a council meeting, and were trying to arrange one as late as Monday morning, but that meeting failed to materialize.\n\nThe Dominican Republic holds the Security Council presidency this month and its spokesperson informed the media late Monday of Thursday\u2019s closed meeting to hear from the secretary-general.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO \u2014 Manufacturing giant 3M says it has an agreement with the Trump administration that will allow the company to continue to send N95 protective masks to Canada and Latin America.\n\n3M says the company has a plan to produce 166.5 million masks over the next three months to support healthcare workers in the U.S.\n\nPresident Trump had used his authority under the 1950 Defense Production Act to stop exporting such masks, also known as respirators. The move to block such masks, which are crucial in protecting healthcare workers on both sides of the border from the virus that causes COVID-19, outraged many officials in Canada.\n\n3M issued a statement last week saying that could have \u201csignificant humanitarian implications\u201d for healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America. The company had said possible retaliation by other nations could actually lead to fewer of the masks being available in the U.S.\n\n___\n\nIn New York City, nearly 1 in 5 police officers were out sick Monday, many with flu-like symptoms.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said the NYPD has a \u201cvery deep bench\u201d with about 36,000 officers and won\u2019t need to bring in reinforcements from other agencies, and police officials say there is no imminent need to move to 12-hour shifts.\n\nIn all, more than 2,220 people working for the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus. One detective and a dozen civilian employees have died from the disease.\n\n___\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he was saddened to hear British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was taken into intensive care as he battles the new coronavirus.\n\n\u201cAmericans are all praying for his recovery,\u201d Trump said during a White House press briefing. \u201cHe\u2019s been a really good friend. He\u2019s been really something very special, strong, resolute, doesn\u2019t quit, doesn\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\nTrump said he asked two \u201cleading companies\u201d to contact officials in London about therapeutics that could be of help.\n\nHe did not specifically identify the companies, but said \u201cwe have contacted all of Boris\u2019s doctors and we\u2019ll see what\u2019s going to take place but they are ready to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you get brought into intensive care, that gets very, very serious with this particular disease.\u201d Trump said.\n\n___\n\nThe USNS Comfort is now being used for COVID-19 patients.\n\nPresident Trump confirmed that he\u2019d called New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier Monday to let him know that the USNS Comfort can now be used for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to let him do it,\u201d said Trump, adding that the ship will will be used for patients from both New York and New Jersey.\n\n\u201cHopefully that will be very helpful for both states,\u201d he said.\n\nCuomo had tweeted shortly before Trump\u2019s news conference began that the ship would add 1,000 beds staffed by federal personnel.\n\n\u201cThis will provide much-needed relief to our over stressed hospital systems,\u201d he wrote.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump is touting the end of a dispute with 3M to supply millions of masks to medical professionals on the front lines of the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nTrump said that the \u201c3M saga ends very happily. We\u2019re very proud to be dealing now with 3M.\u201d\n\nThe president said that the company agreed to deliver an additional \u201c55.5 million high-quality facemasks each month.\u201d\n\nTrump had invoked the Korean War-era Defense Production Act to prevent 3M from exporting masks abroad.\n\nIt had sparked some fears that other nations would down on the shipment of medical supplies to the US.\n\n___\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been moved to the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his coronavirus symptoms worsened.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office says Johnson is conscious and does not require ventilation at the moment.\n\nJohnson was admitted to St. Thomas\u2019 Hospital late Sunday, 10 days after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nJohnson has asked Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to deputize for him.\n\n___\n\nPARIS \u2014 France\u2019s health minister has reported the country\u2019s highest 24-hour death toll recorded in the country since the COVID-19 pandemic began.\n\nOlivier Veran said Monday evening that 833 people died of coronavirus in hospitals and nursing homes since Sunday.\n\nThough some predicted that the infection rate might start to slow, Veran said that \u201cwe have not reached the end of the ascent of this epidemic.\u201d\n\nFrance has only recently started counting nursing home deaths in their COVID-19-related death counts, and previously only reported deaths in hospitals.\n\nThe total number that have died from the coronavirus stands at 8,911.\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK \u2014 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended stay-at-home restrictions through the end of the month, citing fresh evidence Monday that the outbreak-fighting rules could be helping the state avoid a worst-case catastrophe.\n\nNew York state has tallied 4,758 deaths from COVID-19, with 599 reported in the past 24 hours. It remains the most impacted state with more than 130,000 laboratory-confirmed cases and close to 17,000 people hospitalized.\n\nBut the number of new people entering hospitals daily has dropped, as have the number of critically ill patients requiring ventilators. Recent data suggests the state could be at or near the peak of the outbreak, state officials said.\n\nWarning it was no time the relent, Cuomo said schools and nonessential businesses will remain closed until April 29.\n\nCuomo stressed that even if New York has reached the peak, numbers could persist at these levels, which would continue to stress struggling hospitals.\n\n___\n\nNEW JERSEY \u2014 New Jersey\u2019s death toll from the coronavirus surpassed 1,000 people, according to data released Monday from the state\u2019s health department.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, New Jersey fatalities from COVID-19 climbed from 917 to 1,003.\n\nNew Jersey and New York are among the hardest-hit states in the country. New Jersey is likely weeks away from hitting the peak of the outbreak, according to health officials.\n\nBergen, Essex and Hudson counties in suburban New York have seen the most cases.\n\n___\n\nBATON ROUGE, Louisiana \u2014 Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards says his state is starting to see hospital admission and death rates that could suggest new infections are slowing.\n\n\u201cWe are starting to real signs that these mitigation measures that we put into place weeks ago are starting to bear real results, and we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re seeing the beginning of the flattening of the curve,\u201d the Democratic governor said at his daily press briefing, offering a hint of optimism in a state with one of the nation\u2019s highest per capita virus infection rates.\n\nThe New Orleans region isn\u2019t expected to run out of ventilators or hospital beds within days, as previously projected.\n\nEdwards cautioned that even if data continues to show that Louisiana has truly turned a corner in battling the outbreak, no one should celebrate by having an Easter crawfish boil or more trips outside of the house.\n\n\u201cThe fear is that I\u2019m telling people that and they\u2019re going to say, \u2018Oh, the task at hand is accomplished. We can go back to doing whatever it is we normally do,\u2019\u201d Edwards said. \u201cThat is exactly the wrong answer.\u201d\n\nLouisiana has nearly 15,000 people with confirmed infections. The state\u2019s death toll is at least 512.\n\n___\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s governor has added criminal penalties to his orders demanding people stay home unless going to work or the grocery store to fight the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nGov. Henry McMaster said people can call it a \u201cstay-at-home\u201d order if they like. South Carolina had been the final state east of the Mississippi to not have that specific order.\n\nSouth Carolina has closed almost all stores that don\u2019t sell medicine, food, home improvement supplies, liquor or guns and banned gathering of three or more people. Anyone violating the governor\u2019s social distancing orders can be ticketed for a misdemeanor and face a $100 fine or 30 days in jail.\n\nMcMaster also says he has not been tested for COVID-19. The governor says he has followed protocol that says only test people with symptoms.\n\nAt 72, McMaster is the oldest governor in South Carolina\u2019s 350-year history as an English colony and state.\n\n___\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Monday that because of the coronavirus outbreak schools will remain physically closed for the remainder of the school year and that the state\u2019s more than 1.2 million public and private K-12 students will continue distance learning until the end of June.\n\nWashington state had the first major COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.\n\nSchools have been shut statewide since March 17 and were originally scheduled to reopen April 27.\n\nNow, that closure is extended until midnight June 19 \u2014 when the spring term ends \u2014 and schools are encouraged to continue to provide distance learning. The order also asks schools to start planning for a potential expansion of the order into the summer and fall.\n\nUnder the order, some in-person and on-site services such as meetings with seniors to help finish up final projects and tutoring support is allowed only if social distancing and proper hygiene practices are followed.\n\nLast week, Inslee extended orders to keep non-essential businesses closed and most of the state\u2019s residents home through May 4, saying that social distancing measures must remain in place an additional month in order to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nRICHMOND, Va. \u2014 Eight more residents of a Virginia long-term care facility who tested positive for coronavirus have died, bringing the death toll amid the outbreak to 28, the facility\u2019s administrator said Monday.\n\nDeaths at the Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in Henrico County have continued to mount since health officials tested every resident last week because of the scope of the outbreak. That testing showed roughly two-thirds of the residents had the virus.\n\nThirty-four residents were experiencing symptoms ranging from moderate to mild, and 54 of the residents who tested positive were showing no sign of being ill, the statement said.\n\nAcross Virginia, the Virginia Department of Health reported nearly 2,900 confirmed cases and 54 deaths Monday, figures that state health commissioner Dr. Norman Oliver said at a news conference were \u201calmost definitely an underestimate\u201d because of a lack of widespread testing.\n\n___\n\nIllinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker began his daily briefing with a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s poor assessment of his performance.\n\nThe Democratic governor again went over what the state had received from the national stockpile and what the state had procured on its own.\n\nAs an example, he noted that the federal government had supplied 368,000 N95 masks and 693,000 gloves, while the state had procured 10 million N95 masks and 19 million gloves.\n\nAt the same time, Pritzker said the state\u2019s \u201c10-day burn rate for PPE\u201d is 1.5 million N95 masks and 25 million gloves.\n\n\u201cTo anyone who wants a response to some of the blame-shifting coming out of the White House, all I have to say is, look at the numbers,\u201d Pritzker said.\n\n___\n\nATLANTA \u2014 Motorists lined up in rows of cars at a mass drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in Atlanta.\n\nThe state of Georgia is partnering with CVS Health in launching rapid testing Monday at a parking deck on Georgia Tech\u2019s midtown Atlanta campus. Gov. Brian Kemp announced the plan recently. Georgia has recorded more than 200 virus-linked deaths and more than 1,300 hospitalizations.\n\nTotal infections statewide exceed 7,000 and Fulton County, which is home to Atlanta, leads the state with nearly 1,000 cases.\n\nExperts say they hope more testing will give a better sense of how widespread the coronavirus is in Georgia.\n\n\u201cRoll your window up, roll your window up!\u201d a police officer yelled at drivers as they approached the first of at least two checkpoints. Dozens of drivers pressed their photo IDs and cellphones against their car windows to show their appointment confirmations. Cars were then directed to another area where testing was being done.\n\n___\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. \u2014 A West Virginia judge in the county with the state\u2019s highest coronavirus caseload has approved strapping ankle monitors to people who test positive but refuse to quarantine. The Monday order allows Kanawha County sheriffs to use the GPS bracelets if someone with the virus ignores an isolation order.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear how many people violated the mandates, though one local official put the number at \u201ca few.\u201d Officials say at least 345 people statewide have the virus with four reported deaths.\n\nKanawha County, where the state capital of Charleston is located, has the most positive cases in the state with 56.\n\n___\n\nROME \u2014 Italy\u2019s day-to-day increase in new COVID-19 cases has dipped again.\n\nThe nearly 3,600 new cases that authorities announced on Monday were the lowest day-to-day increase in 20 days. Another number boosting hopes in Italy\u2019s medical community was a small drop, for the third straight day, in the number of intensive care beds occupied by patients with coronavirus infections nationwide.\n\n\u201cSubstantially, the data confirms the trend\u201d of a slowing of new cases and \u201cgives comfort that the measures of containment against the viral infection are effective,\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Luca Richeldi, a pneumologist with Rome\u2019s Gemelli Hospital.\n\nItaly now has at least 132,547 confirmed cases, putting it just behind Spain in total known cases. There were 636 deaths in Italy since Sunday, up from 525 a day earlier. But Richeldi said that overall, a downward trend in deaths was holding, showing a decrease of 20 percent compared to a week earlier.\n\nOn Monday, Italy marks a month under national lockdown aimed at slowing contagion with the virus.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https:\/\/apnews.com\/VirusOutbreak and https:\/\/apnews.com\/UnderstandingtheOutbreak","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['368,000 N95 masks']"}

Their objective is straightforward: To build a low-cost ventilator, a machine that mechanically assists a patient in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide by a process of artificial respiration.\n\nOne of the initiatives is the brainchild of two alumni of the Lebanese University\u2019s Faculty of Engineering, Hisham Issa and Hussein Hamdan, both engineers currently working abroad. Together with Dr. Hussein Al-Hajj Hassan, 30, they launched a Facebook drive to create an artificial ventilator entitled \u201cA Breather for All Lebanon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe might not be capable of serving everyone in hospitals, but there\u2019s a possibility of manufacturing the machine here,\u201d Hassan, who holds a Ph.D. in engineering from IMT Atlantique in France, told Arab News.\n\n\u201cSo we conducted a study on the expertise we needed, whose results I posted on my Facebook page. The post went viral and people started calling me.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo ensure its suitability for use by hospitals, the ventilator will be fabricated as per the specifications contained in a nine-page document issued by the UK\u2019s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to meet the MHRA specifications,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cWe\u2019re working in an incremental way, setting milestones and going forward toward each of them.\u201d\n\nAccording to the three engineers, although their ventilator is now in an advanced stage of development, they are struggling with the lack of availability of key components in Lebanon.\n\n\u201cIf you want a perfect medical device, you need medical equipment, which isn\u2019t available here, so we\u2019re trying to find alternatives,\u201d said Hassan.\n\nOnce the team has fabricated a successful prototype, ramping up production to meet the shortage of ventilators should not be a problem, he added. \u201cWhat\u2019s important is that the prototype meets all the requirements,\u201d he said.\n\nHassan believes the Arab region is aware of the dangers of a shortage of ventilators at this time, pointing to countries such as Jordan, Palestine, Morocco, Algeria and others that have contacted him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployees of a private company spray sanitising liquid around a bank in a bid to limit the spread of the cornonavirus Covid-19, in the Lebanese capital Beirut.

This, coupled with their determination, will enable them to achieve their goal.\u201d\n\nAnother Lebanese innovator who is not counting on divine providence is Jad Berro, who said it became obvious to him about two weeks ago that the coronavirus pandemic was not going to spare Lebanon.\n\nHe began working in mid-March on a prototype of a basic automated bag valve mask.\n\n\u201cLacking enough medical information at the time on mechanical ventilation, the general thought was that something simple could solve the imminent problem of ventilator shortage,\u201d he told Arab News.\n\nFAST FACT 800,000 Additional ventilators needed globally\n\n\u201cI make a living out of making products and prototypes, so we had a basic ventilator running (within a few days). This was a record by any standards.\u201d\n\nElaborating on the contraption, Berro said: \u201cThe prototype can control the tidal volume, breaths per minute and the inhale-to-exhale ratio, with monitoring of excess pressure and internal self-tests to guarantee that the mechanism is functioning normally at all times.\u201d But the functions are \u201cvery basic\u201d and cannot be a replacement for a ventilator, he admits.\n\nBerro said he halted production out of \u201cethical and moral concerns\u201d as using it would have meant hooking patients to a device that had not been properly tested and did not offer any guarantee it would work for extended periods of time.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s needed is a unified basic design that\u2019s proven and tested, after which it might be possible to actually manufacture the machine,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployees of a Lebanese public health company pose with their protective gear on in Beirut March 24, 2020. (AFP\/File Photo)\n\n\n\n\u201cNumbers in Lebanon show that we have close to around 600 ventilators. The absolute worst-case surge requirement would be around 2,800. The crisis is global and the deficiencies are the same worldwide.\u201d\n\nIt is estimated that worldwide, about 10 percent of patients with COVID-19 infection need ventilators.\n\nReports say about 880,000 more ventilators will be needed to deal with the demand caused by the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBerro said efforts are being made to technologically enable one ventilator to service multiple patients of similar lung capacities.\n\n\u201cAs global manufacturers are gearing up production of ventilators and medical devices, we can expect a slight relief,\u201d he added.\n\nFAST FACT 10% Percentage of COVID-19 patients who need ventilators\n\n\u201cChina seems to have successfully flattened the curve and might be able to send ventilators and medical supplies to other parts of the globe. A used ventilator is certainly better than a makeshift one.\u201d\n\nAnother Lebanese ventilator prototype has been unveiled by MP Neemat Frem two weeks after he initiated a project in collaboration with a group of specialized engineers and doctors.\n\nThe machine, targeted for use in intensive care units (ICUs) in Lebanese hospitals, is being built to high specifications, incorporating the latest technological features developed by Phoenix Co., an affiliate of Lebanon\u2019s INDEVCO Industrial Group.\n\n\u201cWe decided to fight with all our means in Lebanon,\u201d said Frem, who is also the group CEO. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have accepted the prospect of dying without doing anything, so we decided to put in all our efforts and strength, and it\u2019s starting to yield results.\u201d\n\nClinical trials of the ventilators are estimated very soon, he said, adding that plans are simultaneously afoot to manufacture face masks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe still need some progress on the human-to-machine interface, which is the design,\u201d he told Arab News.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fabricating the most complicated version of the ventilator \u2014 that is, the one used in ICUs.\u201d\n\nPhoenix Co.\u2019s project had kicked off with a six-hour briefing by doctors, which was followed by the creation of a small taskforce comprising doctors, suppliers and biomedical engineers.\n\nThe challenge for Lebanon and other Arab countries, according to Frem, will be in purchasing material used to build ventilators in the needed quantities.\n\n\u201cI presume the coronavirus crisis will add stress on suppliers in Europe, the US and the Far East,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re now in sourcing mode \u2014 to locate what\u2019s available, starting with our main suppliers.\u201d\n\nFrem feels Lebanon is not prepared for a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases, noting that at the current rate, \u201cwe\u2019ll have big numbers in 50 days, which is worrying.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, \u201cit\u2019s encouraging to see the fantastic work of startups and engineers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get rid of this \u2018can\u2019t do\u2019 attitude in the Middle East once and for all. We\u2019ll never surrender.\u201d\n\nBerro offered a similar take on the looming ventilator shortage amid the regional coronavirus crisis.\n\n\u201cArabs survive on imports in times of prosperity as well as in times of crises,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t acceptable and needs to change.\u201d","tests":null,"ventilators":"['600 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Huete-Perez* (Confidencial)\n\nHAVANA TIMES \u2013 Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is considered an essential tool in the fight against the pandemic that, as of March 31, has infected over 900,000 people and caused the death of more than 47,000 globally.\n\nTesting, along with social distancing and contact tracing have been the corner stone of the strategy for combatting the pandemic. Thus, after only five days of the epidemic being declared a pandemic, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghereyesus, director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) made an urgent call for all countries to consider diagnostic testing for coronavirus a major priority.\n\nThe importance of timely detection of any viral outbreak has been recognized by the international scientific community, and is noteworthy in the experiences of countries that have achieved successful management of the epidemic (Singapore and South Korea, among others), because they carried out thousands of tests from the very beginning. On the contrary, those countries deficient in managing the epidemic, such as the US and Spain, did little testing or tracking of outbreaks in a timely manner which resulted in hospitals and clinics overflowing with patients and causing an intolerable overload for medical personnel.\n\nThe use of the technique known as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for the diagnostic testing of COVID-19 has been key. This molecular biology technique detects the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through tiny quantities of viral genetic material (RNA) obtained from a sample taken by a cotton swab from the nose and throat of infected persons. Due to being a highly versatile technique invented some decades ago, some of even the poorest countries now have the capability to use this kind of diagnostic tool.\n\nIn Nicaragua, the Ministry of Health (MINSA) began employing techniques using PCR for detecting various pathogens beginning in the 1990s with the aid of international financing and has benefited from decades of collaboration with prestigious United States\u2019 laboratories.\n\nIt is therefore beyond all reason that despite having the technical capacity to detect coronavirus, the government has opted to not implement systematic, comprehensive and timely diagnostic testing, which should have begun this past February when the virus appeared in the region. The situation became even more grave when Nicaragua was left totally exposed as a result of the failure to establish containment measures such as closing borders, restricting the arrival of tourists from affected countries or establishing quarantines, such as other Central American governments have done.\n\nAlthough the government recognizes only 5 positive cases, the true number of COVID-19 cases in Nicaragua remains unknown. The scarcity of cases can only be explained by a lack of sufficient testing. It is deplorable that MINSA officials admitted 4 days ago that only some 200 tests have been carried out, when, at this stage they should have carried out at least 3 to 5 thousand tests if one considers the testing capacity of even one modest laboratory.\n\nKeep in mind that what the government refers to as \u201cpositive cases\u201d are those cases that they have managed to identify, or perhaps the number they find convenient to admit exist. After all, withholding information and spreading misinformation has been the longstanding practice. Even worse are the government\u2019s decisions to program events with massive attendance, in direct contradiction to WHO recommendations.\n\nThese kinds of decisions, based purely on political scheming and in disregard for scientific and technical criteria which should be taking precedence, have caused immense social and economic harm to the country on prior occasions. Good examples are the failed Inter-oceanic Canal Project, the destruction of natural reserves and the financial ruining of the social security system \u2013 all of which have brought about the institutional debacle in which the country finds itself.\n\nDespite such a marked delay, it is imperative that massive testing begin immediately. It could at least be done randomly at the airports, borders crossings, and in the most populated neighborhoods; patients with pneumonia could also be prioritized for testing as their clinical profile overlaps with COVID-19.\n\nAlthough the most logical approach, from an epidemiological point of view, was to carry out comprehensive testing in the first weeks of the outbreak in Central America, it\u2019s still advisable to discover the epidemic\u2019s principal hotspots. This is important not only because without a correct diagnosis we can\u2019t know the true number of infections, but because without knowing, we aren\u2019t able to take the necessary actions. Without adequate sampling, we won\u2019t know the true magnitude of the epidemic within Nicaragua.\n\nFortunately, other countries now have more rapid and less expensive serologic testing for detecting COVID-19 and diagnostic kits could easily be imported. While the PCR method, which provides results in 3 to 4 hours, requires a well-equipped laboratory and highly trained personnel, the serologic tests produce results in 5 to 15 minutes, are inexpensive and don\u2019t require specialized personnel. These rapid tests are now in use in Europe and could be incorporated into general detection strategies, aiding central laboratories when they become saturated.\n\nIn addition, these rapid tests (PCR or immunochromatographic) which can detect the virus or antibodies against the virus would also reveal the spread of COVID-19, providing vital information for public health personnel.\n\nDespite the difficult situation in which Nicaragua has found itself, overwhelmed by 24 months of socio-political crisis since the April 2018 Rebellion, the citizens themselves have adopted their own methods of prevention with much wisdom and courage. In addition, the Academy of Sciences, the Multidisciplinary Scientific Committee and various medical and civil society organizations have guided the population regarding the pandemic.\n\nIt is also important to include in this struggle (against coronavirus) the broad range of national scientific capacity that has been growing over the last forty years through continual research, representing an unquestionably valuable resource within our universities. These researchers can contribute knowledge and study the situation, from an independent epidemiologist monitoring the presence of COVID-19 and the status of concomitant morbidities in hospitals and clinics, to a specialist in biotechnology identifying the coronavirus mutations which to date has 8 known variants. Molecular biologists can determine the genomic sequence and mutations of coronavirus within Nicaragua, explaining, for example, how the different strains of the virus enter human cells, which could aid in determining future medications.\n\nMedical teams could conduct clinical trials in conjunction with \u201cSolidarity\u201d, an international consortium testing the effectiveness of various pharmaceuticals against the virus. Interdisciplinary teams of students in engineering, biology and medicine could reconstruct or create low-cost ventilators along with other practical solutions. Activating the national research system to address the epidemic would serve to improve patient primary care and survival.\n\nWe are in urgent need of producing specialized protective equipment so that health professionals can safely confront the escalating surge of infection that could occur within a few weeks. It\u2019s been shocking and unpardonable that doctors, health personnel and health brigade workers have been thrown into the battle without any defenses such as masks or gloves or other mandatory supplies.\n\nAt the same time, one hopes that other measures adopted by neighboring countries, such as closing borders, reducing international flights, and lower numbers of tourists has reduced the spreading of the virus toward Nicaragua, resulting in a delay of the COVID-19 impact. As testing becomes more generalized and the number of confirmed cases increases, a clearer image of the rate at which the virus is spreading in Nicaragua will appear.\n\n*PhD.

Chamorro, a leader of the Civic Alliance affirms: \u201cUnder no circumstances\u201d will a truce with the regime be declared.\n\nBy Confidencial\n\nHAVANA TIMES \u2013 The Covid-19 pandemic is hitting Nicaragua at a time when it\u2019s a de facto police state and in its third year of economic recession, after the crisis resulting from the Ortega regime\u2019s repression of the April 2018 rebellion. It\u2019s also occurring during an extended period of absence on the part of Daniel Ortega, who this time has gone 24 days without appearing or speaking in public, even though over fifteen days ago the first positive case of the novel Coronavirus was confirmed in Nicaragua.\n\nOrtega\u2019s absence is a manifestation of the lack of \u201cleadership\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019ll be a bill to pay\u201d with the emergency, stated Juan Sebastian Chamorro, executive director of the Civic Alliance for Justice and Democracy.\n\nOrtega didn\u2019t even appear on Friday in the posthumous homage offered to deceased deputy Jacinto Suarez, Ortega\u2019s cellmate during the Somoza dictatorship.\n\n\u201cThis absence is more notable (because of the pandemic). For those who follow him, that absence of \u201cleadership is truly regrettable,\u201d commented Chamorro during an interview on the internet news program Esta Semana, which is transmitted via YouTube and Facebook Live, due to the television censorship that the regime imposed in January 2019.\n\nWhile the presidents of other countries are heading up the emergency response, together with specialized medical personnel, \u201cwhat we\u2019re seeing here is a total absence, and rather strange messages,\u201d criticized Chamorro, after remarking on the destitution of the former Health Minister (Carolina Davila), and \u201cthe apparent resignation of the head of the Intensive Care Unit of the German-Nicaraguan Hospital.\u201d In his view, these things \u201cindicate that something is happening, and it\u2019s serious.\u201d\n\nResponse of the activist citizens\n\nChamorro highlighted that in the face of the vacuum in presidential authority, civil society, the Catholic Church, the business community and the National Coalition have adopted their own preventive measures against the pandemic. The novel Coronavirus has now infected over 1.3 million people all over the world, and caused over 76,000 deaths, while some 282,000 have recovered.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no [emergency] decree here from the official point of view, but there\u2019s been a people\u2019s decree: citizens are responding to the call of the different organizations. Very early on, the Episcopal Conference issued important statements about what to do. What\u2019s being seen is a self-organized movement for protection from the pandemic,\u201d he stated.\n\nChamorro emphasized the Civic Alliance\u2019s commitment to preventive actions in the face of the pandemic, and the outreach of their member organizations, such as Nicaraguan Medical Unity and the student movements, to inform and alert the population engaged in a self-declared quarantine.\n\nThe regime\u2019s lack of response has also caused at least two Central American presidents \u2013 Nayib Bukele of El Salvador and Carlos Alvarado of Costa Rica \u2013 to express their concern for the Ortega government\u2019s negligence in the face of the novel Coronavirus. In addition to not adopting the measures internationally recommended, the regime insists on promoting large gatherings and mass activities.\n\n\u201cEverything sets Nicaragua completely apart from the rest of the Central America countries. This negligence is visible, people are noticing, the population is waiting for the state to respond to the need for information,\u201d Chamorro declared.\n\nCovid-19 under an authoritarian regime\n\nThe Central American Institute for Business Administration (Incae) published a message to the nation last March 31, urging that the government and all the social figures of importance, including the Church and the communities, \u201cto work together and in a coordinated way to prepare for confronting this mortal virus,\u201d arguing that \u201cin this moment, we need to think about saving lives and put to one side differences of any kind.\u201d\n\nUp until now, the regime of Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo has ignored the Incae petition. Nonetheless, the Executive Director of the Civic Alliance feels that there\u2019s no room for a truce with the regime.\n\nTwo years after the social explosion that was brutally repressed by the dictatorship, at least 328 murders remain uninvestigated and unpunished. There are still some 70 Nicaraguans who are political prisoners, and there are more than 100,000 Nicaraguans in exile due to the political persecution. At least 30 people who opposed the regime have been killed in the rural areas of Nicaragua.\n\n\u201cFirst, they have to reestablish the public freedoms; and then, if they want all the active forces to concur, then there must be a consensus to put into effect everything the WHO is recommending \u2013 to suspend classes, close the borders, and establish a quarantine.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder no circumstances can the Civic Alliance subscribe to the concept of a truce,\u201d maintained Chamorro.\n\nProtection for the Health Workers\n\nIn their call to the population, Incae also asked for the coordination of public and private actions in the face of the Covid-19 emergency. This proposal has been backed by the private sector, but the government has failed to respond to it.\n\n\u201cIn Nicaragua, the virus is just beginning to propagate, so that the nation still has time to take the necessary measures,\u201d alerted the Incae communique. It then suggested prioritizing \u201cthe strengthening of the capacity and security of the national health system and their professionals,\u201d giving them the essential gear and instruments \u201cto work during the pandemic, protect the most vulnerable, assure the supply of key inputs to fulfill the basic needs of the population, and so to contribute to reducing the global impact of Covid-19 on the economy, employment and poverty.\u201d\n\nChamorro emphasized that it\u2019s important to have the \u201cconcurrence\u201d of all sectors of society to confront the pandemic, because it\u2019s a problem that goes beyond the capabilities of one or another organization alone, even the State.\n\n\u201cThe private sector made a very important decision when they said that they could put in their resources. The formation of a fund to attend to the emergency is important, because it will be utilized to be able to purchase protective equipment for people on the front lines. I\u2019m speaking of the health professionals in both the private and the public sector.\u201d\n\nMassive testing urged\n\nChamorro added that among the fundamental items for the emergency is the need to carry out massive testing.\n\nThe regime has centralized the realization of Covid-19 tests in the \u201cConchita Palacios\u201d Health Complex administered by the Health Ministry. It continues to withhold information on the number of tests that have been done to date. In addition, health workers in the public hospitals of the country have denounced to Confidencial that the regime has forbid them to use the minimal measures of protection to prevent contagion (such as masks, gloves and gel alcohol) under the argument of \u201cnot alarming\u201d the population.\n\nChamorro insisted that at least 100,000 tests should be conducted all over the country to detect where the infectious hot spots are, reduce the uncertainty and help eliminate that policy of secrecy that the regime maintains. Basically, they\u2019ve merely informed people that they should wash their hands and go to the closest hospital or health center if they have symptoms.\n\nLast Thursday, the president of the National Assembly Gustavo Porras, formerly a labor leader with the Federation of Health Workers and currently under sanctions imposed by the United States and Canada, justified the regime\u2019s negligence by declaring that he doesn\u2019t see the need to \u201cmake a big fuss\u201d over \u201csporadic cases\u201d of Covid-19 in Nicaragua.\n\nChamorro feels that it\u2019s better to put people on alert and make sure they\u2019re fully informed about the pandemic, than to sin by omission.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what happened in places where the pandemic could have been contained but where it went out of control. In South Korea, a country of 51 million inhabitants, there were 10,000 infected and 177 deaths. And why? Because they did massive testing. In Ecuador, they were poking around like a blind person with a cane, and we\u2019re seeing the consequences. We still have time, but all of the recommendations must be taken seriously,\u201d he advised.\n\nFunds for the regime\n\nThe government has advocated in the United Nations for the lifting of sanctions imposed by the governments of the US and Canada due to the regime\u2019s repression and human rights\u2019 violations in Nicaragua. Their argument is that they need to obtain access to international resources for the emergency.\n\nNonetheless, Chamorro noted that the sanctions were imposed against the regime functionaries for their involvement in human rights violations, crimes and electoral fraud, and explained that from the opposition camp they\u2019ve never advocated for the suspension of resources needed for basic necessities, much less under circumstances of a national pandemic emergency.\n\n\u201cResources are needed for all this, and I believe that it\u2019s important for the international community, the private sector and all of those who can help to join this chain of solidarity. This chain of solidarity consists in finding financial and physical resources like equipment, protective materials for the battle that\u2019s coming,\u201d Chamorro declared.\n\nHowever, he also warned of the need to reinforce the accountability and transparency mechanisms of the international organizations to counteract the government\u2019s opaque public administration.\n\nThe impact on the national economy\n\nAll the front pages of the international and national media have been absorbed by the Covid-19 advance in the last months. Although there\u2019s been talk of prevention and the actions that should be taken to save lives, it\u2019s an undeniable fact that the pandemic has had a huge impact on the world economy.\n\nThe estimate of the economic impact on a world level, according to Chamorro, is a 3 percent contraction; in the case of Nicaragua, growth previously was at -1. So, a drop of -5 is now estimated, since some 80% of the Nicaraguan economy depends on the United States. That is, it depends in large measure on imports and family remittances, and these are going to suffer greatly.\n\n\u201cIn order for us to have a vision of the magnitude of the crisis on a global level, during the 2009 crisis, there were 900,000 people left unemployed in the United States. Today, three million jobs have been lost. This is naturally going to have repercussions in the Nicaraguan economy that in addition came into this pandemic in an extremely vulnerable situation,\u201d Chamorro reiterated.\n\nThose vulnerable situations he refers to are the reduction in the taxes collected; the situation of Social Security with a deficit of over US $120 million; and the fiscal capacity of the State, that will be seriously reduced with this crisis.\n\n\u201cSome companies in Nicaragua in the last two weeks have sent over 50,000 workers on vacation. Also,\u201d he added, \u201cthere are free trade zones that are closed, and if all of them close it will mean greater unemployment and poverty.\u201d Chamorro indicated that this time there\u2019s so escape valve for the citizens, since as a result of the borders closing, they can\u2019t emigrate to find work.\n\nIn addition to the Assistance Fund being promoted by the private sector, he challenged the government to adopt measures for social protection for those most affected by the unemployment and poverty, and insisted that this crisis must be met with a commitment for actions of \u201csolidarity\u201d.","tests":"['100,000 tests', '19 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

By downplaying the danger of the pandemic and increasing the risk of community transmission in the second-poorest country in the western hemisphere,\n\nthe Nicaraguan government is violating the human rights of its citizens.\n\nNicaragua is the only country in Central America that has yet to declare a state of emergency in response to the outbreak.\n\nAlthough the country has recommended self-quarantine for travelers coming from particular countries, the government has not restricted travel, closed borders or, most importantly, suspended schooling or public events.\n\nA leaked document from the Nicaraguan Health Ministry (Minsa) has underscored the probable consequences of this haphazard response. Public health officials have privately predicted that up to 32,500 Nicaraguans could test positive for COVID-19, 8,125 of whom could have severe symptoms and 1,016 of whom might require intensive care beds.\n\nNicaragua has only 160 ventilators available, 80% of which are currently in use.\n\nIf the government\u2019s senior leadership continues to ignore calls for strong mitigation efforts, the fragile public health infrastructure could collapse under the pressure of widespread infection.\n\nMeanwhile, other Central American countries have responded proactively to the pandemic. El Salvador instituted a nationwide 30-day quarantine, along with strict travel restrictions.\n\nNeighbouring Costa Rica and Honduras have also closed borders.\n\nIndeed, nearly every country in Latin America\u2014including poorly-resourced and crisis-ridden governments, such as those of Venezuela, Honduras, and Guatemala\u2014has taken action to mitigate the spread of the disease.\n\nThe Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele criticized the absence of social distancing measures in Nicaragua, suggesting that the country\u2019s negligence could pose a risk to the region and undermine the plans of neighboring countries to confront the pandemic.\n\nThe health infrastructure and medical community in Nicaragua, already beset by difficulties inflicted by a capricious political regime, are ill-equipped to withstand a massive influx of severely ill patients to hospitals. At 0\u00b79 hospital beds per 1000 people, Nicaragua lags behind the Latin American average of 2\u00b72 beds per 1000 people.\n\nFurther, Nicaragua is the poorest country in Central America, with a third of Nicaraguans living in poverty and nearly 10% living in extreme poverty.\n\nOther countries with more resources than Nicaragua are struggling to contain infections and deaths from the virus.\n\nThis situation underscores the need for resource-limited countries to focus on early prevention and containment efforts as their main strength in the fight against COVID-19.\n\nGiven the Nicaraguan government\u2019s careless response and the country\u2019s fragile health infrastructure, it is crucial that WHO, PAHO, and leaders of the global health community take immediate action to help prevent the loss of thousands of lives.\n\nAdvertisements","tests":null,"ventilators":"['160 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

Epidemiologist urges them to inform and educate the public.\n\nBy Ivette Munguia (Confidencial)\n\nHAVANA TIMES \u2013 The hermetic silence from the regime of Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo regarding the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, and the scant information being offered about how to prevent the illness has generated increased uncertainty in Nicaragua.\n\nThe Ministry of Health (Minsa) hasn\u2019t yet explained to the public the measures they will implement in the face of the imminent arrival of the virus in Nicaragua. Such information is already being disseminated in other countries of Central America, but here they merely assure that \u201cthanks to God\u201d there are no confirmed cases of the virus in the country.\n\nThe inertia of the public health authorities could cause even more damage than the disease itself, reflects epidemiologist Leonel Arguello. Minsa does have \u201cthe tests and the training\u201d necessary to diagnose the new virus, whose symptoms are similar to seasonal flu, but the silence around everything related to the pandemic could have negative repercussions in the health of the population.\n\nUp through Thursday, the pandemic has registered 126,283 positive cases worldwide, has caused 4,724 deaths, and has now extended to over 120 countries around the world, twelve of them in Latin America, including Nicaragua\u2019s neighbors Costa Rica, Honduras and Panama. The latter announced the region\u2019s first confirmed death from the virus, a 64-year-old man who had additional health complications.\n\nLack of information fertile ground for panic\n\nCovid-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a type of Coronavirus recently discovered in Wuhan, China. \u201cSome 86% of the cases present as common flu,\u201d affirms the epidemiologist, but he warns that \u201cthe remaining 14% lead to complications, and one part of these are going to be fatal,\u201d since there\u2019s no specific treatment in existence. The role of the health ministries is \u201cto rapidly detect cases, so as to avoid transmission\u201d of the disease.\n\nArguello said the state silence represents a \u201clack of prevention\u201d of the pandemic, because the population isn\u2019t being informed. As a result, \u201cpeople get hysterical, enter into panic, begin to spend money, begin to create scarcity, and people in business take advantage of that.\u201d\n\nAlthough the presence of the Corona virus has still not been confirmed in Nicaragua, this week a supermarket chain restricted the sales of sanitizing products to avoid hoarding, and the supply of face masks is running out in some of the country\u2019s pharmacies. Alcohol in liquid and gel form has also become scarce.\n\nMINSA projects 32,500 cases of the virus over the next 6 months\n\nA document obtained by Confidencial entitled \u201cPreparation and Response before the risk of Corona virus\u201d, elaborated by the Health Ministry in February, gives a projection of 32,500 people affected within 6 months after the virus enters the country. The calculation assumes a contagion rate of 0.5% in a 180 day period.\n\nAccording to Minsa\u2019s official projection: \u201cIt\u2019s estimated that there could be 32,500 cases, with 75% of them (24,375) being mild or moderate, and 25% (8,125) serious. If we project a fatality rate of 2.5%, we could see 813 deaths. Those deaths would comprise 80% of the patients who need the Intensive Care Units, for which we calculate that some 1,016 will pass through the Intensive Care Units.\u201d\n\nIn order to care for the serious patients, the Minsa document adds: 451 hospital beds will be needed for an average stay of 10 days, and of these, 79 of them in the intensive care units for a median stay of 14 days, with 79 ventilators, one per bed in the ICU.\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization indicates that those over 60 and those with preexisting medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung illness, cancer, or diabetes have the greatest risk of dying from Covid-19.\n\nDr. Arguello explains that each person infected with the virus could transmit it to an average of three more, so that the propagation of the virus will depend largely on the preventive actions that the Health Ministry and the population undertake.\n\nThe epidemiologist urged the government to wage a national prevention campaign, utilizing the media and the workplaces, since the virus is already in Nicaragua and the population hasn\u2019t been sufficiently informed about the myths and truths of the Coronavirus.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any information about whether this is being done on a local level in the communities and neighborhoods, because that\u2019s been their style of work, but this opportunity shouldn\u2019t be disregarded,\u201d to educate the population who right now are aware and demanding information, Arguello said.\n\nMurillo centralizes communication\n\nThe Coronavirus has raised alarms in nearly all parts of the world. Italy and El Salvador have decreed a national quarantine. The international organizations have reduced their estimates of world economic growth; in Costa Rica all large gatherings have been suspended. In Nicaragua, the regime has sent messages of solidarity to the affected countries, while in the hospitals of the capital alerts about the epidemic have been posted in the form of picturesque murals.\n\nVice President Rosario Murillo reiterated in her daily noon monologue that \u201cno type of quarantine\u201d will be established for travelers. In addition, \u201cthe people with some tie to the epidemic that present symptoms can go to a unit of the health department for study and follow up.\u201d\n\nShe explained that travelers that arrive from countries with confirmed cases of Covid-19 will have no restrictions for moving around in Nicaragua.\n\nIn addition to these measures, Minsa has stated that: \u201cif there are cases that offer indications and test positive for the Corona virus, they will be admitted to the established Health Unit to receive medical attention.\n\nHow is Minsa preparing?\n\nAccording to Minsa\u2019s Preparation and Response Protocol, an Inter-institutional Commission \u2013 made up of Minsa, the Interior Ministry, the Customs office, Civil Aeronautics and the International Airport, National Port Services, the Institute of Agricultural Sanitation and Protection and the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources \u2013 is responsible for prevention, early detection and adequate management of the cases of Covid-19 that may present themselves in the country.\n\nAt the country\u2019s points of entry such as the airport, border stations and maritime ports, a strict control has been established of those who enter the country. Airplane crews and workers for the Customs office must report to Minsa any case of suspected virus that should be transferred to the indicated hospital in an ambulance to be used exclusively for patients with this illness.\n\nIn some of the public hospitals they\u2019ve already defined isolation wards for people with symptoms of Covid-19. All suspected patients will be tested, and if the diagnosis is confirmed, that person will remain isolated until they no longer have symptoms. Simultaneously, Minsa will monitor for 14 days those people who have had contact with an infected patient.\n\nIn other matters, the health workers assigned to attend to patients with the Coronavirus must comply with strict security and hygiene measures to avoid contagion.\n\nIn case of death from the Corona virus, the bodies will be turned over to family members in closed coffins, and must be buried immediately to avoid greater exposure to the virus, explains the official protocol.\n\nPrevention of the disease is possible\n\nHandwashing with soap and water, or with an alcohol-based disinfectant is, up until now, the best form of preventing Covid-19 and other respiratory illnesses, as well as diarrhea, conjunctivitis or parasites, Dr. Arguello explains.\n\nPreventing the disease doesn\u2019t cost the State anything. Habits like coughing or sneezing into your elbow and maintaining a meter of distance between people help avoid contact with the droplets of liquid from an infected person.\n\nAnother method of prevention, which the epidemiologist insists on, is to avoid touching the eyes, nose and mouth to avoid transmitting the virus from the hands to the face. At present, there is no specific treatment for this novel Coronavirus.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['79 ventilators']","beds":"['451 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

Many Asian countries encouraged citizens to wear masks prior to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\n\n\u201c Many health experts believe that the widespread use of masks have helped many Asian countries to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. \u201d\n\nThe tide appears to be turning on face masks in the U.S. In a reversal of policy on Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a recommendation that the public wear improvised face masks, while still avoiding surgical, medical-grade N95 face masks. The agency cited \u201cnew evidence\u201d that COVID-19 can be spread from people who are asymptomatic. The masks, the CDC said, are designed to prevent the wearer from passing on the virus.\n\nHowever, widespread mask usage can only explain so much. South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore have all experienced bad coronavirus outbreaks in the past, and they learned lessons that the U.S. and other countries appear to have missed: the value of early testing.\n\nAs of Monday, the U.S., which has a population of roughly 372 million, has reported 337,933 cases of coronavirus and 9,653 deaths. South Korea, with a population of over 51 million, has reported 10,284 coronavirus cases, and 186 deaths. Singapore, which has a population of approximately 5.8 million, confirmed 1,309 coronavirus cases and 6 deaths.\n\nCase in point: In 2015, South Korea battled an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome that infected 186 people and killed 38 people. The first MERS case during that outbreak was traced to a 76-year-old businessman who returned from a trip to the Middle East. Because he was not diagnosed for several days, more people came into contact with him.\n\nThat ultimately ignited a chain reaction which eventually placed 17,000 people in quarantine. Before he was diagnosed with the virus, he visited four different hospitals in South Korea, according to a 2018 study on South Korea\u2019s response to the outbreak published in Asia Pacific Journal of Public Health. The country learned the importance of early testing.\n\n\u201c South Korea currently has the capacity to manufacture 100,000 test kits a day, and they can indicate whether a person has coronavirus within hours. \u201d\n\nAt that time, South Korea quickly got to work on developing tests. \u201cIn mid-January, our health authorities quickly conferred with the research institutions here,\u201d South Korea\u2019s foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, told the BBC, \u201cand then they shared that result with the pharmaceutical companies, who then produced the reagent [chemical] and the equipment needed for the testing.\u201d\n\nCurrently, the country manufactures 100,000 test kits a day that can indicate whether a person has coronavirus within hours, the New York Times reported. \u201cTesting is central because that leads to early detection. It minimizes further spread,\u201d Kang said, and it allows health authorities to quickly treat those who have the virus. \u201cThat\u2019s the key behind our very low fatality rate,\u201d she added.\n\nIn the U.S., two months after the disease was detected, many people still couldn\u2019t get tested, the Associated Press reported. That\u2019s partly because there was a limited supply of tests that were reserved only for people who had traveled to China and other parts of the world that reported high rates of infection. In February, as the coronavirus was tightening its grip on major U.S. cities like New York and Seattle and the virus was spreading in the community, U.S. laboratories processed only 352 COVID-19 tests, the CDC said.\n\nIsolating positive cases \u2014 even the mild ones\n\nLike South Korea, Singapore also encountered an outbreak similar to COVID-19. In 2002-2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infected 238 people \u2014 killing 33 of which. \u201cTransmission within the health-care and household settings accounted for more than 90% of the cases,\u201d according to a 2006 report published by Annals of the Academy of Medicine of Singapore.\n\n\u201c Singapore doesn\u2019t allow patients with COVID-19 to self-isolate at home even if they have a mild symptoms. That helps prevent family members catching it. \u201d\n\nAt the time, the Singapore reported a shortage of isolation rooms in hospitals. \u201cIt was aware then that its infrastructure wasn\u2019t ready for an outbreak of this kind,\u201d Dale Fisher, chair of infection control at the National University Hospital in Singapore, wrote in a post published in The Conversation, an online journal. \u201cSo, in the years since, isolation hospitals were built.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, Singapore doesn\u2019t allow patients who contract COVID-19 to self isolate at home even if they have a mild symptoms. \u201cHome quarantine is not easy. You\u2019re not supposed to mix with your family, you\u2019re supposed to have your own toilet, you\u2019re not supposed to have visitors,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep people at home, you need to be really sure they\u2019re not transmitting it.\u201d\n\nHospital bed shortages prompted New York\u2019s Gov. Andrew Cuomo to advocate for four temporary hospitals. New York State alone has reported over 122,911 cases, as of Monday morning, according to the state\u2019s health department. That exceeds the number of cases in all countries, except Spain and Italy.\n\nAggressive contact tracing also helps\n\nAfter the MERS outbreak, South Korea quickly implemented legislation that would allow health officials to aggressively trace the footsteps of citizens who test positive for an emerging infectious disease. Using security camera footage, credit-card records, GPS data from cellphones and car navigation systems, they are able to pinpoint exactly where a person has been.\n\n\u201c South Koreans are notified when a person in their district contracts COVID-19 and they are also given details of their whereabouts. \u201d\n\nSouth Koreans are also notified when a person in their district contracts COVID-19 and they are given highly detailed information about their whereabouts \u2014 including the exact bus they may have taken and whether or not they wore a mask. They don\u2019t, however, release their names.\n\nUnlike Singapore, South Koreans aren\u2019t required to check into a hospital if they are diagnosed with coronavirus. Instead, they are allowed to self-isolate at home. However, they are required to download another app, which alerts officials if they have left their homes. If they do so, they can be fined up to $2,500.\n\nImplementing this form of aggressive contact tracing in the U.S. highly unrealistic, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy think-tank based in Washington D.C.\n\n\u201cIf U.S. government said, \u2018We\u2019re going to do what South Korea is doing,\u2019 today, there would be serious privacy concerns and civil-liberty law suits that would make it impossible for to implement.\u201d What\u2019s more, Americans are already concerned about how their personal data is being used, Klingner, who worked as a CIA analyst for 20 years, said.\n\n\u201cPeople were so uncomfortable when they found out their Facebook FB, +1.98% information was hacked or leaked and their data was being used in ways they didn\u2019t know,\u201d he said referring to the Cambridge Analytica scandal in early 2018. (Facebook declined to respond to MarketWatch\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nImplementing emergency laws that allow more advanced contract tracing in the event of an infectious disease outbreak, \u201cseems like the kind of thing that may only be discussed as after item for when the country eventually weathers through the pandemic,\u201d Klingner added.\n\nBut members of the public wearing face masks helps, and early testing in particular appears to have worked in Singapore and South Korea, are two ways of trying to stop the spread of coronavirus, health professionals say.","tests":"['100,000 test kits']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has flooded hospitals worldwide with patients struggling to breathe.\n\nChairman Li Xiting, a Singapore citizen and the city-state\u2019s richest man, has added $3.5 billion to his net worth this year and had a $12.5 billion fortune as of end-Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That puts him among the top five gainers in the world. Jeff Bezos -- the world\u2019s richest person -- is up $3.4 billion, while Bill Gates is down $15.3 billion.\n\nThe global health crisis has exposed a shortage of ventilators -- the equipment health-care providers rely on to keep critically sick patients alive. While companies from Ford Motor Co. to General Motors Co. rush in to help ramp up production, Mindray\u2019s board secretary Li Wenmei said that global demand is at least 10 times what\u2019s available at hospitals. New York is just six days away from exhausting its supply, according to state Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\n\n\n\u00a9 Bloomberg Boosted by Crisis\n\nThe death toll worldwide has exceeded 52,000 while infections have topped 1 million. Italy and Spain are the most impacted in Europe, but the disease has also spread rapidly across the U.S., where President Donald Trump warned of 100,000 deaths or more.\n\nThe Society of Critical Care Medicine estimates that 960,000 patients would need ventilator support in the U.S., but the nation only has about 200,000 such machines. In Italy, the country with the most number of fatalities, a severe ventilator shortage has forced doctors to triage patients.\n\nUntil late last month, Mindray\u2019s ventilators didn\u2019t have approvals in the U.S. market but the Food and Drug Administration authorized their use under an emergency rule designed to help ease the shortage. That move has also boosted the prospects of Mindray.\n\nThat authorization is \u201cproviding opportunities for Chinese ventilator products to enter the U.S. market quickly,\u201d analysts led by Tian Jiaqiang at Citic Securities Co. wrote in a research note this week.\n\nMindray, which makes 3,000 ventilators a month, isn\u2019t the only manufacturer of the machine in China. Beijing Aeonmed Co. also got FDA authorization last month, according to the regulator\u2019s website. Shares of Jiangsu Yuyue Medical Equipment & Supply Co., another maker, have rallied 91% this year in Shenzhen, boosting its market value to $5.5 billion.\n\nGiant Rivals\n\nThough Mindray, with a market capitalization of $44 billion, is dwarfed by medical-device giants like Dublin-based Medtronic Plc, the Chinese firm has the potential to expand its market share, said Nikkie Lu, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s had a very good track record,\u201d with its products able to enter markets like Europe and Hong Kong, she said.\n\nIn an earnings filing this week, Mindray said orders from Europe especially have increased dramatically, with Italy purchasing the first batch of almost of 10,000 pieces of equipment including ventilators and monitors.\n\nThe company, which has 17 subsidiaries in China and operations in 30 countries, makes health monitoring systems, ventilators, defibrillators, anesthesia machines and infusion systems. The firm has a direct sales team in the U.S. and long-time global partners include Mayo Clinic, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, Massachusetts General Hospital and Cleveland Clinic, according to its annual report.\n\nNot Forever\n\nThe boost to the wealth of Mindray Chairman Li, who founded the firm in 1991 along with Xu and Cheng, contrasts with the erosion in net worth of his peers in Asia. Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong\u2019s richest man, has lost $7.1 billion this year as the city fights a recession from the double-whammy of the pandemic and last year\u2019s political protests. Singapore reported the biggest economic contraction in a decade in the first quarter, and expects a severe recession for the year.\n\nThe ventilator boom won\u2019t last forever, said Bloomberg Intelligence\u2019s Lu. As more societies age, demand will grow for breathing-support devices, but not to match the scale seen during this crisis, she said.\n\n\u201cSales will definitely drop after the outbreak.\u201d\n\n(Updates with latest case tally in fifth paragraph)\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['3,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

However by Wednesday that number had climbed to 1,900 and reached around 2,000 by Thursday, indicating a clear rise in tests performed.\n\nSalminen said that to date, authorities in Finland have performed nearly 30,000 tests for the virus. Last week Prime Minister Sanna Marin pledged that Finland would at least double testing capacity.\n\n\"We have been urged to test more and to lower the threshold [for testing] so this uncovers more cases. When we look at a graph of the epidemic where cases have been reported on the day samples were taken, then it is still relatively steady,\" he commented.\n\nSalminen noted however, that Finland is still in the early stages of the epidemic. \"We are still quite early [in the outbreak] and it is important to keep avoiding physical contact and to be diligent about hygiene,\" he cautioned.\n\nOutbreak to peak in May\n\nCurrent models are projecting that the peak of the outbreak will occur in May. According to Salminen developments over the next few weeks will provide a sharper picture of the situation.\n\n\"Our estimates are still quite uncertain and the peak may take even longer than we now believe. We will likely have to wait a few weeks to see some clarity in the situation,\" the director said.\n\nSalminen said that it currently looks like Finland has managed to slow the spread of the disease. \"It seems that the spread of the epidemic has slowed in Finland, especially compared to Sweden. We are moving forward more slowly, as was our intention,\" he remarked.\n\nLate records added to register\n\nOn Saturday morning the THL reported 267 new lab-confirmed infections in Finland, a number that was significantly larger than in previous daily updates. Salminen said that the high count was due to cases retroactively added to the national register of coronavirus infections.\n\n\"The majority of infections reported are from previous days and they can date back as far as a week,\" Salminen explained.\n\nHe said some reasons for the later additions were technical. He noted however that the delay in receiving lab results is quite small compared to the the sampling arc in the THL's reporting system.\n\n\"A few new labs have come on board and there has been a slight delay in quick and effortless reporting.\"\n\nHe called on people to treat reporting on the daily number of cases with caution and to pay more attention the numbers related to the date the samples were taken, as the latter figures are closer to the day that patients fell ill.\n\n\"Sometimes they are rounded off but they should not be taken to mean the entire number [of cases] from the previous day and that there were no new cases.

Our institute then made guidance and recommendations for PCR diagnostic testing, and it was rolled out to diagnostic labs across the country.\" The country has since tested 101,986 people for the virus, or 18,996 per million people - compared to little over 2,250 tests per million people in the UK. The country's enormous testing capacity may be part of the reason why it has been so successful in keeping the virus under control, with just 66 deaths recorded as of Sunday.\n\nEmpty streets during Norway's lockdown Credit : Odin Jaeger\/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cWe are one of the countries that has tested the highest percentage of our population and the assumption would be that the more you test, the more mild cases you will have among the confirmed cases, and more mild cases in the denominator will impact the estimation of the mortality,\" said Mr Vestrheim. He said that widespread testing may also have made it easier to slow the spread of the disease. \"The more you test, the more people with mild symptoms you find, and you can also do contact tracing and quarantine around people with those mild cases,\" he said. Some 5,208 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Norway, meaning less than five per cent of those who have reported symptoms and been tested turned out to have the virus. Dag Berild, a medical doctor and Associate Professor at Olso University Hospital, argued that the low level of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in Norwegian hospitals may also have played a role in the low mortality rate. \"Many of the influenza pneumonia cases are complicated by bacterial pneumonia, so if that is also the case with coronavirus, then patients in a country with a low resistance rate among bacteria would have a better prognosis than those in Italy, where they have an awful lot of resistant bacteria, particularly in Lombardy,\" he said. Mr Vestrheim said that expanding Norway's testing capacity had not been easy. \"There have been shortages of analytics, for equipment to do the extraction before the PCR testing, for the swabs that you use to take the specimens,\" he said. \"There's also a huge shortage of protective equipment for health personnel.\"\n\nBeds laid out at a makeshift shelter for the homeless amid the coronavirus lockdown Credit : Reuters","tests":"['2,250 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

I was fortunate to have worked at Radio ELWA from the late 1970s to the early 1980s as a newscaster and football commentator alongside such giants as Railey Gompah and the late Moses Washington. My cousin Gabriel Nimley, former Minister of Information was a product of Radio ELWA.\n\n\n\nNow, I am sure ELWA Hospital should have a say as to the cause of death of Mr. John Teah. Mr. Teah was admitted at the Hospital on Wednesday and died on Friday. Are you saying ELWA Hospital does not have the sophistication to medically determine the cause of death\/autopsy of Mr. Teah? If Mr. Teah died from the Coronavirus or from other causes, the Hospital has an obligation to inform the family first, and then to tell the government later if he died from the Coronavirus.\n\n\n\nCommon sense tells you that the National Public Health Institute of Liberia Coronavirus Task Force should have had teams assigned at every major medical center and Ports of Entry throughout Montserrado and Margibi Counties that fall under the Coronavirus National Health Emergency Declaration imposed nearly two weeks now. Is the Coronavirus Task Force testing all dead bodies in Montserrado and Margibi Counties? If not then why was it necessary to test Mr. Teah after he died and not when he was alive and admitted at the ELWA Hospital? Just curious.\n\n\n\nLiberians were told by the Minister of Health, Dr. Jallah that the World Health Organization (WHO) donated \u201c20,000 test kits\u201d to Liberia to help fight Covid-19. Or, the least the Task Force could do is to train and provide experts and test kits at all hospitals in Montserrado and Margibi Counties. Now Mr. Teah\u2019s family members, already traumatized from his death, have been arrested in an effort to determine if they too are infected but could be done in a humane manner.\n\n\n\nThe government\u2019s testing system has been flawed from the beginning and politicized where they \u201cpick-and-choose\u201d who is tested and not tested. ANC opposition party leader Alex Cummings is an example who was subjected to be quarantined after he returned from a visit to Ghana. Ironically, some lawmakers and cabinet ministers and the Mayor of Monrovia recently visited Corona hot zone countries including Sweden, France, Italy and Ghana and did not undergo the government designated, dilapidated mandatory quarantine hotels, some with no running water, electricity and flush toilets. Instead, the big shots chose to \u201cself-quarantine\u201d in their homes.\n\n\n\nAdd to the capacity of the government the $40 million worth of test kits, face masks, hand gloves, gowns and hand sanitizers that America donated to Liberia this week. Corona could be more deadlier than the 2014 Ebola outbreak that killed nearly 5,000 Liberians. The Coronavirus does not discriminate based on one\u2019s social status and position in government as we are witnessing in other countries. Hope Ebola taught us some lessons. Again, our broken and neglected healthcare system is being exposed. Town trap not for rat alone.\n\n\n\nJust a thought and not a sermon.\n\n\n\nJerry Wehtee Wion,\n\nWashington, DC, USA\n\n[email protected]","tests":"['20,000 test kits']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Like healthcare providers across the country, she tends to patients\u2013often taking their vitals and feeding and bathing them\u2013without an adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\nThe lack of PPE, including N-95 medical masks, for healthcare workers is a growing problem. On Monday afternoon, Governor Tim Walz issued an executive order requiring businesses and nonprofits in the state to inventory their supply of PPE for potential use in hospitals and clinics.\n\nSometimes Wreh-Fofana, who is in her 50s, doesn\u2019t find out until after she\u2019s met with a patient that they\u2019ve come to the hospital to be treated for symptoms consistent with COVID-19. \u201cBy then, you\u2019ve already dealt with the person, unprotected,\u201d she said. \u201cSo then, what happens to you after you\u2019ve dealt with that person? It\u2019s kind of scary.\u201d\n\nThe situation is causing fear among nurses and nursing assistants like Wreh-Fofana throughout the industry, she said. Some workers have to make tough choices between their jobs and the safety of their families. Wreh-Fofana speculates that some of her colleagues at the hospital have chosen to stay home to avoid the risk.\n\nThat\u2019s not the choice Wreh-Fofana is willing to make. She plans to carry on and work through the pandemic. She\u2019s even picking up a few extra shifts here and there. \u201cWe are working because we made a commitment to serve people, to take care of them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing our best.\u201d\n\nWreh-Fofana came to the U.S. in 2002 on a health visa for medical treatment for her son, who required three open heart surgeries at a young age. She stayed under a program designed to allow people from certain countries facing upheaval and instability to remain in the U.S. on a temporary basis. An order from President Trump nearly ended the program. But, last December, he signed a defense omnibus bill that included the Liberian Immigration Fairness Act, which opened a pathway to citizenship.\n\nShe has since applied for permanent residency under the new law, though she still needs to submit to the required fingerprinting and is expecting delays.\n\nAccording to a 2017 report from the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development, foreign-born workers tend to take up occupations that are facing critical workforce shortages, such as nursing and personal and home health care. In 2015, according to the report, 15.4 percent of nurses, psychiatric workers, and home health aids in the state were immigrants. Twenty-two percent of physicians and surgeons were foreign-born.\n\nHannah Lichtsinn, a primary care doctor at HealthPartners and co-founder of the Minnesota Immigrant Health Care Alliance, an advocacy group, said front-line health workers like Wreh-Fofana and those staffing emergency rooms are likely experiencing the most exposure to the virus right now. \u201cI\u2019m worried about our health care systems being overrun by people who are sick, and we don\u2019t have the supplies and staff to care for them,\u201d Lichtsinn said. \u201cI\u2019m worried about the economic impact on our communities\u2014all the people in [industries like] food service and transportation who don\u2019t have paid leave, who don\u2019t have much savings, and who don\u2019t have the capacity to work from home.\u201d\n\nLichtsinn predicted the pandemic could take an especially hard toll on immigrant communities. People without ample power and resources are at a high risk of suffering through the crisis, she said.\n\nShe is also worried that many immigrants will decline to get tested and treated for COVID-19 because of a lack of insurance and fear of accessing healthcare. For example, a new public charge rule, which the Trump administration enacted just last month, expands federal rules that deny immigrants green cards and certain visas if they are deemed too reliant on public aid programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. Last week, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced that public charge will not apply to immigrants seeking health care treatment for coronavirus or COVID-19.\n\nDespite that announcement, Lichtsinn said she was still worried that fear would prevent immigrants from seeking proper health care.\n\nSo far, Wreh-Fofana is not aware of coming into contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19. But, she knows that testing is backlogged and that many people with the virus don\u2019t exhibit symptoms. She said she and her colleagues do their best to wear gowns, gloves, and masks while treating patients. They wash and sanitize their hands after each appointment.\n\nShe has had no access to N-95 medical masks, she says, which are most effective in protecting medical workers from the novel coronavirus and which are in short supply across the country. \u201cMaybe other floors that have it, they are using it,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have not used it yet.\u201d\n\nSahan Journal\u2019s health coverage is supported in part by a generous gift from Delta Dental of Minnesota.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":"['95 medical masks']"}

We are in the top-tier obviously that changes day on day and it changes week on week,\u201d Glynn said.\n\nSo when we give the figure tomorrow then that can go into those reporting tools and our performance against other countries can be assessed. But what\u2019s been very clear, over the past period is that the issues we\u2019ve had around testing notwithstanding, we\u2019re still testing very significantly greater numbers proportionately than many other countries are doing.\n\nAs Glynn mentioned, the common approach to gauging testing rates across countries with different population is by giving the figure per million of population.\n\nThe 42,484 tests carried out in Ireland gives the country a testing rate of 8,663 tests per million. Last week, Ireland was at a testing rate of 6,165 tests per million.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Department of Health today confirmed that 213,181 tests have been completed, giving it a testing rate of 3,199 tests per million.\n\nTesting rates globally as per Monday (Ireland not included). Source: https:\/\/ourworldindata.org\/\n\nBy way of comparison, Our World in Data collates the testing rates across a range of countries worldwide.\n\nJudging by those numbers across a range of developed countries, Ireland comes in with similar testing levels as countries such as Denmark and South Korea and ahead of some EU peers but behind some of the leading countries worldwide.\n\nSpeaking this evening, Glynn said the department hasn\u2019t yet compared Ireland\u2019s testing numbers \u201cvis-a-vis\u201d other countries.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy to come back and answer that question for you tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nChief Clinical Officer at the HSE Dr Colm Henry added that testing strategies across different countries \u201care not the same\u201d.\n\n\u201cFrom early on in this country there\u2019s been a testing strategy, notwithstanding the difficulties we faced, and in other countries there hasn\u2019t been the same focus in testing. Yet the WHO have been very clear that a significant linchpin in the battle against Covid-19 is testing,\u201d he said.\n\nDeGascun also said this evening that the wait-time for people who aren\u2019t healthcare workers or in hospital to get test results after being swabbed was \u201cin the region of seven to 10 days\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe are prioritising cases from hospitals and healthcare workers because of the limitations on our capacity, turnaround time for those individuals is probably still in the region of 24 to 48 hours I would imagine,\u201d he said\n\nAsked by TheJournal.ie about delays for people getting results back after being swabbed, Henry acknowledged that \u201cdifficulties with our testing at lab level\u201d has led to \u201cincreased turnaround times\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident now based on the other suppliers we have a mainland Europe that we\u2019re able to shorten those turnaround times down to a much more acceptable level,\u201d he added.\n\n- With reporting by Michelle Hennessy","tests":"['8,663 tests', '3,199 tests', '42,484 tests', '6,165 tests', '12,271 tests', '15,000 tests', '213,181 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

A shortfall of 125 ventilators was also forecast.\n\nHowever, these calculations were based on the pre-pandemic availability of under 250 ICU beds in the State. This capacity has since been at least doubled, indicating a surplus of capacity under these modelling assumptions. The supply of ventilators has also been boosted.\n\nA total of 401 deaths are forecast in Ireland by the start of May but none thereafter to August 4th, the end of the modelling period, according to the research.\n\nHowever, NPHET officials in Ireland criticised the US research as unreliable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a model. It just took existing case data and suggested that because things seem to have stabilised over a short number of days that perhaps we\u2019ve reached a peak,\u201d said assistant chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t take into account any changes over the coming days or the highest number of deaths reported this evening.\u201d\n\nDr Glynn said Irish modelling being led by NUI Maynooth president Prof Philip Nolan was using a more extensive range of paramenters and people should wait to see what comes out of this work.\n\nPlacing \u201cundue store\u201d in the US research could lead to complacency, he warned.\n\nUK death toll\n\nThe study predicts 66,300 deaths in the UK, the highest number in Europe. The UK\u2019s use of bed resources is predicted to peak on April 17th and its deaths on April 20th.\n\nThe research says the peak of the pandemic has passed in many European countries, including in Spain, Italy and France, where 19,209, 20,300 and 15,058 deaths are predicted, respectively.\n\nThe model used by researchers is based on the social distancing measures introduced in New Zealand and also assumes complete adherence to these measures.\n\nThe research also suggests the end of the first wave of the pandemic could occur by early June and says that whether a second wave occurs depends on what is done then to prevent Covid-19 being reintroduced.\n\n\u201cBy the end of the first wave of the epidemic, an estimated 97 per cent of the population of the US will still be susceptible to the disease, and thus measures to avoid a second wave of the pandemic prior to vaccine availability will be necessary.\n\n\u2018\u201cIt is unequivocally evident that social distancing can, when well implemented and maintained, control the epidemic, leading to declining death rates,\u201d said IHME director Dr Christopher Murray.\n\n\u201cThose nations hit hard early on implemented social distancing orders and may have the worst behind them as they are seeing important progress in reducing their death rates. Each nation\u2019s trajectory will change \u2013 and dramatically for the worse \u2013 if people ease up on social distancing or relax other precautions.\n\n\u201cTo decrease the risk of a second wave in places where the first wave is controlled by robust social distancing, governments would need to consider mass testing, contact tracing, and quarantines for those infected until a vaccination is available, mass produced, and distributed widely.\u201d","tests":null,"ventilators":"['125 ventilators']","beds":"['88 ICU beds', '250 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

If that happens unchecked, our health system will be inundated, and tens of thousands New Zealanders will die.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the lockdown, particularly the closure of schools, should have happened much sooner. It was only announced after significant pressure from nurses, healthcare workers, teachers and other workers, including two widely supported petitions circulated by doctors.\n\nThe largest cluster of COVID-19 cases being tracked is at an Auckland girls\u2019 school, Marist College, in the suburb of Mount Albert. The Catholic school now has 72 confirmed cases, having escalated from 47 over recent days.

Only on March 31, a week into the lockdown and with over 700 confirmed cases, the government finally broadened testing criteria. There are now over 3,000 being conducted per day. Just under 40,000 tests have so far been done in a country with a population of five million.\n\nThe outbreak at Marist College emerged under these conditions. There were two possible sources of infection. The first was a teacher who fell ill in mid-March and took sick leave. Despite exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms she was unable to access a test without a doctor\u2019s referral because she had neither been overseas nor had contact with anyone recently returned.\n\nThe teacher was swabbed on March 19 and three days later the school informed parents, initially by text message, of the positive test and declared the school would be closed\u2014but only for three days.\n\nBy March 24, there were three confirmed cases of COVID-19 at the school, with all staff and students considered \u201cclose contacts.\u201d Principal Raechelle Taulu told the Herald the most likely point of transmission was the staffroom, which was a \u201cvery small space\u201d with a \u201clot of people\u201d. By March 25, a day before the nationwide lockdown, there were five cases, including the principal.\n\nThe Marist teacher had also recently attended a conference for Catholic schools in the Auckland Central region. Officials determined that the teacher was not infectious while at the conference. However, they have been unable to discover where the teacher had picked up her infection.\n\nThe second case involved a parent, Muliaga Brown, who has a daughter at the college. He told the media from hospital on April 1 that despite being severely ill for a week, he was twice denied testing over a four-day period because he didn\u2019t meet the criteria. Brown had begun feeling ill the week after he hosted an evening event at the college, which went ahead the day after the teacher was tested and was known by the school\u2019s management to be at risk.\n\nOn his attempts to access a test, Brown told the Herald: \u201cI had fever, body aches, could barely get out of bed\u2014I knew something was not right. I even mentioned my daughter went to Marist, but was again told I didn\u2019t meet the criteria.\u201d Despite subsequently self-isolating, Brown could have already been carrying the infection when he attended the function, and passed it on while he was asymptomatic.\n\nThe college continued to operate as normal throughout this period. A cultural night was held on March 14 and a parent and family meeting on March 18. The next day, the government banned gatherings of more than 100 people at indoor events, but this did not apply to schools, universities or other educational institutes.\n\nThe government kept schools open, despite mounting evidence of the dangers. Logan Park High School in Dunedin was closed for three days from March 18, after a pupil tested positive, along with his father who had been overseas. The Ministry of Health advised the school it could reopen as long as \u201cclose contacts\u201d of the student self-isolated.\n\nThe teacher unions demanded the schools remain open, until the imminent lockdown finally forced the issue. In a YouTube video on March 19, Post Primary Teachers Association (PPTA) Vice-President Melanie Webber absurdly declared, \u201cschools are safe places.\u201d She echoed the government\u2019s self-serving argument that closures would cause \u201cwidespread disruption to the community.\u201d\n\nIn a PPTA members\u2019 Facebook group another union official denounced calls for a strike as \u201calarmist language.\u201d The unions\u2019 position prompted angry comments including: \u201cWhere is the union on this? Not representing their members that\u2019s for sure\u2026 Are we all expendable?\u201d\n\nTwo days before the national lockdown was announced, the Teachers Council\u2014the state-backed body that oversees teacher registration and performance\u2014issued an open letter calling for all schools and early childhood centres to be shut forthwith. Labour\u2019s Education Minister Chris Hipkins responded that there was \u201cno need to change course.\u201d\n\nThe teacher unions again fell into line with the Ardern government and denounced the call. Liam Rutherford, president of the NZ Educational Institute, said the primary union supported the Ministry of Education\u2019s plan to close schools \u201conly when cases of coronavirus were found.\u201d PPTA President Jack Boyle said while provision should be made for teachers to teach online from home, schools must remain \u201copen for instruction.\u201d\n\nSections of business and the political establishment are already clamoring for the lockdown to be ended, forcing working people to risk their lives and health to defend the capitalist economy. Taking its cue from US President Trump, the Sunday Star Times demanded to know on its April 5 front page: \u201cWhen will this end, and could the solution be worse than the disease?\u201d\n\nThe author also recommends;\n\nNew Zealand workers speak out on unsafe conditions, wage cuts\n\n[2 April 2020]\n\nWorkers remain at risk during New Zealand\u2019s COVID-19 lockdown\n\n[28 March 2020]\n\nNew Zealand health workers speak out on lack of preparation for COVID-19 pandemic\n\n[24 March 2020]\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.","tests":"['40,000 tests', '500 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

A look at the numbers via the data of Worldometers.info.\n\nThe response to the coronavirus pandemic has elicited very different responses from a number of countries. The lockdown in China has proved extremely effective, whereas the more relaxed approach of Sweden is perhaps the most controversial strategy for a country trying to fight corona without major disruption to the economy. As we are living in a great unknown, far be it for me to judge who has the right or best approach, certainly at this stage.\n\nOne topic which is discussed at length is testing. Is there enough testing, and how many tests have been conducted in a given country.\n\nAs one has come to expect form the fantastic Worldometers.info website, there is a column of global data for that. Actually two, total tests and number of tests per 1 million population. So where does Croatia sit in all this?\n\nPresident Trump no doubt likes this chart, with the United States the clear leader in the number of tests conducted (which will, of course, be a large contributing factor to the large number of confirmed cases in the US). At almost 1.8 million tests, this is almost twice as many as the next country, Germany.\n\nHe is probably less likely to talk about this chart, which puts the 5,355 tests per million population in the States at number 41 out of the 208 countries being tracked.\n\nAnd Croatia? There is concern at the last of COVID-19 testing in Croatia in some quarters.\n\nAccording to the data provided, 10,874 tests have now been conducted in Croatia, which places Croatia 63rd in the table of tests conducted.\n\nCroatia is, of course, a small country, and it jumps 10 places to 53 in the table of number of tests per 1 million people - 2,649.\n\nThe website has now added a dedicated page for Croatia, where you can see more detailed data about the current situation here.\n\nFor the latest on the coronavirus crisis in Croatia, check out the dedicated TCN section.","tests":"['5,355 tests', '10,874 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Kemp said. \"This unique, public-private partnership will strengthen our testing capability as we continue to take the fight to COVID-19 in Georgia, and we are grateful for CVS Health's support to stop the spread of the virus.\"\n\nTesting will take place at a parking deck on Georgia Tech's campus, where officials will be able to accommodate multiple lanes of cars at one time. Health care providers, including nurse practitioners and physician assistants from MinuteClinic, the company's retail medical clinic, will be onsite to oversee testing.\n\nThe process will take approximately 30 minutes from specimen collection to delivery of results, and patients will need to pre-register in advance for a same-day appointment online at www.CVS.com\/minuteclinic\/covid-19-testing.\n\nDaughter of MLK named to Georgia coronavirus outreach group\n\nGeorgia's governor has named one of the daughters of The Rev.

Of those, 1,899 patients are hospitalized, which is about 20.7% of all cases.\n\nVirus-related deaths have sharply risen this week, jumping from 208 Saturday evening to nearly 350 only three days later.\n\nOf the 69 counties to report at least one death from COVID-19, Dougherty County remains the hardest hit with 56, followed by Fulton with 39 deaths and Cobb with 29. Dougherty also reported the most new deaths since noon with four, followed by Fulton and Gwinnett counties with three each.\n\nNearly 33,800 tests have been conducted across the state, and about 27.1% of those returned positive results.\n\nAt least 53.7% of those who died had a preexisting condition, and the DPH did not know whether 42.5% of victims had a preexisting condition. Only 13 victims were confirmed to not have another condition that could have contributed to their death aside from COVID-19.\n\nThe youngest victim in Georgia was a 29-year-old Peach County woman, while the oldest was a 100-year-old woman from Greene County.\n\nOnly four counties \u2014 Evans, Glascock, Montgomery and Taliaferro \u2014 have not recorded their first case. The remaining 155 counties in Georgia have at least one, with Fulton County topping the list with 1,185 confirmed cases.\n\nFulton also had the most new cases since noon with 61, followed by Dougherty with 34 and DeKalb with 28.\n\nAs of 7 p.m. Tuesday, there were 673 cases in DeKalb, 566 in Cobb, 540 in Gwinnett, 278 in Clayton, 215 in Hall, 208 in Henry, 191 in Bartow, 147 in Cherokee, 117 in Douglas, 99 in Forsyth, 86 in Rockdale, 81 in Fayette, 67 in Newton and 62 in Paulding.\n\nPatients between the ages of 18 and 59 make up the majority of cases at 59%, while those 60 and older make up 36%. The DPH does not release compiled data on how many patients have recovered.\n\nFor the full update, click here.\n\nORIGINAL STORY [noon]: For the second day in a row, the number of deaths from the coronavirus in Georgia has risen sharply.\n\nThirty-five more Georgians have died since Monday night, according to the latest data from the Georgia Department of Public Health. Those deaths follow the 75 reported Monday to contribute to a statewide total of 329 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel virus.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there are 8,818 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, an increase of more than 1,000, or about 17%, from the figures health officials reported the night before. Of those who have tested positive, 1,774 have been hospitalized since the coronavirus pandemic entered Georgia, officials said.\n\nAdditional growth in number of cases, deaths and hospitalizations is expected when the Department of Public Health releases its next update at 7 p.m.\n\n\u00bb COMPLETE COVERAGE: Coronavirus in Georgia\n\nHealth officials say the number of infections still does not adequately reflect the severity of the coronavirus crisis in Georgia, as a limited supply of tests remain rationed for the most vulnerable. A partnership between universities and state agencies announced last week could improve testing capabilities, although it is unclear when tests might be made widely available to the public.\n\nSince Monday night, commercial and state laboratories have conducted 2,439 additional tests.\n\n\u00bb RELATED: Rapid virus tests come to Atlanta as testing slowly ramps up\n\nWith increased testing and rapid spread of the virus, numbers are expected to surge in the coming weeks. One widely cited model by the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicts that Georgia\u2019s daily death toll could peak April 21. By then, the model shows an additional 1,500 Georgians could die from COVID-19.\n\n\u00bb AJC IN-DEPTH: 75 more deaths in a day: Georgia enters devastating phase of outbreak\n\n\u00bb MORE: Flu hits rural Georgia hard, data shows. Will COVID-19 do the same?\n\nHancock is now among the 155 counties in Georgia with a known case. Only four \u2014 Evans, Glascock, Montgomery and Taliaferro counties \u2014 have no confirmed cases as of Tuesday.\n\n\n\nIn metro Atlanta, there are 1,124 cases of the virus in Fulton County, 645 in DeKalb, 550 in Cobb, 525 in Gwinnett, 266 in Clayton, 196 in Hall, 194 in Henry, 187 in Bartow, 177 in Carroll, 144 in Cherokee, 111 in Douglas, 85 in Rockdale, 65 in Newton and 60 in Paulding.\n\nDougherty County in southwest Georgia reported the largest increases Tuesday, with 217 new infections and eight more deaths for a total of 52. The county is home to Albany and has become a hot spot of the epidemic in Georgia. Neighboring counties Sumter, Terrell and Lee also saw a big spike in numbers Tuesday. Sumter and Terrell, which both have populations of about 30,000, saw cases increase by the dozens.\n\nMuch smaller Lee County, which is home to about 8,500 people, kept pace. Officials in Lee reported 47 new infections and two more deaths since Monday night, bringing the county\u2019s death toll to 15.\n\nCoffee, Greene, Pierce, Tift and Brantley each reported their first death Tuesday. Thirty-six deaths, including four more since Monday night, have been reported in Fulton County alone.\n\nOf the deaths statewide, about 54% had underlying conditions and 82% were age 60 or older, according to health officials.

Other than trips to buy food, seek medical care, work in critical jobs or exercise outdoors, Georgians are urged to stay indoors to help curb new infections.\n\nThe order is in force through at least April 13. Gov. Brian Kemp also ordered the closure of all public schools through the end of the academic year.\n\nThose who believe they are experiencing symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19 are asked to contact their primary care doctor or an urgent care clinic.

Brian Kemp announced this week the purchase of scarce supplies and equipment needed to vastly expand the state\u2019s capacity to process tests for the coronavirus. But the state still has a long way to go to catch up with the rest of the nation.\n\nAn Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis of testing data shows Georgia near the bottom for testing per capita. This is despite ranking 11th, as of midday Wednesday, for total confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and seventh in overall deaths.\n\nOn Tuesday, Kemp also announced a partnership between the state, the University System of Georgia and Emory University. In the days ahead, the governor\u2019s office said, the state\u2019s public health lab and labs at Augusta University, Emory and Georgia State will be capable of processing 3,000 coronavirus tests per day.\n\nAt that rate, the facilities will be able to process more tests per week for Georgia patients than the total number of tests performed since the first cases were confirmed in the state in early March.\n\nKemp said at a Wednesday press conference that \u201cexpanding testing remains a top priority for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all know that the status quo is unacceptable, and I certainly appreciate their innovation,\u201d Kemp said of the partnership. \u201cWe will continue to innovate and push so all Georgians who need a test for COVID-19 can do so in a safe and convenient way.\u201d\n\nAs of noon Wednesday, the state\u2019s public health lab and commercial labs combined had processed 20,326 tests of Georgians, up 25 percent from 16,181 only 24 hours earlier. The increase reflected reports by additional labs and improved electronic reporting, according to the state.\n\nStill, the AJC analysis of national testing data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project found Georgia ranked 41st per capita in testing as of noon Wednesday.\n\nMinnesota, with roughly half of Georgia\u2019s 10.6 million population, has processed about the same number of tests as the Peach State. Smaller states \u2014 including Louisiana, Massachusetts and New Jersey \u2014 had processed about twice as many or more.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp speaks during a press conference at Liberty Plaza, across the street from the Georgia State Capitol building, in downtown Atlanta, Wednesday. During the presser, Gov. Kemp ordered all Georgia K-12 schools to be closed until the end of the academic school year. He also said he will sign an order on Thursday forcing a \u201cStay-at-home\u201d order for all Georgians until April 13. (ALYSSA POINTER \/ ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nTesting in Georgia has grown in recent weeks. The state and hospital groups have established drive-through testing in about two dozen locations. But testing remains available mostly for only the very sick, those who live in group setting such as nursing homes, and emergency and health workers.\n\nIn a news conference Wednesday, Kemp and Dr. Kathleen Toomey, the state\u2019s commissioner of public health, stopped short of saying when restrictions on testing might be loosened.\n\nThe new state processing capacity will ramp up total tests administered and return results faster. Lessening the lag time for results will give officials a clearer picture of the virus\u2019 spread.\n\nPublic health experts welcomed the state\u2019s new test processing capacity. But they said far more Georgians need to be tested to understand the scope of the outbreak.\n\n\u201cWe continue to hear from the governor and public health commissioner that we\u2019re making our decisions based on data, and I continue to scream that we don\u2019t have adequate data to guide us in the way we need to be guided,\u201d said Dr. Harry J. Heiman, a clinical associate professor at the Georgia State School of Public Health.\n\nKemp said he will sign an executive order to take effect Friday instructing Georgians to shelter-in-place through April 13.\n\nToomey said confirmed cases will rise as testing expands. But community mitigation, including sheltering-in-place, are vital to curb the spread.\n\n\u201cEven as we expand testing more broadly, as more testing becomes available, we can\u2019t test our way out of this crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to take the community mitigation measures that have been proposed now.\u201d\n\n\u2018A national problem\u2019\n\nThe COVID-19 data released by the state twice a day is typically days old, showing a snapshot of where the virus was then \u2014 not now.\n\nThe Atlantic magazine reported Wednesday that national labs such as Quest and LabCorp are swamped with pending tests and haven\u2019t been able to scale up fast enough to meet demand. Local Georgia labs, meanwhile, have capacity to process tests, but have been stymied by red tape and shortages in supplies.\n\nKemp and top Georgia hospitals have urged people with mild to moderate symptoms not to seek tests and to ride out their illnesses in isolation at home. That was, in part, to preserve testing supplies and prevent the spread of COVID-19. That advice appears likely to remain in place, at least for now.\n\nDr. Kathleen Toomey, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health, answers questions from the media during a press conference at Liberty Plaza, across the street from the Georgia State Capitol building, in downtown Atlanta, Wednesday. (ALYSSA POINTER \/ ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nKemp said though test availability is improving, \u201cour capacity has been limited due to the number of reliable and available tests.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs many of you have reported, competition among states for access to commercial labs is obviously at an all-time high,\u201d he said.\n\nBut all states are confronting similar issues. The AJC analysis shows that on a per capita basis, Georgia lags all but 10 states and Puerto Rico.\n\nDr. Carlos Del Rio, an Emory epidemiologist, said the state\u2019s processing expansion shows Kemp is making testing a priority.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s listening to public health (experts), and he\u2019s doing the right thing,\u201d Del Rio said.\n\nBut Del Rio said now is not the time for healthy people anxious about the disease to seek tests as the state works to clear its backlog of pending tests.\n\nDel Rio said South Korea leads the world in testing on a per capita basis at about 1 percent of its population. The U.S., by contrast, has tested a little more than 1 million of its 330 million, or about one-third of 1 percent of the population.\n\nAfter a slow start, testing has grown in the U.S., where more total tests have been performed overall than in any other nation.\n\n\u201cThis is a national problem. It\u2019s not just a Georgia problem,\u201d Del Rio said.\n\nVirus moves quickly\n\nHeiman, the Georgia State professor, said Georgia ranks near the bottom in health outcomes and risks nationwide. Chronic conditions that are more common in Georgia than most states \u2014 such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease \u2014 make more Georgians vulnerable to COVID-19.\n\nA rampant outbreak of COVID-19 has made the Albany area one of the hardest hit places in the world, per capita. Dougherty County, home to Albany, ranks near the bottom of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties in health outcomes, Heiman said.\n\n\u201cYou see what happens when you introduce a virus to a population that\u2019s already at high risk,\u201d Heiman said. \u201cIt moves very, very quickly and in devastating ways.\u201d\n\nHeiman said cases of COVID-19 are spreading to poor and rural counties with limited testing and health care capacity. That\u2019s why expanding testing, including more drive-through facilities, is vital, he said, to understand the penetration of the disease.\n\n\u201cIn counties with one case, these cases don\u2019t happen in isolation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have one case, you have many, many others and I suspect we may have many more explosions on the horizon.\u201d\n\nSupport real journalism.

And Positive results could even be delivered in as little as five minutes, CVS said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIncreased access to rapid testing remains one of our top priorities in order to identify more cases, get Georgians the care they need, and prevent further infection in our communities,\u201d Kemp said.\n\nAt full capacity, the site will be able to conduct up to 1,000 tests per day.\n\n\u201cIt will help us get a better sense of how widespread the virus is in the community,\u201d said Dr. Marybeth Sexton, an infectious disease expert at the Emory University School of Medicine.\n\nEmmanuel Kolady, senior vice president at CVS Health, said the company was eager to help in the public health crisis.\n\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re one of the largest health care companies in the country and we believe we play an important role in dealing with this pandemic and we believe it\u2019s our duty to step up and assist the local, state and the federal government in providing solutions,\u201d Kolady said.\n\nPatients must pre-register in advance for a same-day appointment online at www.CVS.com\/minuteclinic\/covid-19-testing.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause severe and even life-threatening illness.\n\nElsewhere, President Donald Trump was asked Monday about Kemp\u2019s decision to reopen the state\u2019s beaches. Georgia\u2019s governor had said people weathering the coronavirus outbreak need fresh air and exercise.\n\nKemp also noted Sunday on Twitter that state law enforcement officers were monitoring beaches at Tybee Island and elsewhere to ensure crowds weren\u2019t gathering, and that beach traffic appeared sparse. Kemp said, \u201cBeach gear and parties are prohibited.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatrols are vigilant so people can get fresh air and exercise while following social distancing rules,\u201d the governor tweeted.\n\nAt his daily news conference on the pandemic, Trump was asked about Kemp\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen -- I\u2019m going to have to see to what extent,\u201d Trump said of the matter. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to see how many people you\u2019re talking about. Are they crowded, are they packed, are they not packed? We\u2019ll have to take a look at it. Right now, it\u2019s very early for beaches in Georgia. So right now, very early. So I\u2019ll take a look at it.\u201d\n\nTrump said Kemp has done a good job as governor: \u201cHe knows what he\u2019s doing, we\u2019ll have to take a look. It really does depend on, you know, how crowded it may be. But I will talk to him and I will ask him that question I would ask him. Yeah, please.\u201d\n\nEarlier Monday, in hard-hit Dougherty County, officials said they were seeing some glimmer of optimism. The number of coronavirus tests conducted at a drive-thru site at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany was just 46 on Sunday, a sharp drop for a site that had been taking 150 or more test samples daily, said Chris Cohilas, chairman of the Dougherty County Commission.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know yet if that is statistically remarkable,\u201d Cohilas said at a news conference. \u201cBut to me as a person who is looking at these numbers each and every day ... for us to experience a day where we only tested 46 yesterday; that\u2019s encouraging.\u201d\n\nScott Steiner, CEO of Phoebe Putney Health System, said the Albany hospital Monday had 136 patients with COVID-19 or presumed infected, and that all intensive care beds at the hospital remained full. But he said 77 virus patients have been discharged since Wednesday, and five others have been taken off ventilators and are breathing on their own.","tests":"['1,000 tests', '31,274 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

What he has never done is decide who will live \u2014 and who won\u2019t. Now, looking at the damage from the spreading coronavirus, he\u2019s afraid he might have to.\n\nThe last line of defense for some of the most serious COVID-19 patients are ventilators, the machines that keep people breathing when they can\u2019t do that for themselves. And for what\u2019s coming, there aren\u2019t enough.\n\nGeorgia has perhaps 2,400 to 3,000 on hand. When the outbreak peaks later this month, it will place a tremendous strain on the state\u2019s supply of ventilators, computer models show. With the supply now on hand, hospitals in Fulton County could fall short by the beginning of next week, emergency management officials warned Wednesday. In the worst case, the Fulton hospitals could be short more than 100.\n\n\u00bb COMPLETE COVERAGE: Coronavirus in Georgia\n\n\u00bb MORE: Coronavirus and Georgia hospitals\n\n\n\nThat raises the wrenching possibility that in the near future, a care team will be faced with one available ventilator and more than one patient who needs it \u2014 and the team will have to choose.\n\nGeorgia isn\u2019t yet at that point, and all concerned hope it never will be. But hospital officials and some of the bioethicists who advise them on end-of-life decisions are already drawing up guidance for such decisions. They consider if or when age should be a factor. The likelihood of full recovery. Certainly not wealth or prominence, but what about contributions someone has made to society? Or should it be first come, first served?\n\nA group of doctors writing in the New England Journal of Medicine last week suggested that for patients with similar prospects, a lottery was the only fair way to decide.\n\nAs they wait for guidance, Georgia doctors have asked Gov. Brian Kemp for protection from liability if they have to deny someone a ventilator. And family members and mental health professionals are bracing for the mental fallout among health care workers if they have to make such choices.\n\nA Fulton County presentation Wednesday showed the county\u2019s need for ventilators in the coronavirus pandemic would outstrip the supply even in the best case. (Screenshot via Fulton County) Photo: The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\n\nDr. Ann Groover, a psychiatrist in Rome, has already seen health care workers in her office in tears at dealing with the outbreak there: frazzled and exhausted at the work they\u2019ve done, and still racked by wondering if they could have done more. To actively decide not to do more for a patient \u2014 or at least to feel like it was your decision \u2014 could be devastating for some, she said.\n\nIf it comes to rationing ventilators, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be awful,\u201d she said. \u201cDoctors are going to feel like they\u2019re killing patients instead of saving them. And it\u2019s a very unfair situation to put physicians in.\n\n\u201cBut we haven\u2019t ever faced a crisis like this as a nation. And many many people are facing situations that they are going to find extremely hard to live with going forward.\u201d\n\nPlanning ahead\n\nA week ago, the Georgia-based Healthcare Ethics Consortium, started posting guidance on its website for hospitals and doctors trying to figure out how to approach the issue. One of the most detailed documents is a draft for Emory Healthcare, where Kathy Kinlaw, the consortium\u2019s director, also works.\n\nThat guidance has some signal principles. First and foremost, each patient\u2019s chances for the ventilator should be evaluated based on medical scores indicating whether they are likely to survive. Only if choosing between patients of similar health, it says, does age become a possible, second-tier consideration. In that case, clinicians may take into consideration \u201csupport for an equal opportunity to live through the various phases of life.\u201d\n\n\u00bb RELATED: Hospitals, state scramble to prepare for coronavirus surge\n\n\u00bb MORE: Hospital works to support rattled health care workers\n\nAnother principle is not to write off a class of people, such as the disabled. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a bulletin this weekend reminding hospitals it would enforce federal protections from discrimination based on age, disability, national origin or similar factors.\n\nHospitals should also draw up guidelines well before hand, as an institution, so that doctors don\u2019t feel they\u2019re making decisions alone or on the fly, the draft recommends. Connected to that is the recommendation that the patient-by-patient decisions be made not by the patient\u2019s own doctor, but by a designated team at the hospital.\n\nThe patient and their family should have input. But they don\u2019t make the final call.\n\nKinlaw advocates for transparency not just with the patient and their family but with the public; and from the very beginning, long before such decisions are on a patient\u2019s doorstep.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t ever faced a crisis like this as a nation. And many many people are facing situations that they are going to find extremely hard to live with going forward.\u201d \u2014Dr. Ann Groover, a psychiatrist in Rome\n\nThe medical journal article says patients should be made aware of the possibility of rationing at admission.\n\nEmory\u2019s drafted guidance doesn\u2019t pretend that a ventilator shortage is impossible, and it is blunt about what is at stake. In a crisis shortage, Emory\u2019s draft guidance reads, \u201cIt is unavoidable that not all who desire ventilation will receive it.\u201d\n\nSy said that at his hospital, Memorial Hospital in Savannah, medical workers had started to have conversations, and he was eager to read the draft by Emory and others.\n\nFaced with an 85 year old and an 18 year old in similar respiratory condition, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say, \u2018oh well you only have one open ventilator and there\u2019s one 18 year old and one 85 year old\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m the one that\u2019s going to have the conversation with the 85-year-old\u2019s family and let them know.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would challenge the mental well being of physicians to essentially have to give out death sentences, to have to make decisions to not put someone on a ventilator or take someone off a ventilator that might need it if there are not enough ventilators,\u201d he added. \u201cThe first thing you learn is, do no harm. There\u2019s no training in medical school on how to ration out medical care in the U.S.\u201d\n\nShifting resources?\n\nThese agonizing decisions could be avoided if enough ventilators can get to the hospitals that need them.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday said it had put in orders to increase the national stockpile by 20,000 ventilators. But they won\u2019t arrive until a month after the outbreak peak is expected to be past in Georgia.\n\n\u00bb RELATED: As virus spreads, a growing fear of overwhelmed Georgia hospitals\n\n\u00bb MORE: Health care workers in harm\u2019s way in coronavirus battle\n\nThe department also suggested that a state transfer equipment from regions not experiencing outbreaks to those that are. But hospital professionals said that transferring equipment is not workable, because any hospital that loses ventilators to a growing surge knows they\u2019re not coming back, even if they are hit by a surge of their own. And when a patient arrives needing ventilation, there\u2019s no time to get it back anyway. Physicians have described COVID-19 patients going into a dire state unexpectedly fast and needing ventilation.\n\nAnother suggestions was to use one ventilator for two patients, but only as \u201can absolute last resort.\u201d Doing that can have adverse health effects, including infections and damage to patients\u2019 lungs.\n\nAt his press briefing Tuesday evening, President Trump said the federal government had distributed some ventilators to needed areas, and was holding on to about 10,000 of the machines in order to more quickly deploy them to needed areas.\n\nDr. Henry Siegelson practices emergency medicine in Atlanta. In his three decades as a physician, he said never before have short supplies forced him to decide who lives and who dies. He\u2019s frustrated there hasn\u2019t been more planning.\n\n\u201cWe talk about it all the time,\u201d Siegelson said. \u201cSome people will get ventilators and some people won\u2019t. It\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\nSupport real journalism. Support local journalism. Subscribe to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution today.

Then the Governor\u2019s Shelter-in-Place Came Along.","text":"For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis and more, subscribe to Mother Jones' newsletters\n\nLate last week, my Georgia friends and I rejoiced: Our governor, Brian Kemp, had finally issued a statewide shelter-in-place order to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nIt was about time: A terrifying New York Times map showed that people in the Southeast hadn\u2019t been staying home. Atlanta\u2019s hospitals are now preparing for a \u201csuper surge\u201d of COVID-19 patients. In Albany, a small city about 3 hours southwest of Atlanta, a single funeral spread the virus to more than 500 people. The local hospital has a total of 14 ICU beds.\n\nAt the press conference where he unveiled the order, Kemp said what all of us had been hoping he would finally say: Georgia can \u201cwin this war by hunkering down.\u201d\n\nBut our relief was short-lived. On Friday night, just as the shelter-in-place was to take effect, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported that under Kemp\u2019s order, Georgia\u2019s beaches, which had been closed by mayors in the coastal cities, had reopened. The statewide shelter-in-place mandated that beaches open for people seeking exercise\u2014and the order superseded the local ordinances.\n\n\u201cKemp\u2019s Shelter-in-Place order, by virtue of how it nullifies all local emergency ordinances, is clearly an attempt to walk back more stringent and conflicting local orders.\u201d\n\nLike clockwork, on Saturday morning, the Savannah Morning News reported that beaches in the town of Tybee Island were filling up. Photos accompanying the piece showed people playing games on the beach, groups of a dozen or so people wading in the water, and crowds on the boardwalk. Saturday evening, the paper reported, a Tybee Island police officer tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLocal leaders were livid. Later on Saturday, Tybee Island mayor Shirley Sessions closed beach parking lots and access points. Those small steps were all that the governor\u2019s order allowed. Kemp, she told the Savannah Morning News, \u201cholds all the cards. We hold none.\u201d\n\nThe news about Georgia\u2019s beaches reopening went national. But it wasn\u2019t just Georgia\u2019s coastal leaders who felt undermined by the loopholes in Kemp\u2019s shelter-in-place. Late Friday evening, I got an email from Georgia state senator Sally Harrell, a Democrat who represents the suburbs just north of Atlanta in Georgia\u2019s senate district 40. Georgia mayors, she told me, were dismayed to find that Kemp\u2019s order undid the local social-distancing measures that they had worked hard to put in place. They learned, for example, that Kemp\u2019s order prohibited local police from breaking up gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, I spoke with Stephe Koontz, a member of the city council of the suburb of Doraville. Kemp\u2019s order, she said, \u201ckind of threw our community into chaos. There\u2019s been a lot of mixed messages because people are saying, \u2018Well, I read the governor\u2019s order and we know police can\u2019t do anything right now, so we\u2019re going to go ahead and have a party.\u2019\u201d\n\nKoontz pointed out that most of the time, in Georgia, statewide laws are meant to serve as a baseline\u2014if local communities want to make stricter rules, they\u2019re free to do so. But Kemp\u2019s shelter-in-place, said Koontz, is different: It forbids local leaders from enacting stricter social distancing laws. \u201cIn Georgia, usually the state law becomes the floor of the regulation, and in most cases the cities are allowed to be more restrictive,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what he did.\u201d\n\nSen. Harrell believes that Kemp\u2019s shelter-in-place is a sneaky way of relaxing what the governor sees as local overreach. \u201cGovernor Kemp was very clear in delaying his own action, that he wanted local communities to take the lead\u2014and they did,\u201d she wrote to me in an email. \u201cThen he came along and undid what they had done.\u201d She added: \u201cKemp\u2019s Shelter-in-Place order, by virtue of how it nullifies all local emergency ordinances, is clearly an attempt to walk back more stringent and conflicting local orders.\u201d\n\nIndeed, before Kemp announced his shelter-in-place, his office criticized local leaders\u2019 social-distancing rules. Last week, Tim Fleming, Kemp\u2019s chief of staff, wrote in a now-deleted Facebook post, \u201cThe media and some in the medical profession are peddling these doomsday models and projections. This has in turn resulted in people panicking and local governments across our state overreacting. As a result of their overreach, many small business will struggle, and some will not reopen.\u201d\n\nKoontz, too, said she wondered about Kemp\u2019s motives. \u201cIt almost feels like what came down from the governor was a partisan move,\u201d she said. \u201cThis feels like it might have been a middle finger to metro Atlanta\u2019s stricter ordinances.\u201d\n\nIndeed. In my Atlanta neighborhood, I walk my kids past our neighborhood park most days. My four-year-old now knows that we can\u2019t go play\u2014\u201cthe playground is closed,\u201d he says. Since Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms issued her stay-at-home order for the city of Atlanta a little more than two weeks ago, the park has been relatively empty. But on Sunday, I noticed a group of teenagers chasing each other around on the playground equipment. I hustled my son in the opposite direction, so I wouldn\u2019t have to explain to him that no one was going to make them leave.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['14 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

Wanda V\u00e1zquez acknowledged that the island had ordered the tests worth $38 million and was asking for a full refund of its 50% deposit. V\u00e1zquez blamed a previous secretary of health for making the flawed order.\n\nBut the allegations that the companies have political and financial ties to her New Progressive Party (PNP) could weigh on her efforts to win reelection in November.\n\nThe status of Puerto Rico\u2019s COVID-19 testing has been shrouded in doubt since officials announced their first suspected case on March 8. Shortly after, V\u00e1zquez said the island had ordered 200,000 rapid test kits, but officials failed to provide additional information about that contract.\n\nLast week, newly appointed Health Secretary Lorenzo Gonz\u00e1lez told CBS television those tests had not received approval from the federal government and might never be received. Hours later, however, he said they had been approved and were on their way.\n\nOn Monday, Gonz\u00e1lez told Radio Isla those tests were on the island and that an additional 7,000 tests had arrived on Friday.\n\nAlmost a month into the health crisis, the Puerto Rico Health Department has run 4,951 tests across the U.S. territory of 3.2 million people. That\u2019s lower than the per capita testing rate of any U.S. state but Oklahoma, according to data pulled from the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nOn Monday, Gonz\u00e1lez refrained from saying who had made the order but he said a large number of tests are still needed. In a nationally televised conference of Puerto Rico\u2019s COVID-19 Task Force, he said the Health Department would no longer use intermediaries but order directly from manufacturers, \u201cso we don\u2019t create any more inconveniences.\u201d\n\nThe Federal Oversight Management Board \u2014 a federally appointed body that oversees Puerto Rico\u2019s finances \u2014 said the contracts appeared to have been made \u201cwithout consideration of applicable processes or of basic procurement good practices\u201d and were, therefore, \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther, a legal analysis of the agreements in question may conclude that the same are null and void from inception,\u201d the board said in a statement. \u201cAs such, these agreements should be canceled, provided they have not been already, and you should seek immediate reimbursement of all public funds disbursed in connection thereto.\u201d\n\nThe testing woes come as the island is doubling down on its social-distancing rules. Puerto Rico has been under a mandatory quarantine and all non-essential businesses have been closed since March 16. That measure, which has already been extended once, is slated to run through April 12. But health officials say the island won\u2019t hit the peak of the outbreak until sometime between April 15 and May 8, making another extension likely.\n\nOn Sunday, V\u00e1zquez said that all businesses except pharmacies and gas stations would be closed Friday through Sunday, using the Easter holiday to tighten the stay-at-home order.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has sued the government, saying the executive order, which imposes fines and jail sentences for violating curfews, is unconstitutional.\n\nBut the draconian shutdown has received positive reviews in medical circles. Dr. Marina Del Rios, an Associate Professor at the Department of Emergency Medicine with the University of Illinois in Chicago, said the island was right to move early and forcefully against the coronavirus.\n\nRios is also a member of the \u201cDoctoras Boricuas\u201d \u2014 a group of Puerto Rican medical professionals who work as informal advocates for the island.\n\n\u201cYou can criticize the government of Puerto Rico for many things but [V\u00e1zquez] did this right,\u201d Rios said of the lockdown order. \u201cThat could be the saving grace of Puerto Rico.\u201d\n\nThe fact that it\u2019s an island makes the measure even more effective. On the U.S. mainland, the uneven state and municipal responses to the coronavirus could potentially weaken any measure taken.\n\nWhile Illinois has taken strict measures to ensure social distancing, neighboring Missouri hasn\u2019t, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a section of the pool being the peeing section,\u201d she said. \u201cEventually it will make it to the other side.\u201d\n\nIf the island does see an uncontrolled surge in COVID-19 cases it could be in trouble.\n\nFor the the majority of people affected by the coronavirus it produces nothing but mild, flu-like symptoms. But for a significant minority \u2014 particularly the elderly and those with preexisting conditions \u2014 it can cause respiratory problems. And in extreme cases, ventilators are required to keep patients alive.\n\nHealth officials say there are about 500 functioning ventilators on the island and it could need up to 3,000 if the cases spike.\n\nPuerto Rico has been hounded by perceptions of corruption and incompetence. During a rash of earthquakes earlier this year, citizens discovered an underutilized warehouse of first aid supplies, many of which had expired.\n\nSince Gonz\u00e1lez, the health secretary, assumed the position on March 26, he said he\u2019s found at least two stockpiles of expired medicine and medical equipment worth millions of dollars. On Monday he said that U.S. law enforcement may be investigating those cases.\n\nPedro Pierluisi, who is running against V\u00e1zquez in the PNP primary, said that she must investigate the purchase and reform the island\u2019s contracting procedures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unforgivable that, in the middle of an emergency, that the government is buying COVID-19 tests from people who are selling them at inflated prices and with no guarantees,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBeyond the negligence and possible misappropriation of public funds, this weakens the image of the government in the eyes of our people, and we already see that the federal authorities are investigating.\u201d","tests":"['7,000 tests', '4,951 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The American Civil Liberties Union has asked for an injunction of the executive order that created the quarantine and curfew, arguing it\u2019s unconstitutional.\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Wanda V\u00e1zquez assumed even more sweeping powers, signing an amendment to the Public Security law that makes breaking the curfew \u2014 or future curfews \u2014 punishable with six months in jail and\/or a $5,000 fine. In addition, it makes it illegal for media outlets or social media accounts \u201cto transmit or allow the transmission\u201d of \u201cfalse information with the intention of creating confusion, panic, or public hysteria, with regards to any proclamation or executive order declaring an emergency, disaster or curfew.\u201d\n\nIf the false information causes more than $10,000 in damage to public-sector finances or leads to injury or damage of physical property, it will be considered a fourth-degree criminal offense, the governor\u2019s office said.\n\nLu\u00eds Davila-Col\u00f3n, a prominent radio host and author, accused the governor of drifting into authoritarianism.\n\n\u201cYou cannot govern through dictatorial decrees, scolding, secrets, muzzling, blockades or threatening to imprison your subjects,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cYou govern through leadership, care, and with measures to protect, not oppress.\u201d\n\nBut V\u00e1zquez argues the move is necessary as some people are still not complying with the stay-at-home order. Since the quarantine went into place, at least 275 people have been arrested and 482 people have been cited or charged.\n\n\u201cThat number is unacceptable and even more so when it risks the health and security of our people,\u201d V\u00e1zquez said in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, Puerto Rico\u2019s Chamber of Commerce also questioned the governor\u2019s decision to close all establishments except pharmacies and gasoline stations from Friday through Sunday \u2014 using the Easter Holiday to further tighten social-distancing orders.\n\nChamber President Jos\u00e9 E.

This is not sufficient because people can spread the disease before they display symptoms, and these would not be caught by such a screening. Also the screening requirement applies only to people who arrive on cruise ships.\n\nThe US commonwealth of Puerto Rico will face a major crisis if it cannot contain a Covid-19 outbreak when it arrives. And it will arrive soon, if it hasn\u2019t already. A cruise ship passenger diagnosed with pneumonia was admitted to a San Juan hospital and isolated while waiting the results of a coronavirus test. Meanwhile, her fellow passengers visited the city\u2019s sights, restaurants, and bars. In addition, a doctor from Panama visited the island March 4 for a salsa festival in spite of showing symptoms, and has now been diagnosed with the disease.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat Puerto Rico needs, urgently, is to test people for the presence of the virus itself. However, as of today, its testing ability for Covid-19 is still listed as \u201cin progress\u201d on the CDC website. The fact that the entire US mainland is still not testing people sufficiently, which means we are potentially missing thousands of cases, makes it even harder for Puerto Rico to assess its risk of importing infections from travelers. And without knowing if community transmission has taken hold on the island already, Puerto Rico will scramble to respond if and when it does.\n\nAs a population, Puerto Rico is at greater risk of sickness and death compared to the mainland United States. The severity of Covid-19 increases sharply in elderly people, with estimates from China suggesting mortality among people who have the infection around one in 12 for people ages 70 to 80, and one in seven for people over 80. According to the Census, Puerto Rico has a higher proportion of elderly people compared to most places in the United States \u2014 21 percent over 65 Puerto Rico in 2017 compared to 16 percent in the rest of the United States. In addition, Puerto Rican elderly residents are seven times as likely to live in poverty compared to the rest of the country. If we look at hospital preparedness, and consider one metric of our readiness to care for patients with Covid-19 \u2014 intensive care unit beds \u2014 Puerto Rico has five times fewer ICU beds per capita compared to the rest of the country.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese numbers are sobering, but they underestimate the enormity of the challenges facing Puerto Rico. In 2017, Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and much of the island is still recovering. Since then, many younger Puerto Ricans moved off the island, and by 2018 about 15 percent of the island\u2019s medical specialists had left too. These departures left behind weakened infrastructure, fewer low-risk age groups, and medical staff to help keep things running during a crisis, and many elderly people who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. To be clear, this epidemic will not only impact people who get this virus \u2014 many of whom will end up spending a significant amount of time in the hospital. It will also critically stress the health system to the point where those with other health issues \u2014 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer \u2014 may not be able to access essential care and medication. A widespread outbreak would raise mortality across the board for medically vulnerable groups.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the grave risks facing its people, Puerto Rico has two strengths in this fight that set it apart from the rest of the United States. First, it is an island. Unless community transmission has already begun, which is possible, then immediate travel restrictions could be effective at keeping the virus out. The economic costs of doing so would be significant, but they pale in comparison to the devastation an outbreak would bring to Puerto Rico\u2019s people and health system.\n\nSecond, Puerto Rico has a large pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity. The island was once a top drug-making center, but drug makers largely left after tax breaks ended in 2006. China currently accounts for the vast majority of precursor chemicals for US drugs, and there may be shortages of the chemical components of the Covid-19 test kits. Aside from the possibility of immediate ramping up of production of reagents and ICU drugs to control this outbreak and mitigate its impacts, there is a longer-term strategic rationale for bringing much of the historic pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the island.\n\nPuerto Rico is vulnerable. It, with assistance from the federal government, must establish surveillance, determine whether there is community transmission, and prepare its health system immediately.\n\nCaroline Buckee is associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health TH Chan School of Public Health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave a point of view about this?

Padilla Rosas\n\nFrom Eugene, Oregon\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic poses a great challenge to countries with high levels of poverty, limited medical infrastructure, and a lack of universal access to health care. So far, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Puerto Rico is 286 and 11 deaths. [1] Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, does not fare much better in terms of public access to health care services than most underdeveloped countries. To make things worse, in the three years prior to the novel coronavirus pandemic there had been a reduction in public access to the government health care system. Eligibility requirements for the federal health plan began to be more rigorous in 2017 due to irregularities found in the status of nearly 30,000 patients who had acquired help from the Medicaid system without being eligible for it. At this time eligibility for the program is directed at patients who receive a net income of no more than $800 per month.[2] With such a low income threshold, only half of the citizens living below the poverty level in Puerto Rico are eligible for coverage. Since 60% of the population lives below the poverty level, the eligibility requirements exclude many Puerto Ricans who cannot afford private health insurance.[3] In addition to these obstacles with regard to access to healthcare, the Puerto Rican archipelago\u2019s health system now suffers from the lack of reliable leadership with the dismissal of Health Department Secretary Rafael Rodr\u00edguez Mercado on March 13, 2020. [4]\n\nThe socio-economic conditions\n\nThe unemployment is also taking a heavy toll on Puerto Ricans. By January 2020, nearly 94,000 Puerto Rican citizens were already unemployed. This figure represented an increase of 2,000 unemployed compared to January 2019.[5] Between March 16 and March 30, some 76,928 Puerto Ricans applied for unemployment benefits; that\u2019s not counting those who have not yet had access to the Internet or someone to help them with the application process. [6] To date, unemployment claims in the Puerto Rican archipelago have reached more than 100,000.[7]\n\nFortunately, last week Puerto Rico approved an unprecedented financial package of $787 million to blunt the economic blow caused by the pandemic. Democracy Now reports:\n\n\u201cMeasures include a three-month moratorium on mortgage payments, as well as other loans; bonuses for essential services providers such as medical staff and police; and improving remote education by buying tablets and educational tools. Governor Wanda V\u00e1zquez also said Puerto Rico\u2019s public sector employees will keep getting paid, and small businesses and self-employed workers will receive cash to cope with the crisis.\u201d [8]\n\nGiven the limited public access to health care services and high poverty and unemployment rates, this minimal relief is urgently needed. It is in the face of these economic challenges and deficits in the health care system in Puerto Rico that the Governor took swift action aimed at fighting the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe historical-political context of the Governor\u2019s response\n\nAfter the events of the summer of 2019, when Puerto Rico\u2019s citizens demanded the resignation of former Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 Nevares, the political atmosphere in Puerto Rico has fallen short of robust democratic participation.[9] The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico provides that when there is a vacancy in the office of Governor, the Secretary of State becomes the Governor. However, this position was left vacant before Rossell\u00f3 resigned. Therefore, the line of succession fell under the responsibility of the Secretary of the Department of Justice, Wanda V\u00e1zquez Garced, the current Governor of Puerto Rico. Although V\u00e1zquez was not elected democratically by the people of Puerto Rico, she is constitutionally the governor. As such, she has taken the lead in addressing the responsibility to take political action on the pandemic and has a measure of democratic legitimacy.\n\nGovernor Wanda V\u00e1zquez declared a curfew on March 15, 2020 to be effective that same day from 9:00 p.m. until March 30, and this order has now been extended until April 12. [10] Among the directives included in the governor\u2019s executive order, cars with license plates ending in even numbers will only be allowed to travel on the streets on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On the other hand, the license plates of cars ending in odd numbers may be used on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. On Sundays, grocery stores and supermarkets will be closed. Citizens may leave their homes only to buy food or go to the pharmacy, financial institutions, gas stations, and health centers such as hospitals, with the exception of dental offices. Citizens are allowed to be out of the home with justifiable reasons from 5:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Those companies and public services whose tasks involve the health and safety of citizens may continue to operate. This category includes police officers, messengers, car mechanics, gas stations, telecommunications services, and other functions essential for the proper functioning of a quarantined society.\n\nAlthough stopping the entry of the virus into Puerto Rico has not been possible, this unincorporated territory of the United States was among the first countries in the Americas to take rigorous measures to control the spread of the virus. [11] The implementation of such measures in some cases required cooperation of US government authorities. For example, because Puerto Rico\u2019s airports operate under the authority of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the governor had to draft a petition to the federal government to have flights restricted to the island. As a result of this intervention, only one of the island\u2019s three main airports is currently providing domestic flights, though the petition proposed closing the airports for all domestic flights for at least 14 days.\n\nPreparing for an increase in COVID-19 cases\n\nA nurse from the Mayaguez region who prefers to remain anonymous told the author that at the moment, there are enough hospital beds to deal with the limited number of cases. However, this time \u201cno hospital has the capacity to receive a massive influx of patients under the appropriate isolation protocols.\u201d Regarding the safety equipment needed by health care professionals to care for coronavirus patients, he states that \u201cprotective equipment is scarce and the administration of each hospital keeps it restricted as needed. I have not been denied any equipment at this time, but I personally recognize my rights and the regulations that protect me as a nurse and those that protect patients.\u201d\n\nTo date, there has been no reported lack of beds to treat patients in hospitals. According to Dr. Juan Salgado, member of the Interagency state medical group, \u201cPuerto Rico has 6,000 hospital beds and an estimated 60%, that is to say 3,600 beds, are available to receive patients\u201d [as of March 28]. However, if COVID-19 infections in Puerto Rico continue at the same rate of growth, in three weeks there will not be enough available in the archipelago\u2019s hospitals to treat patients.[12] In any case, the Puerto Rico Medical Task Force, the health advisory institution on COVID-19 issues in Puerto Rico, is already planning to equip some sports centers and hotels to treat COVID-19 patients before it is too late and before the hospitals and health centers are at full capacity.[13]\n\nOn a positive note, in response to a potential shortage of hand sanitizer, some of Puerto Rico\u2019s distilleries have stepped up to the plate. Serrall\u00e9s Distillery, Inc., has produced 70% ethyl alcohol to provide free of charge to help hospitals and health clinics in Puerto Rico to alleviate the current ethyl alcohol shortage.[14] For its part, as the Miami Herald reports, \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest rum factories, the Bacardi plant in Puerto Rico, has tweaked its production lines to pump out ethanol needed to make hand sanitizers.\u201d[15] The bottles of hand sanitizers are to be distributed among those health and security personnel and volunteers who work day after day against the spread of the pandemic. Without a doubt, these are just two examples of how Puerto Rican companies have joined forces to fight the pandemic.\n\nThe Department of Health has published a preparedness and response plan against the COVID-19 entitled \u201cPlan de Preparaci\u00f3n y Respuesta ante el Coronavirus Novel 19 COVID-19.\u201d[16] In collaboration with the Puerto Rico Medical Task Force COVID-19, the government of Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans are taking to the social networks to share information, help raise awareness, and educate citizenry about the importance of staying home for the duration of the pandemic and until the Center for Disease Control changes its recommended protocols.[17]\n\nErick Javier Padilla Rosas is a Philosophy master student in the Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies at Louisiana State University (LSU), where he works as a teaching assistant.

In the last 24 hours, 1,095 tests were conducted, the government said on Twitter.\n\nA total of 112 patents were in hospitals around the country today, 29 of them in intensive care. Four persons were released from hospital in the last 24 hours and one person died.\n\nSo far, a total of 24,857 tests have been performed.\n\nBack to the contents\n\nSTA, 2 April 2020 - The Koper Community Health Centre, one of the 16 coronavirus testing points in Slovenia, has introduced the country's first drive-in system for taking swabs from potentially infected persons to significantly reduce the time needed for a single test.\n\nIn addition to saving time for employees and patients - one test takes 10 instead of 30 minutes - the centre also saves on protective equipment, Ljubica Kolander Bizjak, the director of the centre, has told the STA.\n\nUnder the new system, a person who suspects that they are infected contacts their personal physician, who decides if they should be tested. The person then contacts the community health centre and gets a date for the test.\n\nThe person then drives to a dedicated parking and is swabbed, and then instructed to remain self-isolated until the results of the test are known.\n\nThe drive in testing has been introduced on proposal from employees, who were taking samples in a designated container, where the process took 30 minutes per person, as the container needs to be ventilated for at least 15 minutes and sanitised.\n\nKolander Bizjak said that drive-in testing was performed in two locations in Koper. The average daily number is 40, but the number sometimes reaches 60, and if a test would take 30 minutes, the system would get \"clogged\", she added.\n\nBack to the contents\n\nSTA, 2 April 2020 - Shortages of protective gear during the coronavirus pandemic have prompted that new platforms of providing much needed equipment are opening up in Slovenia, such as creating face masks using 3D printers. An initiative has started developing hospital gear as well as supporting home production.\n\nThe Let's Protect Slovenia initiative has printed out the first 3D face shields in Slovenia in cooperation with the Primorska University, Izola hospital and Ljubljana Technology Park.\n\nThe university has said that the first prototypes have been already despatched to the hospital where they are being tested in the physical world.\n\nSlovenia has thus actively joined foreign countries where the 3D printing technology is already used to mitigate shortages of the coveted gear during the pandemic.\n\nThe masks are printed at the university and are compatible with microbiological filters that are part of medical respirators.\n\nA filter model that has been employed in developing 3D-printed masks is certified to be 99.99% efficient in protecting the wearer. The masks are meant for multiple use to boot.\n\nApart from providing the gear for hospitals, the initiative has also given guidelines on how to use 3D printers to make masks at home. Last week, it made available an open-source format for the Gladius Friends 3D-mask model.\n\nAny 3D printer can be used to make this type of a reusable mask. The initiative thus launched a campaign titled Mask for a Friend, urging citizens to print masks for themselves and their friends.\n\nOpen-source groups in the US and other European countries have started to make use of the prototype of such a home-made mask as well.\n\nIt is important to note though that the mask has not been certified as a medical equipment or personal protective gear.\n\nReservations about the mask for domestic use have emerged as well as warnings regarding its safety. The 3D Slovenija group has warned against using the shield, saying such products are porous and of questionable quality, cannot be sufficiently disinfected, are difficult to fit or seal, with home-made filter systems even posing a potential danger to health.\n\nThe platform has thus proposed that it would be more viable to make only the prototype and then use printing modes of higher quality or even industrial devices to make the masks, mimicking the production process of dive masks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Let's Protect Slovenia initiative insists that it is looking for the best possible solutions in the given situation, conceding that non-certified equipment is not optimal and that there is room for improvement.\n\nTemperatures higher than 56 degrees Celsius kill coronaviruses and printed equipment can be disinfected in an oven. \"We've tried disinfecting at 60 degrees Celsius, 45 minutes in an oven, and it works. I myself have tried it at even higher temperatures and the material endured,\" said microbiologist Teja Bajt of the initiative.\n\nOn the other hand, concerns have been raised about the material reacting to temperatures of 40 degrees already and the chemicals used in the process. The problem with disinfecting it is thus great, said Matej Augu\u0161tin, who works for pharmaceuticals.\n\nBack to the contents\n\nSTA, 2 April 2020 - Slovenj Gradec hospital director Janez Lavre has resigned after finding himself in the limelight over a series of tweets which included threats to withhold coronavirus ventilator treatment to critics of the government.\n\nHealth Minister Toma\u017e Gantar has already accepted the resignation, the Health Ministry said on Thursday.\n\nLavre, a physician who was once considered as potential health minister, published last week a series of politically charged and unethical tweets related to the situation in the country as the nation is fighting the epidemic.\n\n\"Great, you are not getting a ventilator,\" Lavre said in a response to Social Democrats (SD) presidency member Uro\u0161 Jau\u0161evec expressing satisfaction over the SD deciding not to back a government proposal to give the army certain policing powers.\n\nHe also lashed out against investigative journalist Bla\u017e Zgaga over a tweet critical of the government: \"You may be positive soon and then let's hear you squeak.\" He also referred to critical journalists as vermin in at least two of his tweets.\n\nLavre, a member of New Slovenia - Christian Democrats (NSi) until last year, closed down all of his social media accounts on Monday and issued an apology.\n\nHe said he was aware that the statements were inappropriate, offensive and unethical, and blamed them on the workload and mental stress in the face of events related to the handling of the Covid-19 epidemic.\n\nAnnouncing the resignation \"in relation to the inappropriate public communication by the director\", the ministry said today that the matter would be \"subject of further proceedings\".\n\nThe Medical Chamber has already launched due proceeding and said the matter would be discussed by its committee for legal and ethical issues.\n\nBack to the contents","tests":"['24,857 tests', '1,095 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Jan\u0161a was critical of developments in the EU, including of the lack of support for corona bonds.\n\nIn a special announcement on Tuesday evening, Jan\u0161a said that the government was examining the possibility of relaunching manufacturing, part of the services sector, commerce and transport if protective measures are implemented.\n\nProvided that the epidemic eases further, that testing is expanded at critical points such as nursing homes and that infections are better controlled, some restrictions of movement could also be gradually eased, the prime minister added.\n\n\"But we must be aware of the undeniable fact that an alternative to loosing supervision of the source of the contagion can only be drastic restriction of contacts.\"\n\nJan\u0161a suggested that the healthcare system was still exposed, as almost a fifth of all infested persons in Slovenia are healthcare workers. \"The curve of the spreading of the virus is no longer climbing steeply, it is more horizontal, but it is still not dropping.\"\n\nHe added that without control of infected persons and additional testing of their contacts, it would not be possible to scale down the current movement restrictions only to a few areas.\n\nJan\u0161a noted that people sticking to the restriction of movement to the municipal boundaries had significantly reduced the possibility of new infections and creation of new hot spots last week.\n\nHe also called for understanding of the \"fact that we cannot ease certain measures as quickly as the countries which reacted to the epidemic days or even weeks ahead of us, while they were also institutionally ready, unlike us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jan\u0161a also voiced criticism of the EU, saying \"European solidarity, which depends solely on the institutions of the EU, does not exist in practice when it comes to protective equipment\".\n\n\"Since the start of the epidemic we've not received a single mask, a single piece of protective equipment, not a single ventilator from the EU. Not a single so called joint European procurement procedure has been completed with even one supply case,\" he said.\n\nJan\u0161a commended the ECB and European commission on easing aid rules, but added: \"However, the key instrument, so called corona bonds...still do not have sufficient support from the wealthiest EU members. This is the point where the future of our joint currency is weighed today, as well as the future of the EU.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition Left and Social Democrats (SD) again called on the government to lift the ban on non-essential travel between municipalities, arguing that a vast majority of people are sticking to the lockdown measures.\n\nThe SD said that citizens were disciplined and protected their own health and health of their families, adding that the ban on travel outside the municipality of the permanent or temporary residence was \"nonsensical and excessive.\"\n\nLeft MP Matej T. Vatovec said that \"we see that the things are moving slightly forward, and we hope that the government will also realise that certain measures were premature and that it will start taking steps back.\"\n\nBack to the contents","tests":"['29,455 tests', '489 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The number of new coronavirus cases increased by 46 to 802 after 1,125 persons were tested on Monday.\n\nAt least one of the four persons died at the University Clinic of Respiratory and Allergic Diseases at Golnik, according to coronavirus crisis spokesperson Jelko Kacin.\n\nAs many as 119 Covid-19 patients were in hospital, of whom 28 were in intensive care, on Monday, when six patients were released from hospital.\n\nThe number of persons who have been so far been tested for the virus in Slovenia has risen to 22,474.\n\nNursing homes continue to be hot spots as contagion spreads there at a fast pace, and persons accommodated there are the most vulnerable to coronavirus and the death rate the highest among them.\n\nAddressing the press on the issue today, director of the Golnik clinic for pulmonary diseases Ale\u0161 Rozman said that nursing homes were a \"battlefield\" on which the future spreading of the epidemic would depend.\n\n\"We are afraid of small epidemics in nursing homes - there are around 115 of them in Slovenia - completely filling up our healthcare system and us facing unnecessary casualties,\" he added.\n\nTask forces have thus been established, comprising experts from hospitals and primary care, with the priority task of preventing the spreading of the virus in nursing homes with confirmed Covid-19 cases.\n\nThey will also examine the transfer routes and try to prevent infections in nursing homes where there are no confirmed cases yet, Rozman added.\n\nOne of these hot spots is the nursing home in Ljutomer (NE), where the number of confirmed cases increased in one day by ten to 16 on Tuesday.

The coalition alone has proposed more than 100 amendments and the opposition has come with amendments of its own.\n\nSome six hours into the session, committee chair Robert Polnar of the coalition Pensioner's Party (DeSUS) said that the discussion was over for today and that it would be continued on Wednesday.\n\nThe plenary session of the National Assembly, originally scheduled for Wednesday at 10am, is to be held on Thursday, \"but only if the committee concludes its work on Wednesday,\" Polnar said.\n\nThe government's plan is that the measures apply for April and May, with the possibility of extension until the end of June.\n\nIn today's debate, support was expressed by committee members from all deputy groups, while many of them also pointed to the possibility of abuse and considerable burden on public finances, and also proposed other beneficiaries.\n\nThe opposition also warned against haste in the adoption of the legislation. \"Financially-speaking, this is the most extensive law the National Assembly has ever discussed,\" said Luka Mesec of the Left, calling for thorough talks.\n\nAndreja Zabret (LM\u0160) also pointed to the high figure and wanted the finance minister to guarantee that the measures will be financed in a manner which will not bring \"headache to citizens when everything is said and done.\"\n\nMinister Andrej \u0160ircelj said that there was enough money in the budget for now, and mentioned the possibility of additional borrowing, but would not go into details as this could trigger an increase in interest rates.\n\nHe did guarantee that the measures will not be financed by means of possible higher taxes. \"The last thing I have in mind right now is raising taxes,\" he added.\n\nRobert Pav\u0161i\u010d (LM\u0160) called for more time, adding that MPs had been constantly receiving calls from many associations and individuals who \"are not able to find themselves in this law\".\n\nThe Left demands that financial aid should be provided to all, regardless of the form of employment, including precarious workers and workers hired by temping agencies, as well as to persons who lease apartments and commercial premises.\n\nMatja\u017e Han of the SD proposed that the measures be applied retroactively as of the date when the epidemic was declared in Slovenia - 13 March. \"This is very important and many people would calm down if we do so.\"\n\nMa\u0161a Kociper of the Alenka Bratu\u0161ek Party (SAB) called for clear criteria to be determined for who was eligible for financial aid and under what conditions, in order to prevent violations and abuse.\n\nSince three billion euros will be distributed quickly, Kociper thinks that whether the criteria are being met should be supervised. \"We need parliamentary supervision of some sorts,\" she added.\n\nThe committee will continue the session on Wednesday, going through the amendments filed.\n\nBack to the contents\n\nSTA, 31 March 2020 - Slovenian civil defence has received a donation of protective and medical equipment from Hisense, the Chinese owner of the Velenje-based household appliance maker Gorenje, which includes 200,000 protective masks and 2,000 hazmat suits.\n\nAlso donated by Hisense are 500 respirators, protective goggles and a medical ventilator, while the company has also mediated in an agreement to supply 46 ventilators to Slovenia, Gorenje said on Monday.\n\nEconomy Minister Zdravko Po\u010dival\u0161ek has tweeted that the ventilators had already arrived in Slovenia.\n\nHisense Europe Group president Alex Zhu added that the company was trying to help by donating equipment and sharing good practices for preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus and protecting employees' health.\n\nThe company has also made a warehouse in China's Qingdao, where Hisense is based, available for Slovenia to collect all donations of protective equipment from China, which is then transported to the local airport.\n\nPo\u010dival\u0161ek said earlier that the government was \"thankful to all donors which already have and will in the future help by donating protective equipment.

Jan\u0161a was critical of developments in the EU, including of the lack of support for corona bonds.\n\nIn a special announcement on Tuesday evening, Jan\u0161a said that the government was examining the possibility of relaunching manufacturing, part of the services sector, commerce and transport if protective measures are implemented.\n\nProvided that the epidemic eases further, that testing is expanded at critical points such as nursing homes and that infections are better controlled, some restrictions of movement could also be gradually eased, the prime minister added.\n\n\"But we must be aware of the undeniable fact that an alternative to loosing supervision of the source of the contagion can only be drastic restriction of contacts.\"\n\nJan\u0161a suggested that the healthcare system was still exposed, as almost a fifth of all infested persons in Slovenia are healthcare workers. \"The curve of the spreading of the virus is no longer climbing steeply, it is more horizontal, but it is still not dropping.\"\n\nHe added that without control of infected persons and additional testing of their contacts, it would not be possible to scale down the current movement restrictions only to a few areas.\n\nJan\u0161a noted that people sticking to the restriction of movement to the municipal boundaries had significantly reduced the possibility of new infections and creation of new hot spots last week.\n\nHe also called for understanding of the \"fact that we cannot ease certain measures as quickly as the countries which reacted to the epidemic days or even weeks ahead of us, while they were also institutionally ready, unlike us.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Jan\u0161a also voiced criticism of the EU, saying \"European solidarity, which depends solely on the institutions of the EU, does not exist in practice when it comes to protective equipment\".\n\n\"Since the start of the epidemic we've not received a single mask, a single piece of protective equipment, not a single ventilator from the EU. Not a single so called joint European procurement procedure has been completed with even one supply case,\" he said.\n\nJan\u0161a commended the ECB and European commission on easing aid rules, but added: \"However, the key instrument, so called corona bonds...still do not have sufficient support from the wealthiest EU members. This is the point where the future of our joint currency is weighed today, as well as the future of the EU.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the opposition Left and Social Democrats (SD) again called on the government to lift the ban on non-essential travel between municipalities, arguing that a vast majority of people are sticking to the lockdown measures.\n\nThe SD said that citizens were disciplined and protected their own health and health of their families, adding that the ban on travel outside the municipality of the permanent or temporary residence was \"nonsensical and excessive.\"\n\nLeft MP Matej T. Vatovec said that \"we see that the things are moving slightly forward, and we hope that the government will also realise that certain measures were premature and that it will start taking steps back.\"\n\nBack to the contents","tests":"['29,455 tests', '489 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases rose by 37 to 934, the government has announced.\n\nA total of 1,064 tests were performed yesterday to put the overall number at 25,921. The number of hospitalised persons is at 112, 30 of whom are in intensive care, five have been discharged from hospital, the government said on Twitter.\n\nAs many as 135 of Slovenia's 212 municipalities have recorded at least one confirmed infection and 85 recorded two or more cases.\n\nWhile the capital Ljubljana still has the highest number of cases, at 158, up three in a day, the outbreaks elsewhere are centred around care homes.\n\nThe biggest jump in new cases was recorded in Ljutomer in the north-east of the country, by eight to 46. All eight new cases were at the old-age facility there where now 41 are infected.\n\nTo contain the spread, fifteen healthy residents of the facility who are able to look after themselves have been moved to be quarantined at the apartments of the tourist complex Bioterme Mala.\n\nThe biggest hot spot is at the care home at \u0160marje pri Jel\u0161ah, where 60 residents and 15 staff were infected according to data as of Wednesday.\n\nOnly data for the whole \u0160marje pri Jel\u0161ah community are available for Thursday showing that the number of infections there rose by four to 116.\n\nAnother hot spot is a nursing home in Horjul, a community just west of Ljubljana that saw its tally of cases rise by two to 26 on Thursday.\n\nAs of Wednesday 19 of the infected were residents at the nursing home and four were staff, who have been quarantined at home.\n\nOut of seven residents tested on Thursday, two were positive, the Horjul facility manager said on Friday, which would put the total number of the infected there to 21, plus four staff.\n\nThe Horjul facility manager said that four of the residents who fell ill with Covid-19 were being treated at hospital.\n\nBack to the contents\n\nSTA, 3 April 2020 - The government is examining how to gradually restart the economy amidst the lockdown, but in order to do so a sufficient amount of personal protective equipment must be secured, the government's spokesman for the coronavirus epidemic, Jelko Kacin, told the press on Friday. The goal is to domestically produce 100,000 masks daily.\n\n\"The Ministry of Economic Development and Technology is prioritising domestic production of protective equipment that would be available to workers,\" he said, adding that the business sector was behind only healthcare and nursing homes when it came to the distribution of protective equipment.\n\nEconomy Minister Zdravko Po\u010dival\u0161ek yesterday visited several companies that produce protective gear. \"Our intention is to secure at least 100,000 face masks daily from local production.\" The number has already been achieved, Kacin said, but added that \"demand will be high\".\n\nPo\u010dival\u0161ek yesterday visited Prevent&Deloza, a maker of protective equipment that he said is already producing 10,000 washable face masks daily according to a design approved by UKC Ljubljana, Slovenia's largest hospital.\n\nSeveral other companies that do not specialise in protective equipment have started producing masks in recent weeks, including car upholstery maker Boxmark in Kidri\u010devo, which produces over 6,000 face masks daily for the national stockpile, and several other major textile companies which have not disclosed their output.\n\nDozens of small sewing businesses around the country have joined the effort as well and many municipalities have already started distributing face masks to residents, usually of the washable variety.\n\nAt the same time, efforts continue on an ongoing basis to secure enough protective equipment for the hospital setting.\n\nPo\u010dival\u0161ek said on Twitter today that a million three-layer masks had just been delivered to the Commodity Reserves Institute's main warehouse in Ljubljana. Earlier this week a million surgical masks and 200,000 of the higher-grade FFP2 masks had been delivered from Czechia.\n\nBack to the contents\n\nSTA, 3 April 2020 - Starting today and all through Sunday, the police will be preventing people from gathering in public places and controlling whether they leave their place of residence. This comes after tourist destinations were overflowing last weekend and the government decided to restrict movement to place of residence in an effort to rein in Covid-19 contagion.\n\nThe police said on its website last night that adhering to the restrictions in place is of utmost importance for the benefit of everybody.\n\nThe oversight will be conducted on motorways and other roads, as well as in other locations, especially near popular destinations.\n\nThe police has also set up a hotline to help those with questions about the restrictions. The hotline is available every day of the week between 7am and 7pm at 01 514 70 01. Questions can also be sent to This email address is being protected from spambots.

Moreover, construction work where there is no contact to the client will also be allowed from Friday.\n\nThe government decided to allow florists' and nurseries to reopen because spring is a peak selling time for these businesses that invested a lot of funds and work in growing seedlings and other plants, which would go to waste unless they are sold, the government Communications Office said after a correspondence session on Thursday.\n\nMoreover, construction work will be allowed at construction sites that are not used as living spaces and where the workers have no contact with the clients.\n\nNevertheless, those involved will be obligated to use face masks and gloves and to keep a safe distance from others.\n\nConsumers can only go to the nearest florist or nursery. If there is no such business in the municipality of their residence, they may cross into another municipality.\n\nBack to the contents\n\nSTA, 3 April 2020 - The government will discuss on Friday guidelines for a second fiscal stimulus package after its first, EUR 3 billion bill was passed in parliament on Thursday. The new measures will bring some corrections to the law passed yesterday and new measures to address liquidity, investment and employment legislation.\n\nFinance Minister Andrej \u0160ircelj announced at the start of the week that the government was already working on additional measures to mitigate the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\"Once we have mitigated the negative consequences of the epidemic, we will encourage the economy, liquidity and investment, with new measures,\" he said.\n\nThe government is examining the proposals put forward by deputy groups to improve the first law, which was adopted in a hurry so it has some flaws, coronavirus crisis spokesperson Jelko Kacin told the press on Friday. \"We want to examine, harmonise and prepare these things for the second package.\"\n\nAt the same time the government is examining possible measures to boost the economy's liquidity, he said, noting these two groups of measures will be \"the core of the second package\".\n\nThe government would like to adopt the second bill in ten days, and then immediately send it to parliament, he explained at today's first government media briefing.\n\nThe government will be helped by the advisory task force led by economist Matej Lahovnik, which also advised it on the first package, according to economist Marko Jakli\u010d, a member of the task force.\n\nHe said the task force had split into three groups - one focusing on liquidity, another on labour market and flexicurity and the third one on investment.\n\nThe liquidity group has already embarked on work so the set of measure to boost liquidity of Slovenian companies should be ready shortly, he told the Odmevi news show on public broadcaster TV Slovenija last evening.\n\nThe second group will draft measures that are to address the challenges on the labour market after 1 June, according to Jakli\u010d.\n\nThe measures featured in the EUR 3 billion coronavirus law passed yesterday are valid from mid-March when the epidemic was declared until end-May, possibly a month longer.\n\nTrade unions are however upset that the government continues to ignore social dialogue.\n\nThe ZSSS association thus urged Labour Minister Janez Cigler Kralj today to involve the Economic and Social Council, the country's main industrial relations forum, in drafting the new measures, at least those related to the labour market.\n\nBack to the contents","tests":"['1,064 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The case of the Republic of Cyprus","text":"While in some countries the emergency measures were assigned a fixed term of weeks or months, in others this was left open for review at an unspecified date in the future. Although violating civil liberties in unprecedented ways in peace-time democracy, in most cases these regulations were instituted \u201clegally\u201d, voted in by parliaments and following the stipulated constitutional procedures. In some east and south European states however, such niceties were deemed unaffordable luxuries in times of crisis.\n\nAn absent EU\n\nThe EU so far has been largely absent from the whole crisis management operation and only came to post facto accept or turn a blind eye to the initiatives taken by the nation-states even when these violated treaties, principles, rules and regulations. A lot has been said about the economic consequences of the lock-down measures and on the sealing of national borders. A lot of speculation is also being expressed about the magnitude of the debt crisis looming ahead and the future of the Eurozone and the EU amidst resurgent divisions and polarisation among member-states. There is less discussion on the authoritarian drift observed and what there is tends to focus on eastern Europe, which already manifested authoritarian trends before the Covid-19 crisis. Hungary is the most cited example where Orban\u2019s government secured the power to rule by decree without parliamentary scrutiny, and restrict free speech without an end date.\n\nThe public health system\n\nThe authoritarian measures of movement restriction are justified through a discourse of \u201cscience\u201d, with lock-down presented as the implementation of physical distancing. While the example of China and the recommendations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) are cited by European states for this, most of them underplay or ignore the other half of the story: the rapid and massive diversion of resources into the public health system undertaken by China and the widespread testing of the population.\n\nAs the WHO tirelessly insists, \u201clock-down on its own cannot solve the problem\u201d, it seems that at least some European states are using authoritarian measures of population control as a substitute for the needed upscaling of public health system capacity. Through the enhanced \u201clegitimacy\u201d assumed as a result of the fear that has overtaken wide sections of society and through their friendly media some governments are able to frame the public health crisis as a public security crisis, invoking war imagery and discourse that shifts public debate and the public attention from state failures to \u201cdisobedient\u201d individual citizens who need disciplining through ever-escalating collective punitive measures. The Republic of Cyprus is one of the most extreme examples of this in Europe and deserves to be more closely examined.\n\nAuthoritarian Cyprus\n\nAs Covid-19 began to spread in Europe in February, the Cyprus government initially ignored it taking no measures at all with respect to its busy airports and making no attempt to boost the capacity of its newly instituted NHS system (GESY) and its already crumbling public hospitals.\n\nAt the end of the month it surprised everybody by unilaterally closing 4 of the 7 crossings under its control to the northern part of the country in a nationalist and populist move, alleging that the threat to public health came from the Turkish Cypriot community, provoking the reaction of the peace and reunification movement and shifting public attention away from public health to the politics of Cyprus\u2019 division.\n\nSoon the nationalist political authorities in the Turkish Cypriot community responded to the Greek Cypriot nationalist challenge by closing different additional crossings. When the first case of Covid-19 appeared in the island contracted by UK and German travellers, on the same day in the south and north respectively, all the crossings between the two parts of Cyprus were blocked. Ignoring the calls of the peace movement for cooperation and coordination between the two sides to combat the spread of the virus, the Republic of Cyprus oriented itself towards Greece instead which it emulated using even identical phraseology in the instituting of lock-down measures. The Republic of Cyprus\u2019 measures, however, soon came to surpass those of Greece in severity, disproportionality as well as irrationality.\n\nNot only did the Republic of Cyprus completely prohibit entry into Cyprus to visitors from anywhere, it was also the only state in the world to block its own citizens who found themselves abroad and in need of returning. After leaving thousands of citizens stranded abroad for a week and after the public outcry this provoked, it allowed some of them who were temporarily abroad to return and placed them in precautionary quarantine for 14 days, claiming that this would be extended for some other categories of Cypriots such as workers and students in the future.\n\nBesides closing-down non-essential industries, it also closed public parks and made it illegal for everybody to leave their home without an \u201cessential reason\u201d. Eight such \u201cessential reasons\u201d were listed in a print form, from which everybody had to tick one and sign, specifying the time and presenting it to the increased police patrols which were supplemented by army personnel.\n\nOn March 30, further restrictions were imposed, making a prior permit issued by the police via its reply to the SMS application obligatory to every person under 65 years old while only 1 exit from one\u2019s domicile per day was allowed and none between 21.00-6.00. A maximum of 3 persons per car was instituted and more alarmingly it was announced that the police would check homes to see if there were persons inside there other than the home residents. After the public outcry that this provoked, the government retreated clarifying that this would only be done either with consent or a court warrant.\n\nNo mere incompetence\n\nWhile incompetence can take us some way in accounting for the rushed, disproportionate and irrational measures adopted by Anastasiades\u2019 government, the picture cannot be completed unless the chronic inefficiency of the Republic of Cyprus as a state is accounted for as well, and the condition of its public health system more specifically.\n\nWhile in 1990 there was one hospital bed per 170 persons, in 2017 the underfunding of health led this to shrink to one bed per 290 persons. With an EU average of 541 hospital beds per 100 000 residents, Cyprus has 339. Long-term health care expenditure in many EU countries surpasses 20% of their total health spending, while in Cyprus the equivalent figure is 3%. At an EU average of total health spending of 10% of GDP, in Cyprus this stands at merely 6.8%.\n\nCovid-19 found the Cyprus health system totally unprepared, lacking intensive care units and critical care physicians, lacking equipment and even protective equipment and disposables. In the first week, three of the country\u2019s five main public hospitals had to close entire sections as numerous health professionals became infected with Covid-19, testing was limited to only a few hundred per day until the end of March and there was no new hiring of health professionals to staff the already understaffed hospitals. The government restricted itself to the use of medical and nursing students and no significant effort was made to divert funds to public health.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['541 hospital beds']","ppe":null}

Health authorities reported the patient as a Spanish national who arrived on a military flight and was directly put in quarantine with no contact with the Djiboutian population. Other Spanish military passengers are being quarantined with support from the French military base.\n\n\u201cThe first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Djibouti reaffirms the message that no country is immune to this disease and that surveillance, prevention and hygiene promotion are the best preparedness actions a country can take.

Etienne assured that she will inquire about the tests.\n\n\u201cWe know and we recognised a lot more people want to know, want to get tested.\u201d\n\nHowever, she added, \u201cwe want to err on the side of caution but we are waiting until WHO gives an endorsement and once we get an endorsement, we would want to consider making screening more affordable\u2026If and when we get approval from the WHO, a lot more people will be tested.\u201d\n\nThe rapid screening test was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and provides results within 15 minutes to 45 minutes. It can be used in temporary screening locations, the doctor\u2019s office labs and nursing homes to detect the new Coronavirus strain.\n\nThe Government of Guyana is currently using Confirmatory and Diagnostic test kits, some donated by the PAHO\/WHO.\n\nDirector of Disease Control, Dr Nadia Liu explained that with the current testing kits, it takes 24 hours to get to the lab and another eight hours for testing.\n\nMeanwhile, Country Representative for PAHO\/WHO, Dr William Adu-Krow debunked claims that the lack of mass-testing is due to a lack of testing kits.\n\nHe said there are strict guidelines in terms of testing, which also exists in the US and Europe.\n\n1,400 cases predicted for Guyana\n\nProjections by the PAHO\/WHO suggests that Guyana will confirm roughly 1,400 cases of the novel coronavirus by the end of the global pandemic. Of that amount, 100 can end up in Intensive Care Units.\n\nIn this regard, the Ministry will be preparing 100 ICU beds across the country.\n\nMeanwhile, Public Health Minister Volda Lawrence said of the total projected cases for Guyana, 81 per cent will be moderate, 14 per cent severe and five per cent critical.\n\nShe expressed confidence in the ministry\u2019s preparedness to handle the projected cases. She disclosed that the health ministry will have 300 isolation beds in place for persons who are projected to contract the disease while there will be 730 beds for those who will be under quarantine.\n\nAs of March 30, 2020, in Guyana, a total of 46 persons have been tested for the disease.\n\nThirty-seven of the persons tested negative while eight tested positive.\n\nOf the eight confirmed cases in Guyana, five were locally transmitted. Two of the confirmed cases have now been placed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and there is one death reported on March 11.\n\nOne person\u2019s test was inconclusive.

In a March 25 press conference, President Solih announced that the country was in a state of lockdown and all on-arrival visas would be cancelled beginning March 27, 2020. He also extended the closure of government offices, schools, and universities until April 5, 2020.\n\nPres Solih: Certain decisions made does hinder normal life, but these decisions are made for the safety of everyone. We are implementing more decisions based on the situation. Starting next Sunday, Government Offices, Schools and Colleges will be closed for an extra week. \u2014 Muallim Ibrahim (@Muallimsays) March 25, 2020\n\nPres Solih: Starting March 27th, we will stop issuing on-arrival visa to foreigners. Resorts will be placed on quarantine for 14 days after the last tourists leave. Even though those positive are recovering, we must not consider this as a situation where it will not spread more. \u2014 Muallim Ibrahim (@Muallimsays) March 25, 2020\n\nOn March 17, all government offices except emergency services, the courts, media, and financial institutions were ordered to close from March 19 to 26 to tackle the coronavirus pandemic. The president also stated that the country was fully prepared for a worst-case scenario by installing 200 ICU beds. However, as the country is dependent on income from tourism, netizens are questioning whether the Maldives can afford the lockdown.\n\nTimeline of the outbreak\n\nThe first cases were detected in two foreign nationals working at a tourist resort on March 7. Both of the cases had been in contact with an Italian tourist who tested positive for the virus after returning to Italy. The number of infections has now risen to 13. Of those, eight have recovered.\n\nAs the global travel industry comes to a grinding halt, countries that are totally dependent on tourism are feeling the immense economic strain as tourist arrivals are reduced to a trickle. More than 50 resorts have already closed down temporarily due to the decline in visitors. Workers also have suffered a pay cut.\n\nThe government declared a health emergency on March 12 for 30 days while the Health Protection Agency (HPA) has introduced sweeping measures including a ban on guesthouses on inhabited islands from accepting tourists. The HPA has banned workers in resorts from travelling to and from the resorts, and dine-in services in cafes and restaurants in the capital, Mal\u00e9, were stopped.\n\nResidents of Mal\u00e9, a tiny island of less than 2 square kilometres and home to 150,000 people, are being encouraged to stay indoors as much as possible.\n\nThe azan today in Male\u2019 , #Maldives was changed due to the coronavirus. instead of \u201chayya alas-salah\u201d (come to prayer), the muadhin says \u201cal-salatu fi buyutikum\u201d (pray in your homes). May Allah protect us all and allow us to go back to his house soon inshaAllah. pic.twitter.com\/KYvKCt2kOF \u2014 Qibla (@QiblaMv) March 18, 2020\n\nImpact on the economy\n\nLast year, the Maldives was visited by over 1.5 million tourists. The country set a target of 2 million tourists in 2020. However, COVID-19 is set to dash hopes of achieving this goal.\n\nOn March 9, 2020, the country imposed a travel ban on visitors from China, Iran, Italy, parts of South Korea, Bangladesh and all cruise ships. On March 15, certain European countries were added to the list.\n\nChina and Italy, two of the most affected countries, are also the biggest markets for Maldives tourism. The tourism arrivals declined by 14.3 percent in February this year. In March, after the bans, it fell considerably more.\n\nAny significant decline in tourist arrivals has a ripple effect on Maldives\u2019 economy: presidenthttps:\/\/t.co\/LRUTZHARQk \u2014 raajje.mv (@raajjemv) March 15, 2020\n\nThe blanket ban on tourists including cruise ships will hit the country's economy and it will likely face a serious shortfall in foreign currency earnings.\n\nSocial media users are divided among those who view a complete lockdown as the only option to stop the virus from creating havoc while others believe that the country simply cannot afford a ban on foreign tourists and a complete lockdown.\n\nJenny Latheef views a complete lockdown as the solution:\n\nA total #LockDown will save MORE money than partial lockdowns. And early opening of the country before the rest of the world has contained the virus too! Only together can the world be rid of this #coronavirus. \u2014 Jenny Latheef (@LitmusTimes) March 24, 2020\n\nAli Hussain responds to Amhar who asks if a total lockdown can be afforded:\n\nThe rent and bills would be cheaper than infecting yourself, bringing it to your home and infecting your family. And if you lose a family member to the virus\u2026. Can you afford it? \u2014 Ali Hussain (@AliEHussain) March 16, 2020\n\nIsra questions the measure of confining workers, even those who are no longer employed, to resorts while tourists were allowed to arrive for holidays, till the latest decision not to issue on-arrival visa:\n\nSo, just forcing people to stay in an island where they are no longer employed, without any suspected cases of Covid19 but also not restricting travelers who may potentially carry the virus to the resorts? https:\/\/t.co\/NU5yf52wsE \u2014 Isra \ud83c\udf88 (@IsraSaudulla) March 17, 2020\n\nUmran tweets:\n\nuh-huh. As long as there are links from resorts to population centers, quarantine exceptions for resort guests remain a significant risk\u2026 Lockdown population centers before going about your last ditch efforts to save tourism\u2026 This is getting real tiring now\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/9pIL2rmZEf \u2014 Umran (@phantomread_) March 20, 2020\n\nHowever, some workers in resorts such as Saaif Zaryr support the government's move to confine workers:\n\nI work at a resort and I applaud the governments decision to lockdown resorts. The vast majority of the cases in Maldives originated within resorts. It is in the best interest of the general public that people working in resorts be prevented from mingling with the general public. https:\/\/t.co\/XmP5xXGFBK \u2014 Saaif Zaryr (@SaaifZaryr) March 15, 2020\n\nMeanwhile, Faraz asks if the money generated by tourism benefits the people:\n\nTourism generates more value than, let's say, fishing. But where does that value go? To offshore accounts! What good does that do to anyone? https:\/\/t.co\/oBasfQpMAV \u2014 Abdulla \ud83d\ude37 Faraz (@n3m6) March 23, 2020\n\nThe Maldives is also using several resorts to quarantine suspected persons in separate islands near the capital Mal\u00e9. As per the previous decision before lockdown, Maldives nationals arriving from abroad were being quarantined for 14 days in these designated places with the exception of tourists checking in to their pre-booked resorts.","tests":null,"ventilators":null,"beds":"['200 ICU beds']","ppe":null}

The company says that its test delivers a negative result in 13 minutes when the virus is not detected.\n\nThe U.S. has been trying for weeks to ramp up coronavirus testing after a series of problems with the initial government-designed test. The nation\u2019s daily testing capacity has been increasing as more diagnostic makers and large laboratories have developed tests.\n\nAbbott\u2019s testing cartridge fits into the company\u2019s portable ID NOW device, which is used at hospitals, clinics and doctors\u2019 offices. The company said it would launch the test next week to select health care facilities that deliver urgent care.\n\nThe Abbott approval follows two other rapid tests cleared by regulators in the past week. Older laboratory-developed tests can take between 4 to 8 hours to deliver results.\n\nHealth experts say the U.S. should be testing 100,000 to 150,000 people per day to track and contain the virus. There are no official nationwide testing metrics, but private and public health labs currently report testing about 80,000 to 90,000 patients per day.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said there are certain parts of the country that will not be ready to return to a semblance of normalcy when his administration\u2019s 15-day guideline to stem the spread of the new coronavirus expires next week.\n\nTrump, who issued his guidelines on March 16, said he will meet with Vice President Mike Pence, White House task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx and top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday or Tuesday to review data on the spread of the disease.\n\nTrump in a letter to governors Thursday said that risk considerations based on geography would likely dictate the next round of guidelines from the federal government.

They are separate from, and in addition to, National Guard members who have been mobilized by governors.\n\nThe reserve call-up likely is intended to fill gaps in medical expertise as the military deploys field hospitals to cities hard hit by COVID-19 and provides other forms of medical support to state and local authorities.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump says he will press U.S. manufacturers to build 100,000 ventilators \u201cpretty quickly\u201d to meet the needs of American hospitals and medical providers around the world.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for the building of more ventilators comes one day after he pushed back on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who cited medical experts' prediction that his state will need 30,000 to 40,000 ventilators when the coronavirus outbreak peaks there.\n\nTrump said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday stressed the need for more ventilators in his country.

The company says that its test delivers a negative result in 13 minutes when the virus is not detected.\n\nThe U.S. has been trying for weeks to ramp up coronavirus testing after a series of problems with the initial government-designed test. The nation\u2019s daily testing capacity has been increasing as more diagnostic makers and large laboratories have developed tests.\n\nAbbott\u2019s testing cartridge fits into the company\u2019s portable ID NOW device, which is used at hospitals, clinics and doctors\u2019 offices. The company said it would launch the test next week to select health care facilities that deliver urgent care.\n\nThe Abbott approval follows two other rapid tests cleared by regulators in the past week. Older laboratory-developed tests can take between 4 to 8 hours to deliver results.\n\nHealth experts say the U.S. should be testing 100,000 to 150,000 people per day to track and contain the virus. There are no official nationwide testing metrics, but private and public health labs currently report testing about 80,000 to 90,000 patients per day.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said there are certain parts of the country that will not be ready to return to a semblance of normalcy when his administration\u2019s 15-day guideline to stem the spread of the new coronavirus expires next week.\n\nTrump, who issued his guidelines on March 16, said he will meet with Vice President Mike Pence, White House task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx and top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday or Tuesday to review data on the spread of the disease.\n\nTrump in a letter to governors Thursday said that risk considerations based on geography would likely dictate the next round of guidelines from the federal government.

They are separate from, and in addition to, National Guard members who have been mobilized by governors.\n\nThe reserve call-up likely is intended to fill gaps in medical expertise as the military deploys field hospitals to cities hard hit by COVID-19 and provides other forms of medical support to state and local authorities.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump says he will press U.S. manufacturers to build 100,000 ventilators \u201cpretty quickly\u201d to meet the needs of American hospitals and medical providers around the world.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for the building of more ventilators comes one day after he pushed back on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who cited medical experts' prediction that his state will need 30,000 to 40,000 ventilators when the coronavirus outbreak peaks there.\n\nTrump said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday stressed the need for more ventilators in his country. He added Italy, Germany and Spain are also in need of more ventilators.\n\nTrump said he believes U.S. manufacturers are able to take care of American needs while also helping other countries.\n\n___\n\nAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 Jordan has announced its first death from the new coronavirus.\n\nState-run news agency Petra said Friday a woman in her 80s died from COVID-19.

John Rotruck told The Associated Press in an interview from the ship as it was heading into the port.\n\nThe Mercy\u2019s arrival comes as the USNS Comfort, the Navy's other hospital ship, prepares to leave Virginia on Saturday, heading to New York City.\n\nThe ships will take only non-virus patients, freeing up hospital beds in the city for those who are infected.\n\nThere are about 1,000 sailors on the Mercy, and about two-thirds of that are medical staff. They\u2019ve spent the last several days at sea training, since this is the first time that many of them will have worked together.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday signed a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package, calling the bill much-needed relief for American workers reeling from the economic tumult caused by the coronavirus.\n\nTrump signed the bill in Oval Office ceremony surrounded by Republican lawmakers and members of his administration shortly after the Democratic-controlled House approved the massive spending package. Under the plan, many single Americans would receive $1,200, married couples would get $2,400 and parents would see $500 for each child.\n\nThe signing came the after the U.S. government on Thursday reported nearly 3.3 million new weekly jobless claims. The U.S. death toll has surpassed 1,200 from the virus.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump has issued an order that the government can use to require General Motors to produce ventilators under Defense Production Act.\n\nTrump signed the order Friday in the Oval Office as health professionals around the country lamented shortages of the machines that help patients with the coronavirus breathe.\n\nIn a joint statement, GM and Ventec Life Systems said they will build critical care ventilators at GM's manufacturing plant in Kokomo, Indiana, and start shipping them as soon as next month. GM also is to produce surgical masks at its plant in Warren, Michigan, that can be used by health care workers.\n\nIn a statement, the White House accused GM of wasting time in the contracting process.\n\n\"Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive, but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course,\" the statement said.","tests":null,"ventilators":"['100,000 ventilators', '40,000 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

What is more worrisome, is that more than fifty (50) health care workers have been identified as contacts of diagnosed\/confirmed cases. These health care workers are currently in quarantine, and are being monitored for the development of symptoms.\n\nClearly, if more health care workers are removed from the available pool, there will be no soldiers left to fight the COVID war. We must protect our frontline workers. The best way to do this is to stay at home!\u201d\n\nMinister, Dr. Duane Sands wants what officials around the world want \u2013 for people to live through this pandemic by following the protocols, though difficult.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCurrently, there are 23 cases in New Providence; 5 cases in Grand Bahama; and 1 case from Bimini. This equates to almost one new case each day. If we continue on this path, our health care system will be overwhelmed and unable to meet the demands. Social and physical distancing and responsible handwashing are the two mitigating actions that will help us to combat the strength of this virus,\u201d said the Minister during a presentation in the House of Assembly.\n\nThe nation learned that the People\u2019s Republic of China has donated 1,000 test kits and The Bahamas now has 10,000 rapid tests which will mean wider screening at the community level.\n\n\u201cWe are exploring the introduction of rapid testing. The first step in the process requires in-country validation of the rapid serological testing. Once this validation is completed, wider screening for COVID-19 at the community level will commence. There are 10,000 rapid test kits in-country.\u201d\n\nChinese Embassy, The Bahamas\n\nMore challenging however, as the world competes for the same products, is for The Bahamas to ensure the frontline soldiers in Health Care are adequately outfitted for the battle.\n\n\u201cWith this in mind, we are aggressively exploring various ways and means to acquire more personal protective equipment (PPE) inventory and other supplies. The global shortage of PPEs and other needed supplies have resulted in supply chain disruptions. Many countries are holding on to their stock, and others are coveting the stocks found in other countries. Hence, we must manage our current supplies judiciously. Our goal is to ensure that there is a consistent supply of PPEs to frontline nurses, doctors and support staff. With this equipment, they can provide the necessary care to individuals presenting to and being admitted to health care facilities,\u201d said Minister Sands.\n\nThe Bahamas Ministry of Health currently has: 1,000 boxes of surgical masks; 43,995 of N95 masks; 2,418 surgeon gowns; 1,672 healthcare barrier gowns; 238 face shields; 4,590 boxes of gloves; and 6,033+ PPE full kits, (masks, 2 gloves, boot cover, head cover, face shield).\n\nOn Monday, Bahamas Prime Minister, Dr. Hubert Minnis informed that the Public Hospitals Authority will label their medical face masks, that government will purchase all of the medical masks within the marketplace and soon to come is a ban on the sale of these specialized items to the general public.\n\nThe Bahamas has over 29.5 million surgical masks and another 691,000 cloth masks according to the Health Minister in his update. As for gloves, there are nearly 270,000,000.\n\nFrom Bahamas Ministry of Health, Facebook\n\n\u201cThe Ministry of Health will continue to trump up efforts to ensure that our frontline health care workers are provided with appropriate PPEs and training to minimize their level of exposure to the COVID19 virus.\u201d\n\nDr. Judson Eneas\n\nThe Bahamas, up to Monday April 6 recorded 33 positives for COVID-19 and five deaths, including a medical doctor.\n\nDr. Judson Eneas, 71, died on Sunday April 5 as a result of contracting the coronavirus; one of five medical care workers who had been infected in service to the public.","tests":"['1,000 test kits']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

Although it's is only a small nation, their approach is already providing some fascinating insights into the COVID-19 and the current pandemic.\n\nIceland health authorities, together with private biopharmaceutical company deCode Genetics, have so far administered 12,615 tests across the country, accounting for almost 3.5 percent of the total population. For context, the US has tested around 540,252 people, around 0.16 of the population.\n\nUnlike most other countries, Iceland has been offering free screening among the general population even if they don\u2019t have any symptoms. This testing has identified up to 802 confirmed COVID-19 infections, at least 253 of which were obtained by a foreign traveler.\n\nYou can see all of the testing results on the health ministry\u2019s COVID-19 live data page.\n\nWhat can we learn from this data? Well, first thing\u2019s first: these are preliminary results, for the time being, so we can't take them as gospel. Equally, every country has a unique infrastructure, culture, and social structure, so each country\u2019s outbreak may not necessarily \u201cbehave\u201d like Iceland\u2019s.\n\nThe most interesting revelation is that Iceland\u2019s data suggests around half of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in the country did not display any symptoms.\n\n\u201cEarly results from deCode Genetics indicate that a low proportion of the general population has contracted the virus and that about half of those who tested positive are non-symptomatic. The other half displays very moderate cold-like symptoms,\u201d Thorolfur Gu\u00f0nason, Iceland\u2019s chief epidemiologist, told Buzzfeed News.\n\nThe work has also allowed researchers to understand how the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has mutated within the country. In one unique situation, it even appears that one Icelandic person was infected with two different variants of SARS-CoV-2 with subtly different genetic material.\n\n\u201cWe have found 40 island-specific virus mutations. We found someone who had a mixture of viruses,\" explains K\u00e1ri Stef\u00e1nsson, director of deCode Genetics speaking to Danish newspaper Information. \"They had viruses from before and after the mutation, and the only infections traceable to that person are the mutated virus.\u201d\n\nWhile this number of mutations is slightly higher than other estimates, it\u2019s nothing to worry about. According to Nathan Grubaugh, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health, mutations are a natural part of the virus lifecycle and \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t worry when a virus mutates during disease outbreaks.\u201d By and large, preliminary data suggests SARS-CoV-2 has a relatively stable genome.\n\nIceland's small population means it's in a unique situation to carry out this kind of testing strategy, but every country would be doing this in an ideal world. The World Health Organization (WHO) has maintained that all countries need to start widespread testing for COVID-19, even among people who don't have symptoms. If we don't have the data, they say, the pandemic cannot be fought effectively.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fight a fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don't know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries; test, test, test,\" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said on March 16.","tests":"['12,615 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

While most affected countries are only testing those who display severe symptoms, Iceland wants to test everyone in the country for the novel coronavirus.\n\nIt can afford to do so in part thanks to its relatively low population, but also due to its well-organized and well-funded medical system. Iceland has currently carried out 10,000 tests \u2014 this is far less than what other countries have done, but on a per capita basis, Iceland ranks first in the world.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cIceland\u2019s population puts it in the unique position of having very high testing capabilities with help from the Icelandic medical research company deCode Genetics, who are offering to perform large scale testing,\u201d Thorolfur Gu\u00f0nason, Iceland\u2019s chief epidemiologist, told BuzzFeed News. \u201cThis effort is intended to gather insight into the actual prevalence of the virus in the community, as most countries are most exclusively testing symptomatic individuals at this time.\u201d\n\nNot all the results from Iceland\u2019s tests have come through yet, but the ones that have, show that half of all cases are asymptomatic (at the time of testing).\n\nThis would suggest that, on one hand, the virus is not as dangerous as we thought, but on the other hand, it would also suggest that it has spread far more than we are currently aware of.\n\nThese results are also indicated by a testing survey carried on an entire Italian town of Vo (population 3,300), where the results showed that more than 50% of all cases are asymptomatic.\n\nThe whole population of the village was tested, and 3% of the residents tested positive. Then, after a two-week lockdown, the population was tested again. The transmission had been reduced by 90% and the results were confirmed: the majority of cases seem to be asymptomatic.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLuca Zaia, the governor of the Veneto region told Italian media this week:\n\n\u201cWe tested everyone, even if the \u2018experts\u2019 told us this was a mistake: 3,000 tests. We found 66 positives, whom we isolated for 14 days, and after that 6 of them were still positive. And that is how we ended it.\u201d\n\nThis strongly emphasizes the need for mass testing, as quickly as possible.\n\nThis is still a rapidly unfolding situation where we are learning new things every day. It\u2019s important to have a bigger-picture understanding of how the infection spreads. Of course, there is a finite government testing capacity, but expanding that capacity can pay great dividends in both the short and the long run.\n\nSimilar studies carried on Chinese patients report similar things: the virus is spreading far more than we are anticipating. For every known case, there are five or ten people whose symptoms go undetected.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 is proving to be a \u201cstealth virus\u201d in that we now know a significant amount of transmission is through people who don\u2019t have symptoms. The exact % will depend on setting, but is high enough to make testing and surveillance key tools,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Quick in a Reddit AMA.\n\nThe World Health Organization also urges countries to expand their testing capacity as much as possible.\n\n\u201cYou cannot fight the fire blindfolded, and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don\u2019t know who is infected,\u201d director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week. \u201cWe have a simple message for all countries: Test, test, test. Test every suspected case.\u201d\n\nFor each and every one of us, there is also an important lesson to apply: we should all act as if we have COVID-19. You may only have a sour throat or a mild cough, you might not have any symptoms at all \u2014 you could still be carrying the disease.\n\nAs authorities expand testing capacity, and as researchers work on treatments, it\u2019s important that we play our part and prevent the spread of the disease.","tests":"['10,000 tests', '3,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

The country reported its first coronavirus-related death on Sunday, according to Reuters. Rihanna, a native of Barbados, had previously purchased $700,000 worth of ventilators for the island nation.\n\nBostic insisted Barbados did not have a lack of ventilators for patients who need them, but that could change moving forward as effects from the coronavirus were expected to worsen around the globe before they got better.\n\nBarbados' Minister of Health just indicated in a press conference that ventilators destined for the island had been \"paid for but seized in the United States\".

Berlin\u2019s Interior Minister Andreas GeiseI said they considered the confiscation to be \u201can act of modern piracy\u201d and urged Germany\u2019s government to demand that Washington play by international trade rules.\n\n\u201cThis is not how you deal with transatlantic partners,\u201d Geisel said. There shouldn\u2019t be \u201cwild west methods,\u201d he said, even in times of global crisis.\n\nThat same day, the Guardian reported that a French official from a hard-hit region also complained about having a shipment of medical masks from Shanghai diverted to the U.S. after being outbid by \u201cAmericans.\u201d \u201cThey offered three times the price and they proposed to pay upfront. I can\u2019t do that. I\u2019m spending taxpayers\u2019 money and I can only pay on delivery having checked the quality,\u201d the Guardian said Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse, the influential president of the \u00cele-de-France region, told BFMTV. \u201cSo we were caught out.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, President Donald Trump lashed out at the Minnesota-based N95 respiratory mask manufacturer 3M, tweeting that \u201cWe hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks.\u201d\n\nThe next day, he invoked the Defense Production Act to require 3M to prioritize orders from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for its N95 mask, and to ban \u201cunscrupulous actors and profiteers\u201d from exporting critical medical gear. The company almost immediately pushed back in a statement.\n\nThe administration, 3M said, had asked it to cease exporting its N95 respirators that it currently manufactures in the United States to the Canadian and Latin American markets.\n\n\u201cThere are, however, significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn addition, ceasing all export of respirators produced in the United States would likely cause other countries to retaliate and do the same, as some have already done. If that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease. That is the opposite of what we and the Administration, on behalf of the American people, both seek.\u201d\n\nThe company said it had already secured approval from China to export 10 million N95 respirators manufactured by 3M in China to the U.S.\n\n\u201c3M and its employees have gone above and beyond to manufacture as many N95 respirators as possible for the U.S. market,\u201d the company said.\n\nDuring Sunday\u2019s press conference, Barbados\u2019 health minister sought to reassure the nation that they had other channels to secure ventilators as the number of COVID-19 cases in the island of nearly 288,000 inhabitants rose to 56 and the first coronavirus-related death was recorded Saturday. The deceased is an 81-year-old Barbadian male who had a pre-existing medical condition.\n\nAs the number of cases in the Caribbean and Latin America continue to escalate, the role of the U.S. in helping nations in the region deal with the global pandemic is an emerging concern. Already cash-strapped, countries are facing everything from a shortage of test kits to ventilators and medical gear for health workers.\n\nRecently Haiti\u2019s new foreign minister, Claude Joseph, invoked the country\u2019s vulnerability as he sought the help of chief of missions in helping the government acquire a list of medical equipment, including 100 ventilators and 200,00 N95 masks, in addition to the $18 million worth of purchase orders that had already been made to China. Haiti currently has 21 confirmed cases and on Sunday recorded its first coronavirus-related death, a 55-year-old male with diabetes and hypertension.\n\nCuban officials also recently complained about the U.S preventing aid from getting to them, citing the U.S.\u2019s six-decade embargo. Chinese business magnate and Alibaba founder Jack Ma recently announced that his foundation was shipping 2 million masks, 400,000 rapid test kits, and 104 ventilators to 24 countries in the region, including Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Peru.\n\nBut Cuba\u2019s shipment never made it, according to Cuba\u2019s ambassador to China, Carlos M. Pereira.\n\nPereira said on his blog that Ma\u2019s foundation tried to send Cuba 100,000 face masks and 10 COVID-19 diagnostic kits along with other aid including ventilators and gloves, but the airline would not transport them, citing the U.S. embargo.

Now, America has become the latest country to be accused of stealing the medical machines designed to keep patients breathing that have become an essential fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe United States \u201cseized\u201d ventilators that were bound for Barbados and paid for by singer Rihanna, the Caribbean island nation\u2019s top health official told local media on Sunday. Barbados Minister of Health and Wellness Lt. Col. Jeffrey Bostic said his office was investigating how that happened, according to news outlet Barbados Today.\n\n\u201cThey were seized in the United States. Paid for, but seized, so we are trying to see exactly what is going to transpire there,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cBut I remind you that ventilators are one of the most in-demand items in the world today and Barbados is merely wrestling with the other 203 countries and territories around the world seeking to secure as many of these pieces of equipment as possible.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Earlier, Barbados Health Minister stated that ventilators purchased by @rihanna were seized in US; correction was subsequently issued indicating the exportation of 20 ventilators stopped in the US were stopped were not of Rihanna's order but of another philanthropic order pic.twitter.com\/9jzbbCsXve \u2014 Kevz Politics (@KevzPolitics) April 5, 2020\n\nAs of Monday, Barbados had 48 ventilators to treat its at least 56 confirmed coronavirus cases that were determined by conducting more than 500 tests for the island with a population of more than 285,000 people. The country reported its first coronavirus-related death on Sunday, according to Reuters. Rihanna, a native of Barbados, had previously purchased $700,000 worth of ventilators for the island nation.\n\nBostic insisted Barbados did not have a lack of ventilators for patients who need them, but that could change moving forward as effects from the coronavirus were expected to worsen around the globe before they got better.\n\nBarbados' Minister of Health just indicated in a press conference that ventilators destined for the island had been \"paid for but seized in the United States\". It's every country for itself out here and the small ones will be the biggest losers. \u2014 Lisa Harewood (@islandcinephile) April 5, 2020\n\n\u201cSo it is absurd for anyone to say, suggest, imply or insinuate that there is a shortage or could in the foreseeable future be an acute shortage of ventilators on the island,\u201d Bostic said. \u201cWe have an adequate amount of ventilators at this point and ventilators have been arriving almost daily over the past two weeks or so. But up to this point, we have only had to use three ventilators.\u201d\n\nHave you noticed how they have cameras and press present for the landings of these big PPE shipments? It\u2019s the best way to avoid federal seizure of the donations. Thanks to everyone fighting our own government to get this stuff into the country and inside hospitals. https:\/\/t.co\/1AXhs9CfgT \u2014 Chris Sacca (@sacca) April 6, 2020\n\nThat claim stood in stark contrast to the fact there is a decided shortage of ventilators in the U.S., where most of the machines promised by President Donald Trump weren\u2019t expected to be ready for months.\n\nBREAKING: House Overisght Committee reports that FEMA officials told them this week that only 9,500 ventilators are in the national stockpile and only 3,200 more will be there by April 13. Bulk of 100K ventilators promised by Trump won't be there until June. pic.twitter.com\/760qjehg6K \u2014 Kyle Cheney (@kyledcheney) April 2, 2020\n\nThe coronavirus has been gradually spreading in the Caribbean with cases and\/or deaths reported in at least 22 countries and territories.\n\nAside from the allegations out of Barbados, there have been a fair amount of reports in the U.S. of personal protective equipment (PPEs) like ventilators and the coveted N-95 masks being \u201cseized.\u201d Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., said the other day that he was planning to take ventilators from places not using theirs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to be in a position where people are dying and we have several hundred ventilators in our own state, somewhere else,\u201d Cuomo said Friday about using the National Guard to seize ventilators and protective equipment from hospitals and other health care facilities in upstate New York. \u201cI apologize for the hardship to those institutions \u2014 ultimately there is no hardship, if you don\u2019t get the ventilator back, I give you my personal word I will pay you for the ventilator \u2014 but I\u2019m not going to let people die because we didn\u2019t redeploy these ventilators.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. isn\u2019t the only country being allegedly stealing PPEs as nations continue to deal with a global pandemic that they were wholly unprepared for. Spain accused Turkey of doing the same thing over the weekend and the Czech Republic finally relayed 110,000 face masks to Italy after having seized them first.\n\nThere\u2019s also the case of the U.S. federal government seizing PPE shipments intended for states. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said last week that 3 million face masks the state ordered were \u201cconfiscated in the port of New York.\n\nThis is America.\n\nSEE ALSO:\n\n5 Reasons Why Black People Are Disproportionately Contracting The Coronavirus\n\nFormer NFL Player-Turned-Doctor Myron Rolle Is Helping Combat COVID-19","tests":"['500 tests']","ventilators":"['9,500 ventilators', '48 ventilators', '20 ventilators']","beds":null,"ppe":null}

To date, 29 tests were done with 28 being negative.\n\nOn Saturday, March 28, the laboratory director at the Ezra Long Laboratory of the Owen King EU Hospital reported one positive case which brings our national total of confirmed cases of COVID-19 to four.\n\nThis is the first positive case from local testing.\n\nThe individual is a 49-year-old female national, nurse by profession, with a travel history to the United Kingdom.\n\nShe returned to Saint Lucia on Saturday, March 21 and was placed in quarantine during which time she developed a cough and samples were taken for testing. Her results have confirmed that she is positive for COVID-19 and she has since been transferred into isolation. The individual is doing well and she is in good spirits.\n\nThe Department of Health is currently undertaking routine contact-tracing as required by our protocol.\n\nAs indicated in a press update earlier this week, the first two confirmed cases of COVID-19 were repatriated to the United Kingdom this week. The third case has recovered but has been kept in isolation as a precautionary measure to minimize any possible risk of transmission.\n\nTo date, Saint Lucia has over 300 persons in quarantine. This quarantine is a combination of home-based and facility-based quarantine; approximately 260 in facility quarantine and about 50 in-home quarantine.\n\nFacility quarantine commenced on Friday, March 20 and to date, three facilities have been established for this purpose. Persons managed at the facility-based quarantine sites are managed at the expense of the state and this includes the provision of their boarding, meals as well as their medical assessments and monitoring.\n\nAll persons in facility-based quarantine are doing well and have developed no symptoms of COVID-19 to date. As such, there has been no need for testing of these individuals. In keeping with global standards and protocols, testing is done only when persons develop symptoms of the virus to ensure the accuracy of testing results.\n\nEffective Monday, March 23, 2020, the Government of Saint Lucia instituted a national country scale down of national services for a period of two weeks.\n\nThe public has been guided that this measure is put in place to reduce direct person-to-person contact and as such, reduce the potential risk of transmission of COVID-19.\n\nThis measure requires the support and compliance of all to adopt an unusual physical distance from other persons or objects in public places.\n\nThough this may be seemingly difficult, the measure is one of the most effective and means of preventing local transmission and requires the input of every single individual in making our national response to COVID-19 effective.\n\nBy each and everyone playing their part during this scale down by remaining at home, avoiding social activities and public places together we will be better placed to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nWe continue to advise the public to focus on the maintenance of standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection.\n\nThese include: \u2013 \u2013 regular handwashing with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer where soap and water is not available. \u2013 \u2013 cover mouth and nose with disposable tissues or clothing when coughing and sneezing. \u2013\n\n\u2013 avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. \u2013 seek medical attention and share your travel history with your health care provider if you have symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel.\n\nThe Department of Health and Wellness will continue providing regular updates on COVID-19.","tests":"['29 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

This great union is up to the challenges of the moment.\u201d\n\nBelgium has been in a political impasse for months after last May\u2019s general election exposed deep linguistic and regional divisions in the country. Belgium\u2019s first female prime minister, Wilmes was appointed in October to succeed liberal leader Charles Michel, who became president of the European Council.\n\nIn an attempt to stop the spreading of the COVID-19 virus, Wilmes\u2019 government has closed schools, bars and restaurants and suspended all sports and cultural events.

He warns of a high risk of internal virus transmission with \u201cthe problem of inequality in our society.\u201d\n\nSouth Africans worry about the spread of the virus to crowded townships or public transport. Confirmed virus cases have doubled every two days over 10 days to 61, a rate he called \u201cexplosive.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Africa\u2019s second most populous nation, Ethiopia, has suspended schools, sporting events and other large gatherings for 15 days.\n\n___\n\nBavarian authorities say that runoff mayoral elections in the southern German state will be conducted entirely by postal vote to reduce risks of infection with the new coronavirus.\n\nPolling stations opened as usual, though with increased hygienic precautions, for the first round of municipal elections on Sunday.\n\nOn Monday, though, Bavaria\u2019s state government tightened its restrictions on public life, saying that it would close bars, cinemas and some shops among other things. The regional interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said that the runoff votes in two weeks will be held \u201cexclusively by postal ballot.\u201d\n\nAmong the cities and towns where a runoff vote will be needed is the state capital, Munich, where center-left mayor Dieter Reiter fell narrowly short of the 50% support needed to avoid a second round.\n\n___\n\nThe government of Kosovo has declared the state of emergency due to the coronavirus threat.

Police turned back some pedestrians at Kehl, across the Rhine river from the French city of Strasbourg.\n\nPeople who commute across the border to work are still allowed to cross, as can trucks carrying goods, and Germans are being allowed back in. But Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said that people \u201cwithout a valid reason to travel\u201d wouldn\u2019t be allowed across.\n\nThat, for example, ends trips to shops across the border for now.\n\nDenmark shut own border over the weekend \u2013 as did two eastern neighbors of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. Lithuania\u2019s government said a convoy of some 500 vehicles \u2014 mostly Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians and Ukrainians \u2014 will be allowed to enter Poland from Germany and transit toward Lithuania on Monday.\n\nGermany has confirmed over 4,800 infections with the new coronavirus, including 12 deaths.\n\n___\n\nBangladesh\u2019s government has shut down all all educational institutions and private tutorial centers across the country until March 31.\n\nEducation Minister Dipu Moni said at a news conference Monday in Bangladesh\u2019s capital, Dhaka, that the measures were taken as a precautionary step against the coronavirus.

Pupils in the last year of secondary school will also return to class and sport will recommence without spectators.\n\nThe success of the Faroese approach is said by local politicians to be largely a result of the foresight of the veterinary scientist Debes Christiansen, the head of department at the National Reference Laboratory for Fish and Animal Diseases in the capital, T\u00f3rshavn.\n\nChristiansen had warned the government of the self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark as early as January of the need to prepare for the possible spread of the disease from China.\n\nHis laboratory, which was primarily geared to test salmon for viral infection, was adapted and he purchased the extra ingredients required to test humans. There has been mass testing for virus among salmon farmed in Faroese waters since an outbreak of salmon anaemia virus in 2001 ravaged the species. Of the archipelago\u2019s total export value, 90% is accounted for by fish and half of that is salmon.\n\nAccording to official records, 10% of the population of 61,000 people have now been tested for the coronavirus. Faroese doctors have been able to track and quarantine everyone who has had contact with the 184 people who had tested positive for the virus. Of those who have fallen ill, 131 have fully recovered.\n\nChristiansen told the Guardian that the switch to human testing had not involved \u201ctoo much hocus pocus\u201d and that his veterinarian laboratory had been able to source materials required for the tests from a wider range of suppliers than hospitals.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Debes Christiansen in his laboratory. Photograph: Therese Soltveit \/ Kyst.no\n\nHe said: \u201cIt is very easy to adapt. The only thing I changed were some of the ingredients. In our normal work it is specific to fish virus and fish bacteria and in this case I just changed the three components specific to the coronavirus.\u201d\n\nChristiansen said his facility could do up to 1,000 tests a day if required and the research assistants were available He said the latest batch of test samples on Tuesday had been negative.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt seems that there isn\u2019t a high load of virus in the Faroese environment at the moment. Everyone is talking about those black figures [of patients now showing symptoms] but we have tested more than 10% of the population so I don\u2019t think we have that have that many running around who are infected.\u201d\n\nKristina H\u00e1foss, an opposition MP who was the country\u2019s finance minister until 2019, praised Christiansen\u2019s swift action and that of the government in setting up a drive-in testing facility at the main hospital in the capital and a quarantine at an airport hotel.\n\nShe said: \u201cIf we had had to send the tests to Denmark for analysis it takes days and up to a week to get them back and it wouldn\u2019t have been possible to control the disease the way we have done.\n\n\u201cTracking and tracing has been a very important part. It has been possible to trace all the people who have been tested positive and who they have been with. And they have been put in quarantine for two weeks.\u201d","tests":"['1,000 tests']","ventilators":null,"beds":null,"ppe":null}

(TOMDF), a pre-commercial stage in-vitro diagnostics company focused on the development of blood tests for the early detection of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, today announced it has entered into an exclusive distribution agreement for the United States and Israel (the \u201cDistribution Agreement\u201d) with Gibraltar Brothers & Associates, LLC, a U.S.-based subsidiary of Shanghai Liangrun Biomedicine Technology Co. (\u201cShanghai\u201d), for its proprietary colloidal gold immunochromatography test (\u201cColloidal Gold\u201d).\n\nColloidal Gold has been approved as a diagnostic test for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in China by the NMPA (formerly the China FDA) and in Europe under a CE Mark. Todos will be responsible for obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and plans to do so under the Emergency Use Authorization Program.\n\nShanghai has shipped test kits for validation by Todos. During the four-week validation process, Todos intends to place its first purchase order based upon the market demand identified. Shanghai currently has 500,000 Colloidal Gold test kits in stock, and has indicated to Todos that it can manufacture up to 300,000 test kits per day to help meet the demand in the U.S., given that demand for test kits in China has begun to decline.\n\nCOLLOIDAL GOLD NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) TEST KIT VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nVIDEO LINK: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bqkqUkZljFs&feature=youtu.be\n\nThe Colloidal Gold point-of-care (POC) test kit uses a drop of blood from a finger prick to test for antibodies to COVID-19. The test kit contains a detection kit, a lancet, a disinfectant wipe, a micropipette, a cotton ball and the reagent. The kit comes in a sealed plastic bag and includes instructions; the only thing not included is a timer. This is a rapid test that takes between two and 10 minutes to obtain results, compared with the nasal swab test currently in widespread use that takes two to three days for results.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to see Todos take on the task of bringing additional COVID-19 testing capacity into the United States, where we expect significant demand in the coming months as we grapple with the international pandemic,\u201d said Jorge Leon, Ph.D., Chief Medical Advisor to Todos. \u201cThe IgM antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus appears at days 5-6 after infection showing recent exposure to the virus, and lasts for up to three weeks, therefore it is an important test to increase the window of diagnostic sensitivity of true positive cases since the molecular test (nucleic acid test), despite being the gold standard, is not always positive in some patients during the early course of infection. The IgG antibody response peaks at day 21 and lasts for years, indicating the patient was infected with the virus. The Colloidal Gold IgM\/IgG tests has become a very important test in the coronavirus testing paradigm, and we will be working to validate the assay here in the United States in the coming weeks in preparation for commercial launch under CLIA and parallel interactions with U.S. federal authorities to expedite its path to FDA approval using the recently enacted Emergency Use Authorization Program. Because Colloidal Gold tests for antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2), instead of testing for the virus itself, this test will be different and complementary to the nucleic acid test Todos will be validating in parallel. Validating and making available the Colloidal Gold and lab-based molecular testing together or in parallel has the potential to create a new paradigm in the screening for COVID-19 that we believe may allow for EUA from US FDA for Colloidal Gold POC test kit.\u201d\n\nTodos and Provista Diagnostics, Inc. have agreed to use Provista\u2019s lab in Alpharetta, Georgia to conduct the validation required to launch the test in the U.S. under CLIA.
